      <title>Depression diagnosis from patient interviews using multimodal machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Depression is a major public health concern, affecting an estimated five percent of the global population. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential to initiate effective treatment, yet recognition remains challenging in many clinical contexts. Speech, language, and behavioral cues collected during patient interviews may provide objective markers that support clinical assessment.
  Methods: We developed a diagnostic approach that integrates features derived from patient interviews, including speech patterns, linguistic characteristics, and structured clinical information. Separate models were trained for each modality and subsequently combined through multimodal fusion to reflect the complexity of real-world psychiatric assessment. Model validity was assessed with established performance metrics, and further evaluated using calibration and decision-analytic approaches to estimate potential clinical utility.
  Results: The multimodal model achieved superior diagnostic accuracy compared to single-modality models, with an AUROC of 0.88 and an F1-score of 0.75. Importantly, the fused model demonstrated good calibration and offered higher net clinical benefit compared to baseline strategies, highlighting its potential to assist clinicians in identifying patients with depression more reliably.
  Conclusion: Multimodal analysis of patient interviews using machine learning may serve as a valuable adjunct to psychiatric evaluation. By combining speech, language, and clinical features, this approach provides a robust framework that could enhance early detection of depressive disorders and support evidence-based decision-making in mental healthcare.</description>

      <title>1-Bit Unlimited Sampling Beyond Fourier Domain: Low-Resolution Sampling of Quantization Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) play a critical role in digital signal acquisition across various applications, but their performance is inherently constrained by sampling rates and bit budgets. This bit budget imposes a trade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy consumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit depth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with low-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with Sigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However, SDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to handle inputs with arbitrary DR. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) addresses this challenge by injecting modulo non-linearity in hardware, resulting in a new digital sensing technology. In this paper, we introduce a novel 1-Bit sampling architecture that extends both conventional 1-Bit SDQ and USF. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We generalize the concept of noise shaping beyond the Fourier domain, allowing the inclusion of non-bandlimited signals in the Fourier domain but bandlimited in alternative transform domains. (2) Building on this generalization, we develop a new transform-domain recovery method for 1-Bit USF. When applied to the Fourier domain, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing time-domain techniques, offering reduced oversampling requirements and improved robustness. Extensive numerical experiments validate our findings, laying the groundwork for a broader generalization of 1-Bit sampling systems.</description>

      <title>In-Lab Carrier Aggregation Testbed for Satellite Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier Aggregation (CA) is a technique used in 5G and previous cellular generations to temporarily increase the data rate of a specific user during peak demand periods or to reduce carrier congestion. CA is achieved by combining two or more carriers and providing a virtual, wider overall bandwidth to high-demand users of the system. CA was introduced in the 4G/LTE wireless era and has been proven effective in 5G as well, where it is said to play a significant role in efficient network capacity management. Given this success, the satellite communication (SatCom) community has put its attention into CA and the potential benefits it can bring in terms of better spectrum utilization and better meeting the user traffic demand. While the theoretical evaluation of CA for SatCom has already been presented in several works, this article presents the design and results obtained with an experimentation testbed based on Software Defined Radio (SDR) and a satellite channel emulator. We first present the detailed implementation design, which includes a Gateway (GW) module responsible for PDU-scheduling across the aggregated carriers, and a User Terminal (UT) module responsible for aggregating the multiple received streams. The second part of the article presents the experimental evaluation, including CA over a single Geostationary (GEO) satellite, CA over a single Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite, and CA combining carriers sent over GEO and MEO satellites. A key contribution of this work is the explicit consideration of multi-orbit scenarios in the testbed design and validation. The testing results show promising benefits of CA over SatCom systems, motivating potential upcoming testing on over-the-air systems.</description>

      <title>Fourth-Order Hierarchical Array: A Novel Scheme for Sparse Array Design Based on Fourth-Order Difference Co-Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional array designs based on circular fourth-order cumulant typically adopt a single expression form of the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA), which limits the achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs) and neglects the impact of mutual coupling among physical sensors. To address above issues, this paper proposes a novel scheme to design arrays with increased DOFs by combining different forms of FODCA while accounting for mutual coupling. A novel fourth-order hierarchical array (FOHA) based on different forms of FODCA is constructed using an arbitrary generator set. The analytical expression between the coupling leakage of the generator and the resulting FOHA is derived. Two specific FOHA configurations are presented with closed-form sensor placements. The arrays not only offer increased DOFs for resolving more sources in direction of-arrival (DOA) estimation but also effectively suppress mutual coupling. Moreover, the redundancy of FODCA is examined, and it is shown that arrays based on the proposed scheme achieve lower redundancy compared to existing arrays based on FODCA. Meanwhile, the necessary and sufficient conditions for signal reconstruction by FOHA are derived. Compared with existing arrays based on FODCA, the proposed arrays provide enhanced DOFs and improved robustness against mutual coupling. Numerical simulations verify that FOHAs achieve superior DOA estimation performance compared with other sparse linear arrays.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antenna System for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the pinching antenna system (PASS) has attracted considerable attention due to their advantages in flexible deployment and reduction of signal propagation loss. In this work, a multiple waveguide PASS assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is proposed, where the base station (BS) is equipped with transmitting pinching antennas (PAs) and receiving uniform linear array (ULA) antennas. The full-duplex (FD) BS transmits the communication and sensing signals through the PAs on waveguides and collects the echo sensing signals with the mounted ULA. Based on this configuration, a target sensing Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) minimization problem is formulated under communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, power budget constraint, and PA deployment constraints. The alternating optimization (AO) method is employed to address the formulated non-convex optimization problem. In each iteration, the overall optimization problem is decomposed into a digital beamforming sub-problem and a pinching beamforming sub-problem. The sensing covariance matrix and communication beamforming matrix at the BS are optimized by solving the digital beamforming sub-problem with semidefinite relaxation (SDR). The PA deployment is updated by solving the pinching beamforming sub-problem with the successive convex approximation (SCA) method, penalty method, and element-wise optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed PASS assisted ISAC framework achieves superior performance over benchmark schemes, is less affected by stringent communication constraints compared to conventional MIMO-ISAC, and benefits further from increasing the number of waveguides and PAs per waveguide.</description>

      <title>CSRD2025: A Large-Scale Synthetic Radio Dataset for Spectrum Sensing in Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Large AI Models (LAMs) for wireless communications, particularly for complex tasks like spectrum sensing, is critically dependent on the availability of vast, diverse, and realistic datasets. Addressing this need, this paper introduces the ChangShuoRadioData (CSRD) framework, an open-source, modular simulation platform designed for generating large-scale synthetic radio frequency (RF) data. CSRD simulates the end-to-end transmission and reception process, incorporating an extensive range of modulation schemes (100 types, including analog, digital, OFDM, and OTFS), configurable channel models featuring both statistical fading and site-specific ray tracing using OpenStreetMap data, and detailed modeling of realistic RF front-end impairments for various antenna configurations (SISO/MISO/MIMO). Using this framework, we characterize CSRD2025, a substantial dataset benchmark comprising over 25,000,000 frames (approx. 200TB), which is approximately 10,000 times larger than the widely used RML2018 dataset. CSRD2025 offers unprecedented signal diversity and complexity, specifically engineered to bridge the Sim2Real gap. Furthermore, we provide processing pipelines to convert IQ data into spectrograms annotated in COCO format, facilitating object detection approaches for time-frequency signal analysis. The dataset specification includes standardized 8:1:1 training, validation, and test splits (via frame indices) to ensure reproducible research. The CSRD framework is released at https://github.com/Singingkettle/ChangShuoRadioData to accelerate the advancement of AI-driven spectrum sensing and management.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Learning-Based Beamforming for ISAC-Enabled V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an energy-efficient, learning-based beamforming scheme for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled V2X networks. Specifically, we first model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X environments as a Markov Decision Process. This formulation allows the roadside unit to generate beamforming decisions based solely on current sensing information, thereby eliminating the need for frequent pilot transmissions and extensive channel state information acquisition. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and power allocation, ensuring both communication throughput and sensing accuracy in highly dynamic scenario. To address the high energy demands of conventional learning-based schemes, we embed spiking neural networks (SNNs) into the DRL framework. Leveraging their event-driven and sparsely activated architecture, SNNs significantly enhance energy efficiency while maintaining robust performance. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method achieves substantial energy savings and superior communication performance, demonstrating its potential to support green and sustainable connectivity in future V2X systems.</description>

      <title>Code-Weight Sphere Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19631v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand high-performance error-correcting codes and decoders in the finite blocklength regime. This letter introduces a novel two-stage near-maximum likelihood (near-ML) decoding framework applicable to any linear block code. Our approach first employs a low-complexity initial decoder. If this initial stage fails a cyclic redundancy check, it triggers a second stage: the proposed code-weight sphere decoding (WSD). WSD iteratively refines the codeword estimate by exploring a localized sphere of candidates constructed from pre-computed low-weight codewords. This strategy adaptively minimizes computational overhead at high signal-to-noise ratios while achieving near-ML performance, especially for low-rate codes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our two-stage decoder provides an excellent trade-off between decoding reliability and complexity, establishing it as a promising solution for next-generation URLLC systems.</description>

      <title>Invited Paper: Feature-to-Classifier Co-Design for Mixed-Signal Smart Flexible Wearables for Healthcare at the Extreme Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible Electronics (FE) offer a promising alternative to rigid silicon-based hardware for wearable healthcare devices, enabling lightweight, conformable, and low-cost systems. However, their limited integration density and large feature sizes impose strict area and power constraints, making ML-based healthcare systems-integrating analog frontend, feature extraction and classifier-particularly challenging. Existing FE solutions often neglect potential system-wide solutions and focus on the classifier, overlooking the substantial hardware cost of feature extraction and Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs)-both major contributors to area and power consumption. In this work, we present a holistic mixed-signal feature-to-classifier co-design framework for flexible smart wearable systems. To the best of our knowledge, we design the first analog feature extractors in FE, significantly reducing feature extraction cost. We further propose an hardware-aware NAS-inspired feature selection strategy within ML training, enabling efficient, application-specific designs. Our evaluation on healthcare benchmarks shows our approach delivers highly accurate, ultra-area-efficient flexible systems-ideal for disposable, low-power wearable monitoring.</description>

      <title>Demonstrator Testbed for Effective Precoding in MEO Multibeam Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of communication satellites in medium Earth orbit (MEO) is foreseen to provide quasi-global broadband Internet connectivity in the coming networking ecosystems. Multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) digital signal processing techniques, such as precoding, emerge as appealing technological enablers in the forward link of multi-beam satellite systems operating in full frequency reuse (FFR). However, the orbit dynamics of MEO satellites pose additional challenges that must be carefully evaluated and addressed. This work presents the design of an in-lab testbed based on software-defined radio (SDR) platforms and the corresponding adaptations required for efficient precoding in a MEO scenario. The setup incorporates a precise orbit model and the radiation pattern of a custom-designed direct radiating array (DRA). We analyze the main impairments affecting precoding performance, including Doppler shifts and payload phase noise, and propose a synchronization loop to mitigate these effects. Preliminary experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Precision Printed Ternary Neural Networks with Holistic Evolutionary Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Printed electronics offer a promising alternative for applications beyond silicon-based systems, requiring properties like flexibility, stretchability, conformality, and ultra-low fabrication costs. Despite the large feature sizes in printed electronics, printed neural networks have attracted attention for meeting target application requirements, though realizing complex circuits remains challenging. This work bridges the gap between classification accuracy and area efficiency in printed neural networks, covering the entire processing-near-sensor system design and co-optimization from the analog-to-digital interface-a major area and power bottleneck-to the digital classifier. We propose an automated framework for designing printed Ternary Neural Networks with arbitrary input precision, utilizing multi-objective optimization and holistic approximation. Our circuits outperform existing approximate printed neural networks by 17x in area and 59x in power on average, being the first to enable printed-battery-powered operation with under 5% accuracy loss while accounting for analog-to-digital interfacing costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), a biological material produced by non-pathogenic bacteria that possesses excellent material properties for various medical applications, has received increased interest as a carrier system for drug delivery. However, the vast majority of existing studies on drug release from BNC are feasibility studies with modeling and design aspects remaining largely unexplored. To narrow this research gap, this paper proposes a novel model for the drug release from BNC. Specifically, the drug delivery system considered in this paper consists of a BNC fleece coated with a polymer. The polymer coating is used as an additional diffusion barrier, enabling the controlled release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The proposed physics-based model reflects the geometry of the BNC and incorporates the impact of the polymer coating on the drug release. Hence, it can be useful for designing BNC-based drug delivery systems in the future. The accuracy of the model is validated with experimental data obtained in wet lab experiments.</description>

      <title>On Minimization/Maximization of the Generalized Multi-Order Complex Quadratic Form With Constant-Modulus Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalized problem that minimizes or maximizes a multi-order complex quadratic form with constant-modulus constraints on all elements of its optimization variable. Such a mathematical problem is commonly encountered in various applications of signal processing. We term it as the constant-modulus multi-order complex quadratic programming (CMCQP) in this paper. In general, the CMCQP is non-convex and difficult to solve. Its objective function typically relates to metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio, Cram\'er-Rao bound, integrated sidelobe level, etc., and constraints normally correspond to requirements on similarity to desired aspects, peak-to-average-power ratio, or constant-modulus property in practical scenarios. In order to find efficient solutions to the CMCQP, we first reformulate it into an unconstrained optimization problem with respect to phase values of the studied variable only. Then, we devise a steepest descent/ascent method with fast determinations on its optimal step sizes. Specifically, we convert the step-size searching problem into a polynomial form that leads to closed-form solutions of high accuracy, wherein the third-order Taylor expansion of the search function is conducted. Our major contributions also lie in investigating the effect of the order and specific form of matrices embedded in the CMCQP, for which two representative cases are identified. Examples of related applications associated with the two cases are also provided for completeness. The proposed methods are summarized into algorithms, whose convergence speeds are verified to be fast by comprehensive simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The accuracy of our proposed fast step-size determination is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Experimental End-to-End Optimization of Directly Modulated Laser-based IM/DD Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directly modulated lasers (DMLs) are an attractive technology for short-reach intensity modulation and direct detection communication systems. However, their complex nonlinear dynamics make the modeling and optimization of DML-based systems challenging. In this paper, we study the end-to-end optimization of DML-based systems based on a data-driven surrogate model trained on experimental data. The end-to-end optimization includes the pulse shaping and equalizer filters, the bias current and the modulation radio-frequency (RF) power applied to the laser. The performance of the end-to-end optimization scheme is tested on the experimental setup and compared to 4 different benchmark schemes based on linear and nonlinear receiver-side equalization. The results show that the proposed end-to-end scheme is able to deliver better performance throughout the studied symbol rates and transmission distances while employing lower modulation RF power, fewer filter taps and utilizing a smaller signal bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Based Physical-Layer Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we exploit the cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) architecture to design a physical-layer authentication (PLA) framework that can simultaneously authenticate multiple distributed users across the coverage area. Our proposed scheme remains effective even in the presence of active adversaries attempting impersonation attacks to disrupt the authentication process. Specifically, we introduce a tag-based PLA CFmMIMO system, wherein the access points (APs) first estimate their channels with the legitimate users during an uplink training phase. Subsequently, a unique secret key is generated and securely shared between each user and the APs. We then formulate a hypothesis testing problem and derive a closed-form expression for the probability of detection for each user in the network. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating that it maintains a high detection probability even as the number of users in the system increases.</description>

      <title>The Coherent Multiplex: Scalable Real-Time Wavelet Coherence Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coherent Multiplex is formalized and validated as a scalable, real-time system for identifying, analyzing, and visualizing coherence among multiple time series. Its architecture comprises a fast spectral similarity layer based on cosine similarity metrics of Fourier-transformed signals, and a sparse time-frequency layer for wavelet coherence. The system constructs and evolves a multilayer graph representing inter-signal relationships, enabling low-latency inference and monitoring. A simulation prototype demonstrates functionality across 8 synthetic channels with a high similarity threshold for further computation, with additional opportunities for scaling the architecture up to support thousands of input signals with constrained hardware. Applications discussed include neuroscience, finance, and biomedical signal analysis.</description>

      <title>Towards 6G Intelligence: The Role of Generative AI in Future Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambient intelligence (AmI) is a computing paradigm in which physical environments are embedded with sensing, computation, and communication so they can perceive people and context, decide appropriate actions, and respond autonomously. Realizing AmI at global scale requires sixth generation (6G) wireless networks with capabilities for real time perception, reasoning, and action aligned with human behavior and mobility patterns. We argue that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is the creative core of such environments. Unlike traditional AI, GenAI learns data distributions and can generate realistic samples, making it well suited to close key AmI gaps, including generating synthetic sensor and channel data in under observed areas, translating user intent into compact, semantic messages, predicting future network conditions for proactive control, and updating digital twins without compromising privacy.
  This chapter reviews foundational GenAI models, GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and generative transformers, and connects them to practical AmI use cases, including spectrum sharing, ultra reliable low latency communication, intelligent security, and context aware digital twins. We also examine how 6G enablers, such as edge and fog computing, IoT device swarms, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), and non terrestrial networks, can host or accelerate distributed GenAI. Finally, we outline open challenges in energy efficient on device training, trustworthy synthetic data, federated generative learning, and AmI specific standardization. We show that GenAI is not a peripheral addition, but a foundational element for transforming 6G from a faster network into an ambient intelligent ecosystem.</description>

      <title>On the Outage Probability of Multiuser Multiple Antenna Systems with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for Air-Ground Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores multiuser multiple antenna systems as a means to enhance the spectral efficiency of aeronautical communications systems. To this end, the outage regime for a multiuser multiple antenna system is studied within a realistic geometry-based stochastic air-ground (AG) channel model. In this application, users (aircraft) transmit air traffic management data to the ground station at a predefined target rate. Due to the nature of the AG propagation, we argue that the relevant performance metric in this context is the information outage probability. We consider the outage probability under three decoding approaches. The first is based on successive interference cancellation (SIC). The second extends the first approach by considering joint group decoding. The third is a version of the second that limits the size of the jointly decoded user groups in order to lower the decoding complexity. The results show that joint group decoding, even in groups of only two, can significantly increase the spectral efficiency in the AG channel by allowing a large number of aircraft to transmit over a non-orthogonal channel with very low outage probabilities.</description>

      <title>Edge Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Network Optimisation in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future 6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability. Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions, compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted NOMA with Partial CSI and Mutual Coupling: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07909v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access technique. Its performance depends strongly on the wireless channel property, which can be enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this paper, we jointly optimize base station (BS) precoding and RIS configuration with unsupervised machine learning (ML), which looks for the optimal solution autonomously. In particular, we propose a dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet inspired by domain knowledge in communication. Compared to state-of-the-art, the proposed approach combines analytical optimal BS precoding and ML-enabled RIS, has a high scalability to control more than 1000 RIS elements, has a low requirement for channel state information (CSI) in input, and addresses the mutual coupling between RIS elements. Beyond the considered problem, this work is an early contribution to domain knowledge enabled ML, which exploit the domain expertise of communication systems to design better approaches than general ML methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization for Movable Antenna-aided Cell-Free ISAC with Time Synchronization Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) system, which effectively mitigates intra-cell interference and provides precise sensing accuracy, is a promising technology for future 6G networks. However, to fully capitalize on the potential of CF-ISAC, accurate time synchronization (TS) between access points (APs) is critical. Due to the limitations of current synchronization technologies, TS errors have become a significant challenge in the development of the CF-ISAC system. In this paper, we propose a novel CF-ISAC architecture based on movable antennas (MAs), which exploits spatial diversity to enhance communication rates, maintain sensing accuracy, and reduce the impact of TS errors. We formulate a worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem for TS errors to address this challenge, deriving the worst-case Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Subsequently, we develop a joint optimization framework for AP beamforming and MA positions to satisfy communication rate constraints while improving sensing accuracy. A robust optimization framework is designed for the highly complex and non-convex problem. Specifically, we employ manifold optimization (MO) to solve the worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem. Then, we propose an MA-enabled meta-reinforcement learning (MA-MetaRL) to design optimization variables while satisfying constraints on MA positions, communication rate, and transmit power, thereby improving sensing accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust optimization algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of the detection and is strong against TS errors. Moreover, compared to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) technologies, the proposed MA-aided CF-ISAC architecture achieves higher system capacity, thus validating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Synoptic Review of High-Frequency Oscillations as a Biomarker in Neurodegenerative Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs), rapid bursts of brain activity above 80 Hz, have emerged as a highly specific biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. Recent evidence suggests that HFOs are also present in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reflecting underlying network hyperexcitability and offering a promising, noninvasive tool for early diagnosis and disease tracking. This synoptic review provides a comprehensive analysis of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets relevant to HFO research in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,222 articles, revealing a significant and growing research interest in HFOs, particularly within the last ten years. We then systematically profile and compare key public datasets, evaluating their participant cohorts, data acquisition parameters, and accessibility, with a specific focus on their technical suitability for HFO analysis. Our comparative synthesis highlights critical methodological heterogeneity across datasets, particularly in sampling frequency and recording paradigms, which poses challenges for cross-study validation, but also offers opportunities for robustness testing. By consolidating disparate information, clarifying nomenclature, and providing a detailed methodological framework, this review serves as a guide for researchers aiming to leverage public data to advance the role of HFOs as a cross-disease biomarker for AD and related conditions.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Beam Squint Effect For Near-Field Wideband Communication Through Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this correspondence, we study deploying movable antenna (MA) array in a wideband multiple-input-single-output (MISO) communication system, where near-field (NF) channel model is considered. To alleviate beam squint effect, we propose to maximize the minimum analog beamforming gain across the entire wideband spectrum by appropriately adjusting MAs' positions, which is a highly challenging task. By introducing a slack variable and adopting the cutting-the-edge smoothed-gradient-descent-ascent (SGDA) method, we develop algorithms to resolve the aforementioned challenge. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the benefit of utilizing MA array to mitigate beam squint effect in NF wideband system.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Synthesis Denoisers for Forward-Backward Plug-and-Play Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the behavior of the forward-backward (FB) algorithm when the proximity operator is replaced by a sub-iterative procedure to approximate a Gaussian denoiser, in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion. In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</description>

      <title>Towards a Spatiotemporal Fusion Approach to Precipitation Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing availability of meteorological data from various sensors, numerical models and reanalysis products, the need for efficient data integration methods has become paramount for improving weather forecasts and hydrometeorological studies. In this work, we propose a data fusion approach for precipitation nowcasting by integrating data from meteorological and rain gauge stations in Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area with ERA5 reanalysis data and GFS numerical weather prediction. We employ the spatiotemporal deep learning architecture called STConvS2S, leveraging a structured dataset covering a 9 x 11 grid. The study spans from January 2011 to October 2024, and we evaluate the impact of integrating three surface station systems. Among the tested configurations, the fusion-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.2033 for forecasting heavy precipitation events (greater than 25 mm/h) at a one-hour lead time. Additionally, we present an ablation study to assess the contribution of each station network and propose a refined inference strategy for precipitation nowcasting, integrating the GFS numerical weather prediction (NWP) data with in-situ observations.</description>
