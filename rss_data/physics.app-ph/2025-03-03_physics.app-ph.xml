      <title>Dynamics of DNA-Templated Ultrafine Silver Nanowires Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research on silver nanowires prepared on DNA templates has focused on two fundamental applications: nano-scale circuits and sensors. Despite its broad potential, the formation kinetics of DNA-templated silver nanowires remains unclear. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of the formation of silver nanowires with a diameter of 2.2+0.4 nm at the single-molecule level through chemical reduction. We conducted equilibrium and perturbation kinetic experiments to measure force spectroscopy during the formation of Ag+ -DNA complexes and Ag-DNA complexes, using optical tweezers combined with microfluidics. The addition of AgNO3 resulted in an increase in force of 5.5-7.5 pN within 2 minutes, indicating that Ag+ compacts the DNA structure. In contrast, the addition of hydroquinone caused the force to decrease by 4-5 pN. Morphological characterization confirmed the presence of a dense structure formed by silver atoms bridging the DNA strands, and revealed conformational differences before and after metallization. We compare our experimental data with Brownian dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) model that provides insights on the dependency of the force on the persistence length.</description>

      <title>Impact of Quantum Well Thickness on Efficiency Loss in InGaN/GaN LEDs: Challenges for Thin-Well Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of quantum well (QW) thickness on efficiency loss in c-plane InGaN/GaN LEDs using a small-signal electroluminescence (SSEL) technique. Multiple mechanisms related to efficiency loss are independently examined, including injection efficiency, carrier density vs. current density relationship, phase space filling (PSF), quantum confined stark effect (QCSE), and Coulomb enhancement. An optimal QW thickness of around 2.7 nm in these InGaN/GaN LEDs was determined for quantum wells having constant In composition. Despite better control of deep-level defects and lower carrier density at a given current density, LEDs with thin QWs still suffer from an imbalance of enhancement effects on the radiative and intrinsic Auger-Meitner recombination coefficients. The imbalance of enhancement effects results in a decline in internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and radiative efficiency with decreasing QW thickness at low current density in LEDs with QW thicknesses below 2.7 nm. We also investigate how LED modulation bandwidth varies with quantum well thickness, identifying the key trends and their implications for device performance.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Elastic Lattices with $\mathcal{PT}$-Symmetry and Time Modulation: From Perfect Trapping to the Wave Boomerang Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave motion is fundamentally constrained by the dispersion properties of the medium, often making it challenging -- or even impossible -- to guide wave packets along desired trajectories, particularly when wave inversion is required. The paper illustrates how one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian elastic lattices with time-varying non-local feedback interactions offer unprecedented wave guidance. By relaxing the constraint of Hermiticity while preserving $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry of the nonlocal interactions, it is herein built a framework where the dispersion transitions from positive to negative group velocity, passing through an intermediate regime characterized by a perfectly flat band across all momenta. This effect, realized within the unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase, is further enhanced by the time modulation of lattice parameters, thereby unlocking functionalities such as perfect trapping, where a wave packet is intentionally stopped, and the wave boomerang effect, where the wave packet is reversed or guided back to its initial position. The framework presented in this paper unlocks opportunities that extend beyond wave guidance, including information processing through dispersion engineering in elastic media.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Massless Excitons and Linear Exciton Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons -- elementary excitations formed by bound electron-hole pairs -- govern the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of materials. In two-dimensions (2D), excitons are theoretically predicted to have a linear energy-momentum relation with a non-analytic discontinuity in the long wavelength limit, mimicking the dispersion of a photon. This results in an exciton that behaves like a massless particle, despite the fact that it is a composite boson composed of massive constituents. However, experimental observation of massless excitons has remained elusive. In this work, we unambiguously experimentally observe the predicted linear exciton dispersion in freestanding monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental result is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction based on ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Additionally, we identify the lowest dipole-allowed transition in monolayer hBN to be at 6.6 eV, illuminating a long-standing debate about the band gap of monolayer hBN. These findings provide critical insights into 2D excitonic physics and open new avenues for exciton-mediated superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Performance and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells with Ag-Cu-Zn Alloy Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though the common metal electrode-based perovskite solar cells have achieved a power conversion efficiency of &gt;25%, they also play a crucial role in accelerating the degradation of the cells. In this study, we investigated phase transition engineering in Ag electrodes via Cu and Zn alloying, transforming from a cubic to a tetragonal phase. These alloyed electrodes are then thermally deposited as back electrodes in perovskite solar cells. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the pure Ag and Ag-Cu-Zn alloys deposited atop a hole-transport layer for use in Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3-based solar cells. Our findings reveal that solar cells developed with pure Ag electrodes demonstrate a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.71%, characterized by a fill factor (FF) of 74.8%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.08 V, and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.17 mA/cm2. Conversely, solar cells fabricated with optimized Ag0.875Cu0.120Zn0.005 electrodes exhibit enhanced performance metrics, with an FF of 72.5%, VOC of 1.12 V, and JSC of 23.39 mA/cm2, culminating in an elevated PCE of 19.02%. Moreover, this electrode demonstrates remarkable durability, sustaining operational integrity for 460 hours for the PSCs stored in the N2 glove box, in contrast to the 320 hours for cells with Ag electrodes. The Ag-Cu-Zn alloys exhibited high resistance to corrosion and good adhesion on the hole-transport material layer compared to a layer of Ag. These advancements may lead to the realization of cost-effective, durable, and efficient solar energy conversion systems.</description>

      <title>A chip-based optoelectronic-oscillator frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microresonator-based Kerr frequency combs ("Kerr microcombs") constitute chip-scale frequency combs of broad spectral bandwidth and repetition rate ranging from gigahertz to terahertz. An appealing application exploiting microcombs' coherence and large repetition rate is microwave and millimeter-wave generation. Latest endeavor applying two-point optical frequency division (OFD) on photonic-chip-based microcombs has created microwaves with exceptionally low phase noise. Nevertheless, microcomb-based OFD still requires extensive active locking, additional lasers, and external RF or microwave sources, as well as sophisticated initiation. Here we demonstrate a simple and entirely passive (no active locking) architecture, which incorporates an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) and symphonizes a coherent microcomb and a low-noise microwave spontaneously. Our OEO microcomb leverages state-of-the-art integrated chip devices including a high-power DFB laser, a broadband silicon Mach-Zehnder modulator, an ultralow-loss silicon nitride microresonator, and a high-speed photodetector. Each can be manufactured in large volume with low cost and high yield using established CMOS and III-V foundries. Our system synergizes a microcomb of 10.7 GHz repetition rate and an X-band microwave with phase noise of $-$97/$-$126/$-$130 dBc/Hz at 1/10/100 kHz Fourier frequency offset, yet does not demand active locking, additional lasers, and external RF or microwave sources. With potential to be fully integrated, our OEO microcomb can become an invaluable technology and building block for microwave photonics, radio-over-fiber, and optical communication.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Heterogeneous Melting of Metals under Extreme Non-equilibrium States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme electron-ion nonequilibrium states created by ultrafast laser excitation challenge conventional melting paradigms. Through neural network-enhanced multiscale simulations of tungsten and gold nanofilms, we identify electronic pressure relaxation as a critical driver of heterogeneous phase transformations. Subpicosecond uniaxial expansion generates density decrease that enable surface-initiated melting far below equilibrium melting temperatures. This ultrafast heterogeneous melting propagates at 2500 m/s-tenfold faster than thermal mechanisms-with characteristic stationary diffraction peak splitting distinguishing it from thermal expansion dynamics. While tungsten shows pressure-driven solid-solid transitions, gold exhibits complete room-temperature amorphization under electronic stress. These results establish hot-electron-mediated lattice destabilization as a universal pathway for laser-induced structural transformations, providing new insights for interpreting time-resolved experiments and controlling laser-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Raman Signatures of Single Point Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Quantum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects in solid-state quantum systems are vital for enabling single-photon emission at specific wavelengths, making their precise identification essential for advancing applications in quantum technologies. However, pinpointing the microscopic origins of these defects remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Raman spectroscopy as a robust strategy for defect identification. Using density functional theory, we systematically characterize the Raman signatures of 100 defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spanning periodic groups III to VI, encompassing around 30,000 phonon modes. Our findings reveal that the local atomic environment plays a pivotal role in shaping the Raman lineshape, enabling the narrowing of potential defect candidates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can differentiate defects based on their spin and charge states as well as strain-induced variations, implying the versatility of this approach. Therefore, this study not only provides a comprehensive theoretical database of Raman spectra for hBN defects but also establishes a novel experiment framework for using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to identify point defects. More broadly, our approach offers a universal method for defect identification in any quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Third-order Orbital Corner State and its Realization in Acoustic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three dimensional (3D) third-order topological insulators (TIs) have zero-dimensional (0D) corner states, which are three dimensions lower than bulk. Here we investigate the third-order TIs on breathing pyrochlore lattices with p-orbital freedom. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is derived for the p-orbital model, in which we find that the two orthogonal ${\pi}$-type (transverse) hoppings are the key to open a band gap and obtain higher-order topological corner states. We introduce the Z4 berry phase to characterize the bulk topology and analysis the phase diagram. The corner states, demonstrated in a finite structure of a regular tetrahedron, exhibit rich 3D orbital configurations. Furthermore, we design an acoustic system to introduce the necessary ${\pi}$-type hopping and successfully observe the orbital corner states. Our work extends topological orbital corner states to third-order, which enriches the contents of orbital physics and may lead to applications in novel topological acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Probe position determination with multichannel I-V measurements in a two-dimensional sheet$\colon$ Computational method and mathematical analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomically thin films and surfaces exhibit many distinctive two-dimensional electronic properties that are absent in bulk crystals. In situ microscale multi-probe measurements have been utilized as an effective method to identify the electrical conductivity of such thin films and surfaces. Precise determination of multi-probe positions is crucial for accurate characterization of the conductance. However, traditional methods that use microscopes for determining multi-probe positions often impose significant constraints on experimental setups. In some cases, installing a microscope is not even feasible. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel method to determine probe positions using electrical signals from the probes. This method enables precise determination of probe positions using a reference sheet and reference probes, even at low or high temperatures and under ultra-high vacuum or high-pressure conditions. The proposed method simplifies the integration of microscale multi-probe measurement systems into various devices, thereby advancing research on thin films and surfaces.</description>

      <title>Entropy Scaling for Diffusion Coefficients in Fluid Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropy scaling is a powerful technique that has been used for predicting transport properties of pure components over a wide range of states. However, modeling mixture diffusion coefficients by entropy scaling is an unresolved task. We tackle this issue and present an entropy scaling framework for predicting mixture self-diffusion coefficients as well as mutual diffusion coefficients in a thermodynamically consistent way. The predictions of the mixture diffusion coefficients are made based on information on the self-diffusion coefficients of the pure components and the infinite-dilution diffusion coefficients. This is accomplished using information on the entropy of the mixture, which is taken here from molecular-based equations of state. Examples for the application of the entropy scaling framework for the prediction of diffusion coefficients in mixtures illustrate its performance. It enables predictions over a wide range of temperatures and pressures including gaseous, liquid, supercritical, and metastable states - also for strongly non-ideal mixtures.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Techniques for Optimal Control of Reconfigurable Battery Systems: System Modeling and Feasible Search Space Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable battery systems (RBSs) are emerging as a promising solution to improving fault tolerance, charge and thermal balance, energy delivery, etc. To optimize these performance metrics of RBSs, high-dimensional nonlinear integer programming problems need to be formulated and solved. To accomplish this, it is necessary to address several critical challenges stemming from nonlinear battery characteristics, discrete switch states, dynamic system configurations, as well as the curse of dimensionality inherent in large-scale RBSs. Thus, we propose a unified modeling framework to accommodate various possible configurations of an RBS and even to cover different RBS designs and their hybrid combinations, enabling the problem formulation for the RBS optimal control and facilitating the RBS topology design.Further, to solve the formulated RBS optimal control problems, the search space is narrowed to encompass only the feasible solutions, thereby ensuring safe battery connections while substantially curtailing search efforts. These proposed techniques, focusing on unifying the system modeling and narrowing the search space, lay a solid foundation for effectively formulating and efficiently solving RBS optimal control problems. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed techniques are demonstrated by both simulation and experimental tests.</description>
