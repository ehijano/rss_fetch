      <title>Superconductivity suppression and bilayer decoupling in Pr substituted YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping, implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in Shapiro steps in an asymmetric SQUID with a superconducting nanobridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect in an asymmetric SQUID consisting of a sinusoidal Josephson junction formed by a Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se flake and a superconducting Nb nanobridge with a linear and multivalued current-phase relation (CPR). Current-voltage characteristics were measured both in the absence (dc regime) and presence (ac regime) of external microwave irradiation. Our dc measurements reveal only weak critical current asymmetry (i.e. weak Josephson diode effect), while confirming the multivalued behavior of the SQUID. At the same time, the key finding of this work is the observation of strong Shapiro step asymmetry (concerning the dc current direction) in the ac regime at finite magnetic flux. This peculiarity oscillates as a function of magnetic field with the SQUID's periodicity and varies non-monotonically with the increase in microwave power. Our theoretical model shows that the pronounced Shapiro step asymmetry, despite the small diode effect in critical current, arises from the interplay between the sinusoidal and multivalued CPRs of the junctions.</description>

      <title>Growth and microwave properties of FeSe thin films and comparison with Fe(Se,Te)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have grown $\sim$100 nm thick pristine FeSe films by pulsed laser deposition. The films were structurally characterized with X-ray diffraction and their surface morphology checked through atomic force microscopy. Microwave measurements, performed with a dielectric loaded resonator tuned at the frequency of 8 GHz, allowed the characterization of the samples surface resistance, in view of potential applications in microwave haloscopes for dark matter search. Here, we report the comparison of the microwave properties of FeSe with Fe(Se,Te) thin films, as the temperature is swept from 4 K to 20 K. By applying a constant static magnetic field of 12 T, it was also possible to discern the magnetic field resilience of the two samples. FeSe showed a larger critical temperature drift as the field is applied, while the Fe(Se,Te) response broadens remarkably less. A preliminary analysis of vortex pinning shows margins for optimizing pinning in FeSe.</description>

      <title>Microwave surface resistance of Tl-1223 films in a dc magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first preliminary surface impedance measurements on Tl-1223 films in dc magnetic fields, in view of potential applications for the next generation Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) at CERN. The Tl-1223 samples were produced through laser ablation, with nominal thickness of 1 {\mu}m and grown on a thick LaAl2O3 substrate. The presence of Tl-1212 phase identified by XRD and BSE microscopy, could be avoided by changing the oxygen partial pressure during heat treatment. The high-frequency transport properties of the samples were characterized using microwave resonant devices, at fixed frequencies of 14.9 GHz, 24.2 GHz and 26.7 GHz, in the temperature range 40 K to 140 K. An external applied static magnetic field up to 12 T was applied. Samples from subsequent batches exhibited huge improvements in the microwave properties, confirming the progress in the deposition technique.</description>

      <title>Interband-Pairing-Boosted Supercurrent Diode Effect in Multiband Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil a mechanism that enables a robust supercurrent diode effect in Josephson junctions based on multiband superconductors. We predict that interband pairing can significantly amplifies this effect, even under weak spin-orbit coupling while intraband pairing alone would render it negligible. To illustrate this, we examine monolayer FeSe/STO, a system where recent experiments suggest interband pairing in either a nodeless $d$-wave or $\eta$ pairing state. Using experimentally derived parameters, we predict that FeSe/STO can serve as a high-temperature platform for realizing a substantial supercurrent diode effect, with efficiencies reaching up to $30\%$ for $d$-wave pairing and $12\%$ for $\eta$ pairing. These results demonstrate that measuring the supercurrent diode effect can provides a powerful probe of the pairing symmetry in monolayer FeSe/STO, offering critical insights into its superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Gap Engineering in Tantalum-Alloy-Based Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing tantalum (Ta) in superconducting circuits has led to significant improvements, such as high qubit lifetimes and quality factors in both qubits and resonators, underscoring the importance of material optimization in quantum device performance. In this work, we explore superconducting gap engineering in Ta-based devices as a strategy to expand the range of viable host materials. By alloying 20 atomic percent hafnium (Hf) into Ta thin films, we achieve a superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of 6.09~K, as measured by DC transport, reflecting an increased superconducting gap. We systematically vary deposition conditions to control film orientation and transport properties of the Ta-Hf alloy films. The enhancement in $T_c$ is further confirmed by microwave measurements at millikelvin temperatures. Despite the 40\% increase in $T_c$ relative to pure Ta, the loss contributions from two-level systems (TLS) and quasiparticles (QPs) remain unchanged in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the potential of material engineering to improve superconducting circuit performance and motivate further exploration of engineered alloys for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Investigating the performance of RPM JTWPAs by optimizing LC-resonator elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant phase-matched Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (RPM JTWPAs) play a key role in quantum computing and quantum information applications due to their low-noise, broadband amplification, and quadrature squeezing capabilities. This research focuses on optimizing RPM JTWPAs through numerical optimization of parametrized resonator elements to maximize gain, bandwidth and quadrature squeezing. Our results show that optimized resonators can increase the maximum gain and squeezing by more than 5 dB in the ideal noiseless case. However, introducing the effects of loss through a lumped-element model reveals that gain saturates with increasing loss, while squeezing modes degrade rapidly, regardless of resonator optimization. These results highlight the potential of resonator design to significantly improve amplifier performance, as well as the challenges posed by current fabrication technologies and inherent losses.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fluctuations and anisotropy in UTe2: a multi-orbital study based on GGA+U and RPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pressure-induced changes in the magnetic and superconducting properties of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 have attracted considerable interest, underscoring the need for microscopic theoretical insight. In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $\chi^b &gt; \chi^a &gt; \chi^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $\chi^a &gt; \chi^c &gt; \chi^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect with Andreev and Majorana bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductor-semiconductor hybrids are useful for realizing the Josephson diode effect, where nonreciprocity in the supercurrents occurs due to the interplay of the Josephson effect and applied magnetic fields. These junctions can host Andreev and Majorana states with the same ingredients, though their interplay with the Josephson diode effect is unclear. In this work, we consider short Josephson junctions based on superconductor-semiconductor systems under homogeneous Zeeman fields and investigate the Josephson diode effect in the presence of Andreev and Majorana states. Under generic conditions, the Zeeman field component parallel to the spin-orbit axis promotes an asymmetric low-energy spectrum as a function of the superconducting phase, which persists in the trivial and topological phases hosting Andreev and Majorana bound states, respectively. Interestingly, this asymmetry creates supercurrents that are not odd functions of the phase difference, leading to a nonreciprocal behaviour and the Josephson diode effect. We show that the Josephson diode effect is particularly promoted under the presence of both zero-energy Andreev and Majorana bound states, revealing that Josephson diodes can be realized in the trivial and topological phases of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. We then demonstrate that the Zeeman field evolution of the diode's efficiencies can map the topological phase transition and the formation of Majorana bound states via an oscillatory behavior that becomes more visible in long superconductors. While Josephson diodes generally exist in the trivial and topological phases of Josephson junctions, we discover that in the tunneling regime only a Josephson diode effect in the topological phase remains due to the finite contribution of Majorana bound states. Our findings clarify the Josephson diode effect and aid in realizing Majorana-only Josephson diodes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous proximity effect under Andreev and Majorana bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal metal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba semiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial helical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase with Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced pair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their behavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and diffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We find that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states and spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute primarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the zero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the superconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the topological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is short. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the topological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet correlations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results highlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder, contingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator distinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound states.</description>
