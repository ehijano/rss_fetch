      <title>Critical non-local spatial branching processes with infinite variance conditioned on survival</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the setting of either a general non-local branching particle process or a general non-local superprocess. Under the assumption that the mean semigroup has a Perron-Frobenious type behaviour in combination with a regularly varying assumption on the reproductive point process, which permits infinite second moments, we consider sufficient conditions that ensure limiting distributional stability when conditioned on survival at criticality.
  We offer two main results. Under the aforesaid conditions, our first main contribution establishes the polynomial decay in time of the survival probability in the spirit of a classical Kolmogorov limit. The second main contribution pertains to the stability, when conditioning on survival, in the spirit of a Yaglom limit. In both cases our proofs work equally well for the analogous setting of non-local superprocesses with non-local branching.
  Our results complete a series of articles for various families of non spatial branching processes from the 1950s-1970s as well complementing a recent result of this type for spatial branching processes of Ren, Song and Sun (2020) The generality of our results improve on older work of Hering and Hoppe (1981) and Asmussen and Hering (1983) who dealt with a similar context for branching particle systems, as well as providing a general framework for non-local superprocesses.</description>

      <title>An upper bound of the lower tail of the mass of balls under the critical $2d$ stochastic heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical two-dimensional stochastic heat flow $\mathscr{Z}_t^{\vartheta}$, recently constructed as the scaling limit of directed polymers in a random environment and as the limit of the solution to a mollified stochastic heat equation. Focusing on the mass of balls $\mathscr{Z}_t^{\vartheta}(B_r(0),B_r(a))$ ($a\in \mathbb{R}^2$, $r&gt;0$), we establish an upper bound on its lower tail. As a consequence, we prove the integrability of the logarithm of $\mathscr{Z}_t^{\vartheta}(B_r(0),B_r(a))$ and its strict positivity. These results provide partial answers to open questions concerning the local behavior of $\mathscr{Z}_t^\vartheta$.</description>

      <title>Global fluctuations for standard Young tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Young generating function for a probability measure on integer partitions. We use this object to characterize probability distributions over integer partitions satisfying a law of large numbers and those that satisfy a central limit theorem. We further establish a multilevel central limit theorem, which enables the study of random standard Young tableaux. As applications of these results, we describe the fluctuations of height functions associated with (i) the Plancherel growth process, (ii) random standard Young tableaux of fixed shape, and (iii) probability distributions induced by extreme characters of the infinite symmetric group $S_\infty$. In all cases, we identify the limiting fluctuations as a conditioned Gaussian Free Field.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-order log-concave sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the zeroth-order query complexity of log-concave sampling, specifically uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles. We propose a simple variant of the proximal sampler that achieves the query complexity with matched R\'enyi orders between the initial warmness and output guarantee. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $q\geq2$, the sampler, initialized at $\pi_{0}$, outputs a sample whose law is $\varepsilon$-close in $q$-R\'enyi divergence to $\pi$, the uniform distribution over a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, using $\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ membership queries, where $M_{q}=\lVert\text{d}\pi_{0}/\text{d}\pi\rVert_{L^{q}(\pi)}$.
  We further introduce a simple annealing scheme that produces a warm start in $q$-R\'enyi divergence (i.e., $M_{q}=O(1)$) using $\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$ queries, where $R^{2}=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[|\cdot|^{2}]$. This interpolates between known complexities for warm-start generation in total variation and R\'enyi-infinity divergence. To relay a R\'enyi warmness across the annealing scheme, we establish hypercontractivity under simultaneous heat flow and translate it into an improved mixing guarantee for the proximal sampler under a logarithmic Sobolev inequality. These results extend naturally to general log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles, incurring additional quadratic queries.</description>

      <title>A Jarque-Bera test for skew normal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The skew normal law has been introduced in Azzalin (1985) as an alternative to adjusting asymmetric data that share important patterns with the normal law. It has been extensively studied. However, there is so much to do in order to catch the diversity and the richness of the investigation of its normal counterpart. The General Jarque-Berra Test (GJBT) has been devised by Lo et al. (2015), Da et al. (2023) for arbitrary laws with at least finite first eight moments, as a generalization of the Jarque-Bera (1987) test that was specially set up for normal data. Here, we particularize it to skew normal data. When particularized in the skew normal law, this test is proven to be extremely powerful in detecting the true model for any $\alpha\neq 0$ and rejected the normal law ($\alpha=0$) whatever be the size of the data. We introduced the use of the samples duplication method to reach a high level of efficiency for the test.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of $q$-deformed unitary ensembles with the Al-Salam--Carlitz weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $q$-deformed random unitary ensembles associated with the weight function of the Al-Salam--Carlitz orthogonal polynomials, indexed by a parameter $a &lt; 0$. In the special case $a = -1$, the model reduces to the $q$-deformed Gaussian unitary ensemble. Employing the Flajolet--Viennot theory together with the combinatorics of matchings, we derive an explicit positive-sum expression for the spectral moments. In the double-scaling regime $q = e^{-\lambda/N}$, where $N$ denotes the ensemble size and $\lambda &gt; 0$ is fixed, we derive the first two terms in the large-$N$ expansion of the spectral moments. As a consequence, we obtain a closed-form expression for the limiting spectral density. Notably, this density exhibits two successive phase transitions as $\lambda$ increases, characterised by a reduction in the number of soft edges from two, to one, and eventually to none. Furthermore, we show that the limiting density coincides with the limiting zero distribution of the Al-Salam--Carlitz orthogonal polynomials under the same scaling.</description>

      <title>Pathwise analysis of log-optimal portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the theory of c\`adl\`ag rough paths, we develop a pathwise approach to analyze stability and approximation properties of portfolios along individual price trajectories generated by standard models of financial markets. As a prototypical example from portfolio theory, we study the log-optimal portfolio in a classical investment-consumption optimization problem on a frictionless financial market modelled by an It\^o diffusion process. We identify a fully deterministic framework that enables a pathwise construction of the log-optimal portfolio, for which we then establish pathwise stability estimates with respect to the underlying model parameters. We also derive pathwise error estimates arising from the time-discretization of the log-optimal portfolio and its associated capital process.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation with the 2D Navier-Stokes equations: Optimal Gaussian asymptotics for the posterior measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A functional Bernstein - von Mises theorem is proved for posterior measures arising in a data assimilation problem with the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation where a Gaussian process prior is assigned to the initial condition of the system. The posterior measure, which provides the update in the space of all trajectories arising from a discrete sample of the (deterministic) dynamics, is shown to be approximated by a Gaussian random vector field arising from the solution to a linear parabolic PDE with Gaussian initial condition. The approximation holds in the strong sense of the supremum norm on the regression functions, showing that predicting future states of Navier-Stokes systems admits $1/\sqrt N$-consistent estimators even for commonly used nonparametric models. Consequences for coverage of credible bands and uncertainty quantification are discussed. A local asymptotic minimax theorem is derived that describes the lower bound for estimating the state of the nonlinear system, which is shown to be attained by the Bayesian data assimilation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Consistency of tug-of-war type operators on random data clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a tug-of-war type operator on geometric graphs and its associated Dirichlet problem on a random data cloud.
  Specifically, we analyze the convergence of the value functions as the number of data points increases and the step size of the game shrinks. This analysis reveals the connection between our tug-of-war type operator and the corresponding model problem.
  A key ingredient in establishing this result is the consistency of the operator.</description>

      <title>How weak are weak factors? Uniform inference for signal strength in signal plus noise models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper analyzes four classical signal-plus-noise models: the factor model, spiked sample covariance matrices, the sum of a Wigner matrix and a low-rank perturbation, and canonical correlation analysis with low-rank dependencies. The objective is to construct confidence intervals for the signal strength that are uniformly valid across all regimes - strong, weak, and critical signals. We demonstrate that traditional Gaussian approximations fail in the critical regime. Instead, we introduce a universal transitional distribution that enables valid inference across the entire spectrum of signal strengths. The approach is illustrated through applications in macroeconomics and finance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-posedness for SDEs with singularity in both space and distribution variables is derived, where the interacting drift term is bounded and Lipschitz continuous under total variation distance and the diffusion term is allowed to be Lipschitz continuous under $L^\eta$($\eta\in(0,1]$)-Wasserstein distance in the distribution variable. When the diffusion term is Lipschitz continuous under $L^k$-Wasserstein distance for some $k\geq 1$, the regularity estimate $$\|P_t^\ast\gamma^1-P_t^\ast\gamma^2\|_{var}\leq ct^{-\frac{1}{2}}\W_{k}(\gamma^1,\gamma^2),\ \ t\in(0,T]$$ is established. This improves the results in \cite[Theorem 1.3]{HRWJDE}.</description>

Abstract: We study a continuous time Mutually Catalytic Branching model on the $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. The model describes the behavior of two different populations of particles, performing random walk on the lattice in the presence of branching, that is, each particle dies at a certain rate and is replaced by a random number of offspring. The branching rate of a particle in one population is proportional to the number of particles of another population at the same site. We study the long time behavior for this model, in particular, coexistence and non-coexistence of two populations in the long run. Finally, we construct a sequence of renormalized processes and use duality techniques to investigate its limiting behavior.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization of the three-dimensional polymer measure via the Dirichlet form method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a diffusion process whose invariant measure is the three dimensional polymer measure $\nu_\lambda$ for all $\lambda&gt;0$. We follow in part a previous incomplete unpublished work of the first named author with M. R\"ockner and X.Y. Zhou. For the construction of $\nu_\lambda$ we rely on previous work by J. Westwater, E. Bolthausen and X.Y. Zhou. Using $\nu_\lambda$, the diffusion is constructed by means of the theory of Dirichlet forms on infinite-dimensional state spaces. The closability of the appropriate pre-Dirichlet form which is of gradient type is proven, by using a general closability result in [AR89a]. This result does not require an integration by parts formula (which does not even hold for the two-dimensional polymer measure $\nu_\lambda$) but requires the quasi-invariance of $\nu_\lambda$ along a basis of vectors in the classical Cameron-Martin space such that the Radon-Nikodym derivatives have versions which form a continuous process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A relationship between two sided discounted singular control problems and Dynkin games is established for real valued L\'evy processes. In addition, the solution of a two-sided ergodic singular control problem is obtained as the limit of the corresponding solution of the discounted one. With these results, we conclude that the optimal controls within the class of cadlag strategies can be in fact found in the class of reflecting barriers controls for both problems, and solved through some deterministic equations. To illustrate the results, three examples are given: compound Poisson processes with two-sided exponential jumps with and without Gaussian component, and stable processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle (J. Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a lazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this random walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all $3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of the comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024). We also give the complete spectrum of the alternating group graph, thus answering a question of Huang and Huang (J. Algebraic Combin., 2019).</description>

      <title>Extremal Ising Gibbs States on Lobachevsky lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges, the sparseness being measured in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the graph. This result is implied by an extension of the article [5] on regular trees to non-amenable graphs. We moreover argue how we can deduce the extremality of an uncountable subset of the Series--Sinai states [23] at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Rates of Convergence for Hermitian Unitary Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides microscopic rates of convergence (ROC) with respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for the eigenvalue determinantal point processes (DPPs) from the three major Hermitian unitary ensembles, the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), the Laguerre Unitary Ensemble (LUE), and the Jacobi Unitary Ensemble (JUE) to their limiting point processes. We prove ROCs for the bulk of the GUE spectrum, the hard edge of the LUE spectrum, and the soft edges of the GUE, LUE, and JUE spectrums. These results are called microscopic because we are able to directly compare the point counts between the converging and limit DPPs, the most refined type of information possible in this situation. We are able to achieve these results by controlling the trace class norm of the integral operators determined by the DPP kernels.</description>

      <title>On the minimal integral energy of majorants of the Wiener process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior (over long time intervals) of the minimal integral energy \[ |h|_T^\psi = \int_0^T \psi(h^\prime(t)) \, \mathrm{d}t \] of majorants of the Wiener process $ W(\cdot) $ satisfying the constraints $ h(0) = r $, $ h(t) \geq W(t) $ for $ 0 \leq t \leq T $. The results significantly generalize previous asymptotic estimates obtained for the case of kinetic energy $ \psi(u) = u^2 $, revealing that this case, where the minimal energy grows logarithmically, is a critical one, lying between two different asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <title>On the Approximation of Stationary Processes using the ARMA Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit an old problem related to Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, on quantifying and bounding the approximation error between a true stationary process $X_t$ and an ARMA model $Y_t$. We take the transfer function representation of an ARMA model and show that the associated $L^{\infty}$ norm provides a valid alternate norm that controls the $L^2$ norm and has structural properties comparable to the cepstral norm. We show that a certain subspace of stationary processes, which includes ARMA models, forms a Banach algebra under the $L^{\infty}$ norm that respects the group structure of $H^{\infty}$ transfer functions. The natural definition of invertibility in this algebra is consistent with the original definition of ARMA invertibility, and generalizes better to non-ARMA processes than Wiener's $\ell^1$ condition. Finally, we calculate some explicit approximation bounds in the simpler context of continuous transfer functions, and critique some heuristic ideas on Pad\'e approximations and parsimonious models.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Propagation of Chaos for 2D Viscous Vortex Model with General Circulations on the Whole Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive quantitative propagation of chaos in the sense of relative entropy for the 2D viscous vortex model with general circulations, approximating the vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation on the whole Euclidean space, which is an extension of the previous works \cite{fournier2014propagation,jabin2018quantitative}. We improve our previous results in \cite{feng2023quantitative} to the more general case that the vorticity may change sign, allowing the circulations to be in different orientations. We also extend the results of \cite{wang2024sharp} to the whole space to obtain the sharp local propagation of chaos in the high viscosity regime. Both results of convergence rates are global-in-time on any finite time horizon and optimal among existing literature, thanks to the sharp logarithmic growth estimates and a new ODE hierarchy and iterated integral estimates.</description>

      <title>Dual-Domain Exponent of Maximum Mutual Information Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a dual domain derivation of the error exponent of maximum mutual information (MMI) decoding with constant composition codes, showing it coincides with that of maximum likelihood decoding for discrete memoryless channels. The analysis is further extended to joint source-channel coding, demonstrating that the generalized MMI decoder achieves the same random coding error exponent as the maximum a posteriori decoder.</description>

      <title>Sampling the space of solutions of an artificial neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weight space of an artificial neural network can be systematically explored using tools from statistical mechanics. We employ a combination of a hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm which performs long exploration steps, a ratchet-based algorithm to investigate connectivity paths, and coupled replica models simulations to study subdominant flat regions. Our analysis focuses on one hidden layer networks and spans a range of energy levels and constrained density regimes. Near the interpolation threshold, the low-energy manifold shows a spiky topology. In the overparameterized regime, however, the low-energy manifold becomes entirely flat, forming an extended complex structure that is easy to sample. These numerical results are supported by an analytical study of the training error landscape, and we show numerically that the qualitative features of the loss landscape are robust across different data structures.
  Our study aims to provide new methodological insights for developing scalable methods for large networks.</description>

      <title>Towards Markov-State Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments, in particular on biological systems, typically probe lower-dimensional observables which are projections of high-dimensional dynamics. In order to infer consistent models capturing the relevant dynamics of the system, it is important to detect and account for the memory in the dynamics. We develop a method to infer the presence of hidden states and transition pathways based on observable transition probabilities conditioned on history sequences for projected (i.e. observed) dynamics of Markov processes. Histograms conditioned on histories reveal information on the transition probabilities of hidden paths locally between any specific pair of observed states. The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary distribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which reflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed transition decorrelate in path space. This motivates the notion of "weak Markov order" and provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a holography-like fashion. The method can be used to test for the local Markov property of observables. The information extracted is also helpful in inferring relevant hidden transitions which are not captured by a Markov-state model.</description>
