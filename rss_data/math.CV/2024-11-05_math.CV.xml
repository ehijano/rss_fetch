      <title>Improved Bohr-type Inequalities for the Cesaro Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the sharp improved versions of Bohr-type inequalities for the Ces\'aro operator acting on the class of bounded analytic functions defined on the unit disk $\D=\left\{z\in\C:\left|z\right|&lt;1\right\}$. In order to achieve these results, we utilize the principle of substituting the initial coefficients of the majorant series with the absolute values of the Ces\'aro operator associated with a bounded analytic function defined on $\D$ and its derivative, as well as for the Schwarz function.</description>

      <title>On existence questions for the functional equations $f^8+g^8+h^8=1$ and $f^6+g^6+h^6=1$</title>

Abstract: In 1985, W.K.Hayman (Bayer. Akad. Wiss. Math.-Natur. Kl. Sitzungsber, 1984(1985), 1-13.) proved that there do not exist non-constant meromorphic functions $f,$ $g$ and $h$ satisfying the functional equation $f^n+g^n+h^n=1$ for $n\geq 9.$ We prove that there do not exist non-constant meromorphic solutions $f,$ $g,$ $h$ satisfying the functional equation $f^8+g^8+h^8=1.$ In 1971, N. Toda (T\^{o}hoku Math. J. 23(1971), no. 2, 289-299.) proved that there do not exist non-constant entire functions $f,$ $g,$ $h$ satisfying $f^n+g^n+h^n=1$ for $n\geq 7.$ We prove that there do not exist non-constant entire functions $f,$ $g,$ $h$ satisfying the functional equation $f^6+g^6+h^6=1.$ Our results answer questions of G. G. Gundersen.</description>

      <title>Normality criterion for a family of holomorphic curves that partially share wandering hyperplanes with their derivatives, and holomorphic functions lifted to curves in $P^2(\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize a result of Ye, Pang and Yang[12] on the normality of a family of holomorphic curves in $P^N(\mathbb{C})$. Further we obtain a normality criterion for family of meromorphic functions that partially share wandering holomorphic functions with their derivatives. We also devise a tractable representation of complex valued holomorphic functions from D as functions from D to $P^2(\mathbb{C})$ obtain a normality criterion that leads to a counterexample to the converse of Bloch's principle.</description>

      <title>Operator valued analogues of multidimensional refined Bohr's inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ denote the Banach algebra of all bounded linear operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H}$. In this paper, we first establish several sharply refined versions of Bohr's inequality analogues with operator valued functions in the class $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{D}, \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}))$ of bounded analytic functions from the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ to $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ with $\sup_{|z|&lt;1}\Vert f(z)\leq 1$ by utilizing a certain power of the function's norm. Additionally, we establish several multidimensional analogues of refined Bohr's inequalities by using operator valued functions in the complete circular domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$. All of the results are sharp.</description>

      <title>Generalized Bohr inequalities for K-quasiconformal harmonic mappings and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Bohr theorem and its subsequent generalizations have become active areas of research, with investigations conducted in numerous function spaces. Let $\{\psi_n(r)\}_{n=0}^\infty$ be a sequence of non-negative continuous functions defined on $[0,1)$ such that the series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \psi_n(r)$ converges locally uniformly on the interval $[0, 1)$. The main objective of this paper is to establish several sharp versions of generalized Bohr inequalities for the class of $K$-quasiconformal sense-preserving harmonic mappings on the unit disk $\D := \{z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| &lt; 1\}$. To achieve these, we employ the sequence of functions $\{\psi_n(r)\}_{n=0}^\infty$ in the majorant series rather than the conventional dependence on the basis sequence $\{r^n\}_{n=0}^\infty$. As applications, we derive a number of previously published results as well as a number of sharply improved and refined Bohr inequalities for harmonic mappings in $\D$. Moreover, we obtain a convolution counterpart of the Bohr theorem for harmonic mapping within the context of the Gaussian hypergeometric function</description>

      <title>H\"ormander's Inequality and Point Evaluations in de Branges Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be an entire function of finite exponential type less than or equal to $\sigma$ which is bounded by $1$ on the real axis and satisfies $f(0) = 1$. Under these assumptions H\"ormander showed that $f$ cannot decay faster than $\cos(\sigma x)$ on the interval $(-\pi/\sigma,\pi/\sigma)$. We extend this result to the setting of de Branges spaces with cosine replaced by the real part of the associated Hermite-Biehler function. We apply this result to study the point evaluation functional and associated extremal functions in de Branges spaces (equivalently in model spaces generated by meromorphic inner functions) generalizing some recent results of Brevig, Chirre, Ortega-Cerd\`a, and Seip.</description>

      <title>Two-loop Loewner potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Schramm-Loewner evolution loop measure to pairs of non-intersecting Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere. We also introduce four equivalent definitions for a two-loop Loewner potential: respectively expressing it in terms of normalized Brownian loop measure, zeta-regularized determinants of the Laplacian, an integral formula generalizing universal Liouville action, and Loewner-Kufarev energy of a foliation. Moreover, we prove that the potential is finite if and only if both loops are Weil-Petersson quasicircles, that it is an Onsager-Machlup functional for the two-loop SLE, and a variational formula involving Schwarzian derivatives.
  Addressing the question of minimization of the two-loop Loewner potential, we find that any such minimizers must be pairs of circles. However, the potential is not bounded, diverging to negative infinity as the circles move away from each other and to positive infinity as the circles merge, thus preventing a definition of two-loop Loewner energy for the prospective large deviations theory for the two-loop SLE.
  To remedy the divergence, we study a way of generalizing the two-loop Loewner potential by taking into account how conformal field theory (CFT) partition functions depend on the modulus of the annulus between the loops. This generalization is motivated by the correspondence between SLE and CFT, and it also emerges from the geometry of the real determinant line bundle as introduced by Kontsevich and Suhov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to provide a uniformization procedure for Gromov hyperbolic spaces, which need not be geodesic or proper. We prove that the conformal deformation of a Gromov hyperbolic space is a bounded uniform space. Further, we show that there is a natural quasi-isometry between the Gromov boundary and the metric boundary of the deformed space. Our main results are a generalization of the results of Bonk, Heninonen, and Koskela [Proposition 4.5, Proposition 4.13, Ast\'{e}risque 270 (2001)].</description>

      <title>Records from the S-Matrix Marathon: Tasty Bits of Several Complex Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will cover the basics of several complex variables in 4 lectures: Basic properties of holomorphic functions in several variables, the notion of pseudoconvexity, CR functions and CR geometry, and the $\bar\partial$-problem. The main underlying idea is to connect various characterizations of domains of holomorphy, that is, the natural domains of definition for holomorphic functions. In the process we will connect the function theory on the domain to geometric properties of the boundary, and discuss the relationship between the boundary values and the functions themselves and extension of holomorphic functions from subspaces.
  These notes are based on a series of lectures held during the S-Matrix Marathon workshop at the Institute for Advanced Study on 11-22 March 2024.</description>

      <title>Balayage, equilibrium measure, and Deny's principle of positivity of mass for $\alpha$-Green potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the theory of $g_\alpha$-potentials on a domain $D\subset\mathbb R^n$, $n\geqslant2$, $g_\alpha$ being the $\alpha$-Green kernel associated with the $\alpha$-Riesz kernel $|x-y|^{\alpha-n}$ of order $\alpha\in(0,n)$, $\alpha\leqslant2$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the $g_\alpha$-balayage $\mu^F$ of a positive Radon measure $\mu$ onto a relatively closed set $F\subset D$, we analyze its alternative characterizations, and we provide necessary and/or sufficient conditions for $\mu^F(D)=\mu(D)$ to hold, given in terms of the $\alpha$-harmonic measure of suitable Borel subsets of $\overline{\mathbb R^n}$, the one-point compactification of $\mathbb R^n$. As a by-product, we find necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the existence of the $g_\alpha$-equilibrium measure $\gamma_F$, $\gamma_F$ being understood in an extended sense where $\gamma_F(D)$ might be infinite. We also discover quite a surprising version of Deny's principle of positivity of mass for $g_\alpha$-potentials, thereby significantly improving a previous result by Fuglede and Zorii (Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn. Math., 2018). The results thus obtained are sharp, which is illustrated by means of a number of examples. Some open questions are also posed.</description>

      <title>Spectral set, complete spectral set and dilation for Banach space operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Famous results due to von Neumann, Sz.-Nagy and Arveson assert that the following four statements are equivalent; a Hilbert space operator $T$ is a contraction; the closed unit disk $\overline{\mathbb D}$ is a spectral set for $T$; $T$ can be dilated to a Hilbert space isometry; $\overline{\mathbb D}$ is a complete spectral set for $T$. In this article, we show by counter examples that no two of them are equivalent for Banach space operators. If $\mathcal F_r$ is the family of all Banach space operators having norm less than or equal to $r$ and if $D_R$ denotes the open disk in the complex plane with centre at the origin and radius $R$, then we prove by an application of Bohr's theorem that $\overline{D}_R$ is the minimal spectral set for $\mathcal F_r$ if and only if $r=\frac{R}{3}$. Also, we prove the equivalence of the following two facts: the Bohr radius of $D_R$ is $\frac{R}{3}$ and $\sup \{ r&gt;0\,:\, \overline{D}_R \text{ is a spectral set for } \mathcal F_r \}=\frac{R}{3}$. We found several new characterizations for a Hilbert space in terms of spectral set and complete spectral set for different operators.</description>

      <title>Invariant subspaces for finite index shifts in Hardy spaces and the invariant subspace problem for finite defect operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we characterize (in terms of inner functions and determinants of certain matrices) the closed subspaces of finite direct sums of $H^2(\mathbb D)$ which are invariant under the shift, thus obtaining a concrete Beurling-type theorem for the finite index shift. Using this characterization we prove that none of such subspaces can be maximal but those of codimension one. By the universality of the shifts it follows that if $X$ is a separable Hilbert space, $T:X\to X$ a bounded linear operator such that $\dim \overline{(I-T^\ast T)X}&lt;\infty$ and $M\subset X$ is a closed $T$-invariant space of dimension greater that one, then there exists a closed $T$-invariant subspace $N\neq\{0\}$ such that $N\subsetneq M$.</description>

As an application, we prove that for a plurisubharmonic function $\phi$ and a locally finitely generated ideal sheaf $\mathscr{I}$ on the polydisc $\Delta^{n+m}=\Delta^n\times\Delta^m$, the set of points $w\in\Delta^m$ for which $\mathcal{I}(\phi|_{H_w})_{(o,w)}\subseteq (\mathscr{I}|_{H_w})_{(o,w)}$ is a pluripolar set, where $H_w$ represents the fiber over $w$, and $\mathcal{I}(\phi|_{H_w})$ denotes the multiplier ideal sheaf of $\phi|_{H_w}$ on $H_w$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16208v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to construct a complex analytic family of symmetric projective K3 surfaces through a compactifiable deformation family of complete quasi-projective varieties from $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$. Firstly, for an elliptic curve $C_0$ embedded in $\text{CP}^2$, let $S \cong \text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$ be the blow up of $\text{CP}^2$ at nine points on the image of $C_0$ and $C$ be the strict transform of the image. Then if the normal bundle satisfies the Diophantine condition, a tubular neighborhood of the elliptic curve $C$ can be identified through a toroidal group. Fixing the Diophantine condition, a smooth compactifiable deformation of $S\backslash C$ over a 9-dimensional complex manifold is constructed. What's more, with an ample line bundle fixed on $S$, complete K\"ahler metrics can be constructed on the quasi-projective variety $S\backslash C$. So complete K\"ahler metrics are constructed on each quasi-projective variety fiber of the smooth compactifiable deformation family. Then a complex analytic family of symmetric projective K3 surfaces over a 10-dimensional complex manifold is constructed through the smooth compactifiable deformation family of complete quasi-projective varieties and an analogue deformation family.</description>

      <title>Hartogs type extension theorem for the complement of effective and numerically effective divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17655v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes we generalize the Ohsawa's results on the Hartogs extension phenomenon in the complement of effective divisors in K\"ahler manifolds with semipositive non-flat normal bundle. Namely, we prove that the Hartogs extension phenomenon occurs in the complement of effective and nef divisors with connected supports in K\"ahler manifolds. We use homological algebra methods instead of a construction of the $(n-1)$-convex exhaustion function. Also, the Demailly-Peternell vanishing theorem is a crucial argument for us. Moreover, we obtain geometric characterizations of the Hartogs phenomenon for the complement of basepoint-free divisors.</description>

      <title>On the topological invariance of the algebraic multiplicity of holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address one of the most basic and fundamental problems in the theory of foliations and ODEs, the topological invariance of the algebraic multiplicity of a holomorphic foliation. For instance, we prove an adapted version of A'Campo-L\^e's Theorem for foliations, i.e., the algebraic multiplicity equal to one is a topological invariant in dimension two. This result is further generalized to higher dimensions under mild conditions; as a consequence, we prove that saddle-nodes are topologically invariant. We prove that the algebraic multiplicity is a topological invariant in several classes of foliations that contain, for instance, the generalized curves and the foliations of second type. Additionally, we address a fundamental result by Rosas-Bazan, which states that the existence of a homeomorphism extending through a neighborhood of the exceptional divisor of the first blow-up implies the topological invariance of the algebraic multiplicity. We show that the result holds if the homeomorphism extends locally near a singularity, even if it does not extend over the entire divisor.</description>

      <title>Three radii associated to Schur functions on the polydisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article examines three radii associated to bounded analytic functions on the polydisk: the well-known Bohr radius, the Bohr-Agler radius, and the Schur-Agler radius. We prove explicit upper and lower bounds for the Bohr-Agler radius, an explicit lower bound for the Schur-Agler radius, and an asymptotic upper bound for the Schur-Agler radius. The Bohr-Agler radius obeys the same (known) asymptotic as the Bohr radius while we show the Schur-Agler radius is roughly of the same growth as the Bohr radius. As a corollary, we bound the Bohr radius on the bidisk below by 0.3006. Finally, we improve some estimates of P.G. Dixon on Agler norms of homogeneous polynomials using some modern inequalities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study birational Kleinian groups, i.e.\ groups of birational transformations of complex projective varieties acting in a free, properly discontinuous and cocompact way on an open set of the variety with respect to the usual topology. We obtain a classification in dimension two.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic entropy for harmonic measures on singular holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{F}=(M,\mathscr{L},E)$ be a Brody-hyperbolic singular holomorphic foliation on a compact complex manifold $M$. Suppose that $\mathscr{F}$ has isolated singularities and that its Poincar\'e metric is complete. This is the case for a very large class of singularities, namely, non-degenerate and saddle-nodes in dimension $2$. Let $\mu$ be an ergodic harmonic measure on $\mathscr{F}$. We show that the upper and lower local hyperbolic entropies of $\mu$ are leafwise constant almost everywhere. Moreover, we show that the entropy of $\mu$ is at least $2$.</description>

      <title>A Note On Projective Structures On Compact Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projective structures on topological surfaces support the structure of 2d CFTs with a degree of technical simplification. We propose a complex analytic space $\mathcal{P}_g$ biholomorphic to $T^*_{(1,0)} \mathcal{M}_g$ as a candidate moduli space of the projective structures of the genus $g$ topological surface. Explicit analysis at $g=1$, including of the fibers over the fictitious orbifold loci of $\mathcal{M}_{g=1}$ and of transformations under the modular group, supports this proposal. It also shows that $\mathcal{P}_{g=1}$ naturally resolves the orbifold locus of the affine structure moduli space $\mathcal{A}_{g=1}$ which is related to the Hodge bundle over $\mathcal{M}_{g=1}$. For $g \geq 2$, intricate quotient operations are expected along fibers over the orbifold loci of $\mathcal{M}_g$, whose analysis we leave to future work.
  Physically, the space $\mathcal{P}_g$ represents the bundle of universal, stationary, chiral hydrodynamic flows spatially confined to compact genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rational inner functions are a generalization of finite Blaschke products to several variables. In this article we survey a variety of results about rational inner functions related to interpolation, sums of squares formulas, and boundary behavior. We mostly focus on two variables however in the final section we discuss higher dimensions.</description>
