      <title>Cochlear Wave Propagation and Dynamics in the Human Base and Apex: Model-Based Estimates from Noninvasive Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cochlear wavenumber and impedance are mechanistic variables that encode information regarding how the cochlea works - specifically wave propagation and Organ of Corti dynamics. These mechanistic variables underlie interesting features of cochlear signal processing such as its place-based wavelet analyzers, dispersivity and high-gain. Consequently, it is of interest to estimate these mechanistic variables in various species (particularly humans) and across various locations along the length of the cochlea. In this paper, we develop methods to estimate the mechanistic variables (wavenumber and impedance) from noninvasive response characteristics (such as the quality factors of psychophysical tuning curves) using an existing analytic shortwave single-partition model of the mammalian cochlea. We then apply these methods to estimate human mechanistic variables using reported values for quality factors from psychophysical tuning curves and a location-invariant ratio extrapolated from chinchilla. Our resultant estimates for human wavenumbers and impedances show that the minimum wavelength (which occurs at the peak of the traveling wave) is smaller in base than the apex. The Organ of Corti is stiffness dominated rather than mass dominated, and there is negative effective damping prior to the peak followed by positive effective damping. The effective stiffness, and positive and negative effective damping are greater in the base than the apex. The methods introduced here for estimating mechanistic variables from characteristics of invasive or noninvasive responses enable us to derive such estimates across various species and locations where the responses are describable by sharp filters. In addition to studying cochlear wave propagation and dynamics, the estimation methods developed here are also useful for auditory filter design.</description>

      <title>Comparing fine-grained and coarse-grained object detection for ecology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer vision applications are increasingly popular for wildlife monitoring tasks. While some studies focus on the monitoring of a single species, such as a particular endangered species, others monitor larger functional groups, such as predators. In our study, we used camera trap images collected in north-western New South Wales, Australia, to investigate how model results were affected by combining multiple species in single classes, and whether the addition of negative samples can improve model performance. We found that species that benefited the most from merging into a single class were mainly species that look alike morphologically, i.e. macropods. Whereas species that looked distinctively different gave mixed results when merged, e.g. merging pigs and goats together as non-native large mammals. We also found that adding negative samples improved model performance marginally in most instances, and recommend conducting a more comprehensive study to explore whether the marginal gains were random or consistent. We suggest that practitioners could classify morphologically similar species together as a functional group or higher taxonomic group to draw ecological inferences. Nevertheless, whether to merge classes or not will depend on the ecological question to be explored.</description>

      <title>Permutation invariant multi-output Gaussian Processes for drug combination prediction in cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dose-response prediction in cancer is an active application field in machine learning. Using large libraries of \textit{in-vitro} drug sensitivity screens, the goal is to develop accurate predictive models that can be used to guide experimental design or inform treatment decisions. Building on previous work that makes use of permutation invariant multi-output Gaussian Processes in the context of dose-response prediction for drug combinations, we develop a variational approximation to these models. The variational approximation enables a more scalable model that provides uncertainty quantification and naturally handles missing data. Furthermore, we propose using a deep generative model to encode the chemical space in a continuous manner, enabling prediction for new drugs and new combinations. We demonstrate the performance of our model in a simple setting using a high-throughput dataset and show that the model is able to efficiently borrow information across outputs.</description>

      <title>Distances between Extension Spaces of Phylogenetic Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees summarize evolutionary relationships between organisms, and tools to analyze collections of phylogenetic trees enable contrasts between different genes' ancestry. The BHV metric space has enabled the analysis of collections of trees that share a common set of leaves, but many genes are not shared, even between closely related species. BHV extension spaces represent trees with non-identical leaf sets in a common BHV space, but limited analytical tools exist for extension spaces. We define the distance between two phylogenetic trees with non-identical leaf sets as the shortest BHV distance between their extension spaces, and develop a reduced gradient algorithm to compute this distance. We study the scalability of our algorithm and apply it to analyze gene trees spanning multiple domains of life. Our distance and algorithm offer a fully general, interpretable approach to analyzing both ancient and recent evolutionary divergence.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Biobanks and Cohort Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biobanks advance biomedical and clinical research by collecting and offering data and biological samples for numerous studies. However, the impact of these repositories varies greatly due to differences in their purpose, scope, governance, and data collected. Here, we computationally identified 2,663 biobanks and their textual mentions in 228,761 scientific articles, 16,210 grants, 15,469 patents, 1,769 clinical trials, and 9,468 public policy documents, helping characterize the academic communities that utilize and support them. We found a strong concentration of biobank-related research on a few diseases, where 20\% of publications focus on obesity, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, and diabetes. Moreover, collaboration, rather than citation count, shapes the community's recognition of a biobank. We show that, on average, 41.1\% of articles miss to reference any of the biobank's reference papers and 59.6\% include a biobank member as a co-author. Using a generalized linear model, we identified the key factors that contribute to the impact of a biobank, finding that an impactful biobank tends to be more open to external researchers, and that quality data -- especially linked medical records -- as opposed to large data, correlates with a higher impact in science, innovation, and disease. The collected data and findings are accessible through an open-access web application intended to inform strategies to expand access and maximize the value of these valuable resources.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective generative AI for designing novel brain-targeting small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strict selectivity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents one of the most formidable challenges to successful central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery. Computational methods to generate BBB permeable drugs in silico may be valuable tools in the CNS drug design pipeline. However, in real-world applications, BBB penetration alone is insufficient; rather, after transiting the BBB, molecules must bind to a specific target or receptor in the brain and must also be safe and non-toxic. To discover small molecules that concurrently satisfy these constraints, we use multi-objective generative AI to synthesize drug-like BBB-permeable small molecules. Specifically, we computationally synthesize molecules with predicted binding affinity against dopamine receptor D2, the primary target for many clinically effective antipsychotic drugs. After training several graph neural network-based property predictors, we adapt SyntheMol (Swanson et al., 2024), a recently developed Monte Carlo Tree Search-based algorithm for antibiotic design, to perform a multi-objective guided traversal over an easily synthesizable molecular space. We design a library of 26,581 novel and diverse small molecules containing hits with high predicted BBB permeability and favorable predicted safety and toxicity profiles, and that could readily be synthesized for experimental validation in the wet lab. We also validate top scoring molecules with molecular docking simulation against the D2 receptor and demonstrate predicted binding affinity on par with risperidone, a clinically prescribed D2-targeting antipsychotic. In the future, the SyntheMol-based computational approach described here may enable the discovery of novel neurotherapeutics for currently intractable disorders of the CNS.</description>

      <title>Scaffold Splits Overestimate Virtual Screening Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual Screening (VS) of vast compound libraries guided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) models is a highly productive approach to early drug discovery. Data splitting is crucial for better benchmarking of such AI models. Traditional random data splits produce similar molecules between training and test sets, conflicting with the reality of VS libraries which mostly contain structurally distinct compounds. Scaffold split, grouping molecules by shared core structure, is widely considered to reflect this real-world scenario. However, here we show that the scaffold split also overestimates VS performance. The reason is that molecules with different chemical scaffolds are often similar, which hence introduces unrealistically high similarities between training molecules and test molecules following a scaffold split. Our study examined three representative AI models on 60 NCI-60 datasets, each with approximately 30,000 to 50,000 molecules tested on a different cancer cell line. Each dataset was split with three methods: scaffold, Butina clustering and the more accurate Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) clustering. Regardless of the model, model performance is much worse with UMAP splits from the results of the 2100 models trained and evaluated for each algorithm and split. These robust results demonstrate the need for more realistic data splits to tune, compare, and select models for VS. For the same reason, avoiding the scaffold split is also recommended for other molecular property prediction problems. The code to reproduce these results is available at https://github.com/ScaffoldSplitsOverestimateVS</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent successes in virtual screening have been made possible by large models and extensive chemical libraries. However, combining these elements is challenging: the larger the model, the more expensive it is to run, making ultra-large libraries unfeasible. To address this, we developed a target-agnostic, efficacy-based molecule search model, which allows us to find structurally dissimilar molecules with similar biological activities. We used the best practices to design fast retrieval system, based on processor-optimized SIMD instructions, enabling us to screen the ultra-large 40B Enamine REAL library with 100\% recall rate. We extensively benchmarked our model and several state-of-the-art models for both speed performance and retrieval quality of novel molecules.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Bias in AI: A Systematic Review of Bias Detection and Mitigation Strategies in Electronic Health Record-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) in conjunction with electronic health records (EHRs) holds transformative potential to improve healthcare. Yet, addressing bias in AI, which risks worsening healthcare disparities, cannot be overlooked. This study reviews methods to detect and mitigate diverse forms of bias in AI models developed using EHR data. Methods: We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, analyzing articles from PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE published between January 1, 2010, and Dec 17, 2023. The review identified key biases, outlined strategies for detecting and mitigating bias throughout the AI model development process, and analyzed metrics for bias assessment. Results: Of the 450 articles retrieved, 20 met our criteria, revealing six major bias types: algorithmic, confounding, implicit, measurement, selection, and temporal. The AI models were primarily developed for predictive tasks in healthcare settings. Four studies concentrated on the detection of implicit and algorithmic biases employing fairness metrics like statistical parity, equal opportunity, and predictive equity. Sixty proposed various strategies for mitigating biases, especially targeting implicit and selection biases. These strategies, evaluated through both performance (e.g., accuracy, AUROC) and fairness metrics, predominantly involved data collection and preprocessing techniques like resampling, reweighting, and transformation. Discussion: This review highlights the varied and evolving nature of strategies to address bias in EHR-based AI models, emphasizing the urgent needs for the establishment of standardized, generalizable, and interpretable methodologies to foster the creation of ethical AI systems that promote fairness and equity in healthcare.</description>

      <title>From molecules to scaffolds to functional groups: building context-dependent molecular representation via multi-channel learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable molecular property prediction is essential for various scientific endeavors and industrial applications, such as drug discovery. However, the data scarcity, combined with the highly non-linear causal relationships between physicochemical and biological properties and conventional molecular featurization schemes, complicates the development of robust molecular machine learning models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a popular solution, utilizing large-scale, unannotated molecular data to learn a foundational representation of chemical space that might be advantageous for downstream tasks. Yet, existing molecular SSL methods largely overlook chemical knowledge, including molecular structure similarity, scaffold composition, and the context-dependent aspects of molecular properties when operating over the chemical space. They also struggle to learn the subtle variations in structure-activity relationship. This paper introduces a novel pre-training framework that learns robust and generalizable chemical knowledge. It leverages the structural hierarchy within the molecule, embeds them through distinct pre-training tasks across channels, and aggregates channel information in a task-specific manner during fine-tuning. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance across various molecular property benchmarks and offers strong advantages in particularly challenging yet ubiquitous scenarios like activity cliffs.</description>

      <title>A picture guide to cancer progression and monotonic accumulation models: evolutionary assumptions, plausible interpretations, and alternative uses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06824v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cancer progression and monotonic accumulation models were developed to discover dependencies in the irreversible acquisition of binary traits from cross-sectional data. They have been used in computational oncology and virology but also in widely different problems such as malaria progression. These methods have been applied to predict future states of the system, identify routes of feature acquisition, and improve patient stratification, and they hold promise for evolutionary-based treatments. New methods continue to be developed.
  But these methods have shortcomings, which are yet to be systematically critiqued, regarding key evolutionary assumptions and interpretations. After an overview of the available methods, we focus on why inferences might not be about the processes we intend. Using fitness landscapes, we highlight difficulties that arise from bulk sequencing and reciprocal sign epistasis, from conflating lines of descent, path of the maximum, and mutational profiles, and from ambiguous use of the idea of exclusivity. We examine how the previous concerns change when bulk sequencing is explicitly considered, and underline opportunities for addressing dependencies due to frequency-dependent selection. This review identifies major standing issues, and should encourage the use of these methods in other areas with a better alignment between entities and model assumptions.</description>

      <title>Group Dispersal Modelling Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the notion of grouped dispersal that have been introduced by Soubeyrand and co-authors \cite{soubeyrand2011patchy} to model the simultaneous (and hence dependent) dispersal  of several propagules from a single source  in a homogeneous  environment. We built a time continuous  measure valued process that takes into account the main feature of a grouped dispersal and derive its infinitesimal generator. To cope with the mutligeneration aspect associated to the demography we introduce  two types of propagules in the description of  the population which is one of  the main innovations here.  We also provide a rigorous description of the process and its generator. We derive  as well, some large population asymptotics of the process unveilling the  degenerate ultra parabolic system of PDE satisfied by the density of population. Finally, we also show that such a PDE system has a non-trivial solution which is unique in a certain functional space.</description>
