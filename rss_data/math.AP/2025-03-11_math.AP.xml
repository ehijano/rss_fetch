      <title>Variations on the capacitary inradius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss some properties of the capacitary inradius for an open set. This is an extension of the classical concept of inradius (i.e. the radius of a largest inscribed ball), which takes into account capacitary effects. Its introduction dates back to the pioneering works of Vladimir Maz'ya. We present some variants of this object and their mutual relations, as well as their connections with Poincar\'e inequalities. We also show that, under a mild regularity assumption on the boundary of the sets, the capacitary inradius is equivalent to the classical inradius. This comes with an explicit estimate and it permits to get a Buser-type inequality for a large class of open sets, whose boundaries may have power-like cusps of arbitrary order. Finally, we present a couple of open problems.</description>

      <title>Global existence of solutions of the stochastic incompressible non-Newtonian fluid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of solutions of stochastic incompressible non-Newtonian fluid models in $\mathbb{R}$. For the existence of solutions, we assume that the extra stress tensor $S$ is represented by $S({\mathbb A}) = {\mathbb F} ( {\mathbb A}) {\mathbb A}$ for $ n \times n$ matrix ${\mathbb G}$. We assume that ${\mathbb F}(0) $ is uniformly elliptic matrix and \begin{align*} |{\mathbb F}({\mathbb G})|, \,\, | D {\mathbb F} ({\mathbb G})|, \,\, | D^2({\mathbb F} ({\mathbb G}) ){\mathbb G}| \leq c \quad \mbox{for all} \quad 0 &lt; |{\mathbb G}| \leq r_0 \end{align*} for some $r_0 &gt; 0$. Note that ${\mathbb F}_1$ and ${\mathbb F}_2$ for $ d \in {\mathbb R}$, and ${\mathbb F}_3$ for $d \geq 3$ introduced in (1.2) satisfy our assumption.</description>

      <title>Non-homogeneous problem for the fractional wave equation with irregular coefficients and data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for a non-homogeneous wave equation generated by the fractional Laplacian and involving different kinds of lower order terms. We allow the equation coefficients and data to be of distributional type or less regular, having in mind the Dirac delta function and its powers, and we prove that the problem is well-posed in the sense of the concept of very weak solutions. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness in an appropriate sense and the coherence of the very weak solution concept with classical theory.</description>

      <title>Threshold for the existence of scattering states for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations without gauge invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a threshold phenomenon for the existence of scattering states for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. The nonlinearity includes a non-oscillatory term of the order lower than the Strauss exponent. We show that no scattering states exist for the equation in a weighted Sobolev space. It is emphasized that our method admits initial data with good properties, such as compactly supported smooth functions. The result indicates that the Strauss exponent acts as a threshold for the power of the nonlinearity that determines whether solutions scatter or not in the weighted space.</description>

      <title>On the Stability and Instability of Non-Homogeneous Fluid in a Bounded Domain Under the Influence of a General Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the instability and stability of specific steady-state solutions of the two-dimensional non-homogeneous, incompressible, and viscous Navier-Stokes equations under the influence of a general potential $f$. This potential is commonly used to model fluid motions in celestial bodies. First, we demonstrate that the system admits only steady-state solutions of the form $\left(\rho,\mathbf{V},p\right)=\left(\rho_{0},\mathbf{0},P_{0}\right)$, where $P_0$ and $\rho_0$ satisfy the hydrostatic balance condition $\nabla P_{0}=-\rho_{0}\nabla f$. Additionally, the relationship between $\rho_0$ and the potential function $f$ is constrained by the condition $\left(\partial_{y}\rho_{0}, \partial_{x}\rho_{0}\right)\cdot\left(\partial_{x}f,\partial_{y}f\right)=0$, which allows us to express $\nabla\rho_{0}$ as $h\left(x,y\right)\nabla f$. Second, when there exists a point $\left(x_{0},y_{0}\right)$ such that $h\left(x_{0},y_{0}\right)&gt;0$, we establish the linear instability of these solutions. Furthermore, we demonstrate their nonlinear instability in both the Lipschitz and Hadamard senses through detailed nonlinear energy estimates. This instability aligns with the well-known Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Our study signficantly extends and generalizes the existing mathematical results, which have predominantly focused on the scenarios involving a uniform gravitational field characterized by $\nabla f=(0,g)$. Finally, we show that these steady states are linearly stable provided that $h\left(x,y\right)&lt;0$ holds throughout the domain. Moreover, they exhibit nonlinear stability when $h\left(x,y\right)$ is a negative constant.</description>

      <title>Global boundedness in the higher-dimensional fully parabolic chemotaxis with weak singular sensitivity and logistic source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following chemotaxis system under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in a smooth, open, bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \geq 3$: \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t = \Delta u - \chi \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{u}{v^k} \nabla v \right) + ru - \mu u^2, &amp; \text{in } \Omega \times (0,T_{\rm max}),
  v_t = \Delta v - \alpha v + \beta u, &amp; \text{in } \Omega \times (0,T_{\rm max}),
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $k \in (0,1)$, and $\chi, r, \mu, \alpha, \beta$ are positive parameters. In this paper, we demonstrate that for suitably smooth initial data, the problem admits a unique nonnegative classical solution that remains globally bounded in time when $\mu$ is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Parabolic regularisation for increasing functions and applications to reaction-diffusion and reaction-cross-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a careful study of the parabolic equation $a\partial_t w - \Delta w = f$ with a rough coefficient $a$, homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, and the special assumption $\partial_t w \ge 0$. The H\"older regularity estimate obtained from this study is used to obtain quick proofs of already known results of regularity for quadratic reaction-diffusion systems coming out of reversible chemistry, and to get new results for reaction-cross diffusion systems including the triangular Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto system with moderately growing reaction terms.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity results for mixed local-nonlocal equations with singular and critical exponential nonlinearity in R^2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the existence of at least two positive weak solutions for a mixed local-nonlocal singular problem in the presence of critical exponential nonlinearity in dimension two. The novelty of this work is the inclusion of a variable singular exponent in the context of mixed operator and critical exponential nonlinearity in R^2. Our approach is based on sub-solution super-solution technique, combined with variational methods.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal problem for the time-fractional generalized telegraph equation with the Prabhakar fractional derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, nonlocal boundary value problem for the generalized telegraph equation with fractional-order derivatives is studied. Fractional differentiation is defined using the Caputo-Prabhakar operator. The equation is considered in a bounded rectangular domain of the plane with two independent variables. The nonlocal boundary condition is specified in the form of partial integral expressions of the unknown solution with respect to each variable, with given continuous kernels. Using the previously obtained representation of the solution to the Goursat problem for the studied equation in terms of Mittag-Leffler type functions, the problem is successfully reduced to a system of second-kind Volterra's integral equations with respect to the traces of the unknown solution on a part of the boundary of the region. As results, theorems of the existence and the uniqueness of the solution to the investigated problem is proved, and its representation is found in terms of the solutions to the obtained system of integral equations.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Convergence of Higher-Order Phase Transition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior as $\varepsilon \to 0$ of singularly perturbed phase transition models of order $n \geq 2$, given by \begin{align}
  G_\varepsilon^{\lambda,n}[u] := \int_I \frac 1\varepsilon W(u) -\lambda\varepsilon^{2n-3} (u^{(n-1)})^2 + \varepsilon^{2n-1} (u^{(n)})^2 \ dx, \quad u \in W^{n,2}(I), \end{align}
  where $\lambda &gt;0$ is fixed, $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ is an open bounded interval, and $W \in C^0(\mathbb{R})$ is a suitable double-well potential. We find that there exists a positive critical parameter depending on $W$ and $n$, such that the $\Gamma$-limit of $G_\varepsilon^{\lambda,n}$ with respect to the $L^1$-topology is given by a sharp interface functional in the subcritical regime. The cornerstone for the corresponding compactness property is a novel nonlinear interpolation inequality involving higher-order derivatives, which is based on Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system with moving contact line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a diffuse interface model for two-phase immiscible flows coupled by Navier-Stokes equations and mass-conserving Allen-Cahn equations. The contact line (the intersection of the fluid-fluid interface with the solid wall) moves along the wall when one fluid replaces the other, such as in liquid spreading or oil-water displacement. The system is equipped with the generalized Navier boundary conditions (GNBC) for the fluid velocity ${\boldsymbol u}$, and dynamic boundary condition or relaxation boundary condition for the phase field variable $\phi$. We first obtain the local-in-time existence of unique strong solutions to the 2D and 3D Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn (NSAC) system with generalized Navier boundary conditions and dynamic boundary condition. For the 2D case in channels, we further show these solutions can be extended to any large time $T$. Additionally, we prove the local-in-time strong solutions for systems with generalized Navier boundary conditions and relaxation boundary condition in 3D channels. Finally, we establish a global unique strong solution accompany with some exponential decay estimates when the fluids are near phase separation states and the contact angle closes to 90 degrees or the fluid-fluid interface tension constant is small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the existence of local strong solutions for the multivalued version of three-dimensional nonstationary Navier-Stokes equation in Banach spaces. Also, we considered a more general inclusion problem and studied the existence of solutions using the fixed point technique approach. We assume that the multivalued map possesses closed values (not necessarily convex values) and apply the Schauder Fixed Point Theorem in order to deduce the existence of fixed points.</description>

      <title>Geometric Hardy inequalities on the Heisenberg groups via convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove $L^p$-Hardy inequalities with distance to the boundary for domains in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$, $n\geq 1$. Our results are based on a geometric condition. This is first implemented for the Euclidean distance in certain non-convex domains. It is also implemented on half-spaces and convex polytopes for the distance defined by the gauge quasi-norm on $\mathbb{H}^n$ related to the fundamental solution of the horizontal Laplacian. In the more general context of a stratified Lie group of step two we study the superharmonicity and the weak $H$-concavity of the Euclidean distance to the boundary, thus obtaining an alternative proof for the $L^2$-Hardy inequality on convex domains. In all cases the constants are shown to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of radially symmetric singular self-similar solutions of the fast diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 3$, $0&lt;m&lt;\frac{n-2}{n}$, $\gamma&gt;0$ and $\eta&gt;0$. Suppose either (i) $\alpha\ne 0$ and $\beta=0$ or (ii) $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\beta\ne 0$ holds. We will study the elliptic equation $\Delta (f^m/m)+\alpha f+\beta x\cdot\nabla f=0$, $f&gt;0$, in $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$ with $\underset{\substack{r\to 0}}{\lim}\,r^{\gamma}f(r)=\eta$. This equation arises from the study of the singular self-similar solutions of the fast diffusion equation which blow up at the origin. We will prove that if there exists a radially symmetric singular solution of the above elliptic equation, then either $\gamma=\frac{2}{1-m}$ and $\alpha&gt;\frac{2\beta}{1-m}$ or $\gamma&gt;\frac{2}{1-m}$, $\beta\ne 0$ and $\gamma=\alpha/\beta$. As a consequence we obtain the non-existence of radially symmetric self-similar solution of the fast diffusion equation $u_t=\Delta (u^m/m)$, $u&gt;0$, which blows up at the origin with rate $|x|^{-\gamma}$ when either $0&lt;\gamma\ne\frac{2}{1-m}$ and $\gamma\ne\alpha/\beta$, $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\beta\ne 0$ or $\gamma=\frac{2}{1-m}$ and $\left(\alpha-\frac{2\beta}{1-m}\right)\eta\ne\frac{2(n-2-nm)}{(1-m)^2}$ holds.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact Riemannian manifolds in the case of wave, Klein-Gordon and fractional Schr\"odinger equations. Our results generalize the classical (single-function) Strichartz estimates on compact manifolds by Kapitanski, Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Dinh, and extend the Euclidean orthonormal version by Frank-Lewin-Lieb-Seiringer, Frank-Sabin, Bez-Lee-Nakamura. On the flat torus, our new results cover prior work of Nakamura for the Schr\"odinger equation, which exploits the dispersive estimate of Kenig-Ponce-Vega. We achieve sharp results on compact manifolds by combining the frequency localized dispersive estimates for small time intervals with the duality principle due to Frank-Sabin. We observe a new phenomenon that the results in the supercritical regime are sensitive to the geometry of the manifold. Moreover, we establish sharp Strichartz estimates on the flat torus for the fractional Schr\"odinger equations by proving a new decoupling inequality for certain non-smooth hypersurfaces. As applications, we obtain the well-posedness of infinite systems of dispersive equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the Poisson problem, \[ \begin{cases} -{\rm div}(d^\beta\nabla u)=f&amp;{\rm in}\ \Om\\ u=0&amp;{\rm on}\ \partial\Omega, \end{cases} \] where $\Om\subset\R^N$, $N\ge2$ is a smooth bounded domain, $f$ is a continuous function, $\beta&lt; 1$, and $d(x)=dist(x,\partial\Omega )$. We describe the behaviour of $u$ near $\partial\Om$ and discuss some of its regularity properties.</description>

      <title>Smoothing effect for third order operators with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the smoothing effect of some variable coefficient operators of the form $D_t-A$, where $A$ is a Weyl-quantized pseudo-differential operator of order $m=2,3$. The class under consideration includes, among others, KdV-type and ultrahyperbolic Schr\"odinger operators. We prove homogeneous and inhomogeneous smoothing estimates and use them to get well-posedness results for some NLIVPs with derivative nonlinearities. Finally, we investigate the so called non-trapping property of the bicharacteristic curves of the principal symbol of our operators.</description>

      <title>3D Surface Reconstruction and Volume Approximation via the meshless methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose several mathematical models for 3D surface reconstruction and volume estimation from a set of scattered cloud data. Three meshless methods including the interpolation-based method by RBF, PDE-based approach by Kansa's method and the Method of Fundamental Solutions are employed and compared. For the optimal recovery of the surfaces, the selection of free parameters in related PDE models are further studied and analyzed. Besides, several criteria like distance are employed in above methods instead of the classical parameter lambda determination strategy, which leads to a more reliable reconstruction performance. Finally, the volume estimation of 3D irregular objects is proposed based on the optimal reconstructed geometric models via proposed meshless methods. Numerous numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed surface reconstruction methods and the volume estimation strategy.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric and Michael-Simon inequalities on manifolds with asymptotically nonnegative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the validity of the isoperimetric inequality (or equivalently, an $L^1$ Euclidean-type Sobolev inequality) on manifolds with asymptotically non-negative sectional curvature. Unlike previous results in the literature, our approach does not require the negative part of the curvature to be globally small. Furthermore, we derive a Michael-Simon inequality on manifolds whose curvature is non-negative outside a compact set.
  The proofs employ the ABP method for isoperimetry, initially introduced by Cabr\'e in the Euclidean setting and subsequently extended and skillfully adapted by Brendle to the challenging context of non-negatively curved manifolds. Notably, we show that this technique can be localized to appropriate regions of the manifold. Additional key elements of the argument include the geometric structure at infinity of asymptotically non-negatively curved manifolds, their spectral properties - which ensure the non-negativity of a Bakry-\'Emery Ricci tensor on a conformal deformation of each end - and a result that deduces the validity of the isoperimetric inequality on the entire manifold, provided it holds outside a compact set.</description>

Abstract: The article presents the concept of a cumulant representation for distribution functions describing the states of many-particle systems with topological nearest-neighbor interaction. A solution to the Cauchy problem for the hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations for the cumulants of distribution functions of such systems is constructed. The connection between the constructed solution and the series expansion structure for a solution to the Cauchy problem of the BBGKY hierarchy has been established. Furthermore, the expansion structure for a solution to the Cauchy problem of the hierarchy of evolution equations for reduced observables of topologically interacting particles is established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) algorithm with a consensus point rescaled by a small fixed parameter $\kappa \in (0,1)$. Under minimal assumptions on the objective function and the initial data, we establish its unconditional convergence to the global minimizer. Our results hold in the asymptotic regime where both the time--horizon $t \to \infty$ and the inverse--temperature $\alpha \to \infty$, providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for the algorithm's global convergence. Furthermore, our findings extend to the case of multiple and non--discrete set of minimizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider heat operators on a convex domain $\Omega$, with a critically singular potential that diverges as the inverse square of the distance to the boundary of $\Omega$. We establish a general boundary controllability result for such operators in all dimensions, in particular providing the first such result in more than one spatial dimension. The key step in the proof is a novel global Carleman estimate that captures both the appropriate boundary conditions and the $H^1$-energy for this problem. The estimate is derived by combining two intermediate Carleman inequalities with distinct and carefully constructed weights involving non-smooth powers of the boundary distance.</description>

Abstract: We establish discrete Korn type inequalities for particle systems within the general class of objective structures that represents a far reaching generalization of crystal lattice structures. For space filling configurations whose symmetry group is a general space group we obtain a full discrete Korn inequality. For systems with non-trivial codimension our results provide an intrinsic rigidity estimate within the extended dimensions of the structure. As their continuum counterparts in elasticity theory, such estimates are at the core of energy estimates and, hence, a stability analysis for a wide class of atomistic particle systems.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general stability analysis for objective structures, which constitute a far reaching generalization of crystal lattice systems. We show that these particle systems, although in general neither periodic nor space filling, allow for the identification of stability constants in terms of representations of the underlying symmetry group and interaction potentials. Our main results provide general stability criteria and second order energy bounds for equilibrium configurations. In particular, a general computational algorithm to test objective structures for their stability is derived. By way of example we show that our method can be applied to verify the stability of carbon nanotubes with chirality.</description>

      <title>Dispersive estimates for higher order Schr\"odinger operators with scaling-critical potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a family of dispersive estimates for the higher order Schr\"odinger equation $iu_t=(-\Delta)^mu +Vu$ for $m\in \mathbb N$ with $m&gt;1$ and $2m&lt;n&lt;4m$. Here $V$ is a real-valued potential belonging to the closure of $C_0$ functions with respect to the generalized Kato norm, which has critical scaling. Under standard assumptions on the spectrum, we show that $e^{-itH}P_{ac}(H)$ satisfies a $|t|^{-\frac{n}{2m}}$ bound mapping $L^1$ to $L^\infty$ by adapting a Wiener inversion theorem. We further show the lack of positive resonances for the operator $(-\Delta)^m +V$ and a family of dispersive estimates for operators of the form $|H|^{\beta-\frac{n}{2m}}e^{-itH}P_{ac}(H)$ for $0&lt;\beta\leq \frac{n}{2}$. The results apply in both even and odd dimensions in the allowed range.</description>

      <title>The Method of Moving Spheres on the Hyperbolic Space and the Classification of Solutions and the prescribed Q-curvature problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of solutions to semilinear partial differential equations, as well as the classification of critical points of the corresponding functionals, have wide applications in the study of partial differential equations and differential geometry. The classical moving plane method and the method of moving sphere on the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ provide an effective approach to capture the symmetry of solutions. As far as we know, the moving sphere method has yet to be developed on the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$. In the present paper, we focus on the following equation \begin{equation*}
  P_k u = f(u) \end{equation*} on hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^n$, where $P_k$ denotes the GJMS operators on $\mathbb{H}^n$ and $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies certain growth conditions. We develop a moving sphere approach on $\mathbb{H}^n$ to obtain the symmetry propertyas well as the classification of positive solutions to the above equation. Our methods also rely on the Helgason-Fourier analysis and Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities on hyperbolic space together with a Kelvin transform we introduce on the hyperbolic space in this paper. We also present applications to the higher order prescribed $Q$-curvature problem on the hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Almost global existence and nonlinear asymptotic stability for bubble dynamics in inviscid compressible liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper considers the full nonlinear dynamics of a homogeneous bubble inside an unbounded isentropic compressible inviscid liquid. This model is described by a free-boundary problem of compressible Euler equations with nonlinear boundary conditions. The liquid is governed by the compressible Euler equation, while the bubble surface is determined by the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions on the bubble-liquid interface. This classical model is of great concern in physics due to its wide applications. We begin by proving the local existence and uniqueness using energy methods under an iteration scheme. For long-time behavior, we developed a generalized weighted space-time estimate, which extends the Keel-Smith-Sogge estimate to nonlinear wave equations regardless of the boundary conditions, at the cost of the appearance of a boundary term with only lowest-order derivatives. This term is handled by using characteristics to track the backward pressure wave. Then the almost global existence and nonlinear radiative decay are proved through a bootstrap argument, which encompasses the energy estimate, the generalized Keel-Smith-Sogge estimate, and the analysis of backward pressure waves. The analysis of the backward pressure wave by characteristics involves a loss of derivative due to the quasilinear nature of the system. This is overcome by the above generalized weighted spacetime estimate with the lowest-order boundary term, which actually provides a mechanism to gain derivatives back. The coupling of these two methods is the novelty of the present paper and can not only be used for the current question but is expected to be applied to other questions regarding nonlinear wave equations with complicated boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: Nowadays a great attention has been focused on the discrete fractional Laplace operator as the natural counterpart of the continuous one. In this paper, we discretize the fractional Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^{s}$ for an arbitrary finite graph and any positive real number $s$. It is shown that $(-\Delta)^{s}$ can be explicitly represented by eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator $-\Delta$. Moreover, we study its important properties, such as $(-\Delta)^{s}$ converges to $-\Delta$ as $s$ tends to $1$; while $(-\Delta)^{s}$ converges to the identity map as $s$ tends to $0$ on a specific function space. For related problems involving the fractional Laplace operator, we consider the fractional Kazdan-Warner equation and obtain several existence results via variational principles and the method of upper and lower solutions.</description>

Abstract: Nonexistence results for positive supersolutions of the equation $$-Lu=u^p\quad\text{in $\mathbb R^N_+$}$$ are obtained, $-L$ being any symmetric and stable linear operator, positively homogeneous of degree $2s$, $s\in(0,1)$, whose spectral measure is absolutely continuous and positive only in a relative open set of the unit sphere of $\mathbb R^N$. The results are sharp: $u\equiv 0$ is the only nonnegative supersolution in the subcritical regime $1\leq p\leq\frac{N+s}{N-s}\,$, while nontrivial supersolutions exist, at least for some specific $-L$, as soon as $p&gt;\frac{N+s}{N-s}$. \\ The arguments used rely on a rescaled test function's method, suitably adapted to such nonlocal setting with weak diffusion; they are quite general and also employed to obtain Liouville type results in the whole space.</description>

Abstract: We consider the higher order Schr\"odinger operator $H=(-\Delta)^m+V(x)$ in $n$ dimensions with real-valued potential $V$ when $n&gt;4m$, $m\in \mathbb N$. We adapt our recent results for $m&gt;1$ to show that when $H$ has a threshold eigenvalue the wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ for the natural range $1\leq p&lt;\frac{n}{2m}$ in both even and odd dimensions. The approach used works without distinguishing even and odd cases, and matches the range of boundedness in the classical case when $m=1$. The proof applies in the classical $m=1$ case as well and simplifies the argument.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a boundary case of the classical prescribed curvature problem. We focus on prescribing the scalar curvature function K and the boundary mean curvature H on the standard ball. Our analysis extendes previous studies by considering the scenario where the curvatures K and H are close to constants. Using a perturbative approach and leveraging the ansatz introduced by Han and Li, we establish new existence results for the conformal metric when the prescribed curvatures are near constants</description>

  \Box u= N(x,t,u)u, \end{equation*} where the nonlinearity~$ N(x,t,u)u$ is assumed to satisfy appropriate boundedness assumptions.
  Under these appropriate assumptions we prove that the free channel wave operator exists. Moreover, if the interaction term~$N(x,t,u)u$ is localised, then we prove that the global solution of the full nonlinear equation can be decomposed into a `free' part and a `localised' part.
  The present work can be seen as an extension of the scattering results of~\cite{SW20221} for the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Compactness of the $Q$-curvature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete resolution to the question of the $C^4$-compactness for the solution set of the constant $Q$-curvature problem on a smooth closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $5 \leq n \leq 24$. For dimensions $n\geq 25$, an example of an $L^{\infty}$-unbounded sequence of solutions for $n \geq 25$ has been known for over a decade (Wei-Zhao). On the other hand, Li-Xiong established compactness in dimensions $5\leq n \leq 9$ (under some conditions). Our principal observation is that the linearized equation associated with the $Q$-curvature problem can be transformed into an overdetermined linear system, which admits a nontrivial solution due to an unexpected algebraic structure of the Paneitz operator. This key insight plays a crucial role in extending the compactness result to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Type-I Superconductors in the Limit as the London Penetration Depth Goes to 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an explicit formula for the approximate solution of the static London equations. These equations describe the currents and magnetic fields in a Type-I superconductor. We represent the magnetic field as a 2-form and the current as a 1-form, and assume that the superconducting material is contained in a bounded, connected set, $\Omega,$ with smooth boundary. The London penetration depth gives an estimate for the thickness of the layer near $\partial\Omega$ where the current is largely carried. In an earlier paper, we introduced a system of Fredholm integral equations of second kind, on $\partial\Omega,$ for solving the physically relevant scattering problems in this context. In real Type-I superconductors the penetration depth is very small, typically about $100$nm, which often renders the integral equation approach computationally intractable. In this paper we provide an explicit formula for approximate solutions, with essentially optimal error estimates, as the penetration depth tends to zero. Our work makes extensive use of the Hodge decomposition of differential forms on manifolds with boundary, and thus evokes Kohn's work on the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Stationary Solution to a 1-D Model for the MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of a one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics model (1-D MHD) with mixed vortex stretching effects, introduced by Dai, Vyas, and Zhang. Using techniques similar to those developed by Lei, Liu, and Ren for the De Gregorio equation, we establish global-in-time well-posedness for initial data near a stationary point. Our result is analogous to the exponential stability of the ground state of the De Gregorio equation.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many self-similar blow-up profiles for the Keller-Segel system in dimensions 3 to 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the method of matched asymptotic expansions and Banach fixed point theorem, we rigorously construct infinitely many self-similar blow-up profiles for the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{l} \partial_{t} u=\Delta u-\nabla \cdot\left(u \nabla \Phi_{u}\right), \\ 0=\Delta \Phi_{u}+u,\\ u(\cdot,0)=u_0 \geq 0 \end{array}\quad \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{d},\right. \end{equation*} where $d\in \{3,\cdots,9\}$. Our findings demonstrate that the infinitely many backward self-similar profiles approximate the rescaling radial steady-state near the origin (i.e. $0&lt;|x|\ll1$) and $\frac{2(d-2)}{|x|^2}$ at spatial infinity (i.e. $|x|\gg1$). We also establish the convergence of the self-similar blow-up solutions as time tends to the blow-up time $T&gt;0$. Our results can give a refined description of backward self-similar profiles for all $|x|\geq 0$ rather than for $0&lt;|x|\ll1$ or $|x|\gg1$, indicating that the blow-up point is the origin and $$ u(x,t)\sim \frac{1}{|x|^2},\ \ \ x\ne0,\ \text{as}\ t\to T. $$</description>

      <title>On the system of $2$-D elastic waves with critical space dependent damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the system of elastic waves with critical space dependent damping $V(x)$. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the $2$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\bf R}^{2}$, and we obtain faster decay rates of the total energy as time goes to infinity. In the $2$-D case we do not have any suitable Hardy type inequality, so generally one has no idea to establish optimal energy decay. We develope a special type of multiplier method combined with some estimates brought by the $2$-D Newton potential belonging to the usual Laplacian $-\Delta$, not the operator $-a^2\Delta - (b^{2}-a^{2})\nabla {\rm div}$ itself. The property of finite speed propagation is important to get results for this system.</description>

      <title>Integral Quadratic Constraints on Linear Infinite-dimensional Systems for Robust Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.06283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework to assess the stability of an ordinary differential equation which is coupled to a 1D-partial differential equation (PDE). The stability theorem is based on a new result on Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) and expressed in terms of two linear matrix inequalities with a moderate computational burden. The IQCs are not generated using dissipation inequalities involving the whole state of an infinite-dimensional system, but by using projection coefficients of the infinite-dimensional state. This permits to generalize our robustness result to many other PDEs. The proposed methodology is applied to a time-delay system and numerical results comparable to those in the literature are obtained.</description>

      <title>Minimal Surface Equation and Bernstein Property on RCD spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $(X,d,m)$ is an RCD(K,N) space and $u \in W^{1,1}_{loc}(X)$ is a solution of the minimal surface equation, then $u$ is harmonic on its graph (which has a natural metric measure space structure). If K=0 this allows to obtain an Harnack inequality for $u$, which in turn implies the Bernstein property, meaning that any positive solution to the minimal surface equation must be constant. As an application, we obtain oscillation estimates and a Bernstein Theorem for minimal graphs in products $M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a smooth manifold (possibly weighted and with boundary) with non-negative Ricci curvature</description>

      <title>New spectral Bishop-Gromov and Bonnet-Myers theorems and applications to isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a sharp and rigid spectral generalization of the classical Bishop--Gromov volume comparison theorem: if a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\geq3$ satisfies $$ \lambda_1\left(-\frac{n-1}{n-2}\Delta+\mathrm{Ric}\right)\geq n-1, $$ then $\operatorname{vol}(M)\leq\operatorname{vol}(\mathbb S^{n})$, and $\pi_1(M)$ is finite. The constant $\frac{n-1}{n-2}$ cannot be improved, and if $\mathrm{vol}(M)=\mathrm{vol}(\mathbb S^n)$ holds, then $M\cong \mathbb S^{n}$. A sharp generalization of the Bonnet--Myers theorem is also shown under the same spectral condition.
  The proofs involve the use of a new unequally weighted isoperimetric problem, and unequally warped $\mu$-bubbles. As an application, in dimensions $3\leq n\leq 5$, we infer sharp results on the isoperimetric structure at infinity of complete manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and uniformly positive spectral biRicci curvature.
  Furthermore, the main result of this paper is applied in Mazet's recent solution of the stable Bernstein problem in $\mathbb R^6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a conformal metric with finite total Q-curvature, we show that the assumptions on scalar curvature sensitively control the Q-curvature integral. Meanwhile, we introduce a conformal mass on such manifolds to provide a sufficient and necessary condition for normal metric without metric completeness assumption. As applications, we derive volume comparison theorems and a positive mass type theorem on such manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the required number of electrodes for uniqueness and convex reformulation in an inverse coefficient problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computer-assisted proof for the required number of electrodes for uniqueness and global reconstruction for the inverse Robin transmission problem, where the corrosion function on the boundary of an interior object is to be determined from electrode current-voltage measurements. We consider the shunt electrode model where, in contrast to the standard Neumann boundary condition, the applied electrical current is only partially known. The aim is to determine the corrosion coefficient with a finite number of measurements.
  In this paper, we present a numerically verifiable criterion that ensures unique solvability of the inverse problem, given a desired resolution. This allows us to explicitly determine the required number and position of the electrodes. Furthermore, we will present an error estimate for noisy data. By rewriting the problem as a convex optimization problem, our aim is to develop a globally convergent reconstruction algorithm.</description>
