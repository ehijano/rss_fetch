      <title>The impact of nodes of information dissemination on epidemic spreading in dynamic multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemic spreading processes on dynamic multiplex networks provide a more accurate description of natural spreading processes than those on single layered networks. To describe the influence of different individuals in the awareness layer on epidemic spreading, we propose a two-layer network-based epidemic spreading model, including some individuals who neglect the epidemic, and we explore how individuals with different properties in the awareness layer will affect the spread of epidemics. The two-layer network model is divided into an information transmission layer and a disease spreading layer. Each node in the layer represents an individual with different connections in different layers. Individuals with awareness will be infected with a lower probability compared to unaware individuals, which corresponds to the various epidemic prevention measures in real life. We adopt the micro-Markov chain approach to analytically derive the threshold for the proposed epidemic model, which demonstrates that the awareness layer affects the threshold of disease spreading. We then explore how individuals with different properties would affect the disease spreading process through extensive Monte Carlo numerical simulations. We find that individuals with high centrality in the awareness layer would significantly inhibit the transmission of infectious diseases. Additionally, we propose conjectures and explanations for the approximately linear effect of individuals with low centrality in the awareness layer on the number of infected individuals.</description>

      <title>Why the Metric Backbone Preserves Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric backbone of a weighted graph is the union of all-pairs shortest paths. It is obtained by removing all edges $(u,v)$ that are not the shortest path between $u$ and $v$. In networks with well-separated communities, the metric backbone tends to preserve many inter-community edges, because these edges serve as bridges connecting two communities, but tends to delete many intra-community edges because the communities are dense. This suggests that the metric backbone would dilute or destroy the community structure of the network. However, this is not borne out by prior empirical work, which instead showed that the metric backbone of real networks preserves the community structure of the original network well. In this work, we analyze the metric backbone of a broad class of weighted random graphs with communities, and we formally prove the robustness of the community structure with respect to the deletion of all the edges that are not in the metric backbone. An empirical comparison of several graph sparsification techniques confirms our theoretical finding and shows that the metric backbone is an efficient sparsifier in the presence of communities.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Transfer, Knowledge Gaps, and Knowledge Silos in Citation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of science relies on the exchange of ideas across disciplines and the integration of diverse knowledge domains. However, tracking knowledge flows and interdisciplinary integration in rapidly evolving, multidisciplinary fields remains a significant challenge. This work introduces a novel network analysis framework to study the dynamics of knowledge transfer directly from citation data. By applying dynamic community detection to cumulative, time-evolving citation networks, we can identify research areas as groups of papers sharing knowledge sources and outputs. Our analysis characterises the life-cycles and knowledge transfer patterns of these dynamic communities over time. We demonstrate our approach through a case study of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) research, an emerging interdisciplinary field at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and psychology. Key findings include: (i) knowledge transfer between these important foundational topics and the contemporary topics in XAI research is limited, and the extent of knowledge transfer varies across different contemporary research topics; (ii) certain application domains exist as isolated "knowledge silos"; (iii) significant "knowledge gaps" are identified between related XAI research areas, suggesting opportunities for cross-pollination and improved knowledge integration. By mapping interdisciplinary integration and bridging knowledge gaps, this work can inform strategies to synthesise ideas from disparate sources and drive innovation. More broadly, our proposed framework enables new insights into the evolution of knowledge ecosystems directly from citation data, with applications spanning literature review, research planning, and science policy.</description>

      <title>The Failed Migration of Academic Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following change in Twitter's ownership and subsequent changes to content moderation policies, many in academia looked to move their discourse elsewhere and migration to Mastodon was pursued by some. Our study looks at the dynamics of this migration. Utilizing publicly available user account data, we track the posting activity of academics on Mastodon over a one year period. Our analyses reveal significant challenges sustaining user engagement on Mastodon due to its decentralized structure as well as competition from other platforms such as Bluesky and Threads. The movement lost momentum after an initial surge of enthusiasm as most users did not maintain their activity levels, and those who did faced lower levels of engagement compared to Twitter. Our findings highlight the challenges involved in transitioning professional communities to decentralized platforms, emphasizing the need for focusing on migrating social connections for long-term user engagement.</description>

      <title>Subsuming Complex Networks by Node Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of node walk in graphs and complex networks has been addressed, consisting of one or more nodes that move into adjacent nodes, henceforth incorporating the respective connections. This type of dynamics is then applied to subsume complex networks. Three types of networks (Erd\'os- R\'eny, Barab\'asi-Albert, as well as a geometric model) are considered, while three node walks heuristics (uniformly random, largest degree, and smallest degree) are taken into account. Several interesting results are obtained and described, including the identification that the subsuming dynamics depend strongly on both the specific topology of the networks as well as the criteria controlling the node walks. The use of node walks as a model for studying the relationship between network topology and dynamics is motivated by this result. In addition, relatively high correlations between the initial node degree and the accumulated strength of the walking node were observed for some combinations of network types and dynamic rules, allowing some of the properties of the subsumption to be roughly predicted from the initial topology around the waking node which has been found, however, not to be enough for full determination of the subsumption dynamics. Another interesting result regards the quite distinct signatures (along the iterations) of walking node strengths obtained for the several considered combinations of network type and subsumption rules.</description>

      <title>Shaping History: Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for the Analysis and Dating of Cuneiform Tablets over Three Millennia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cuneiform tablets, emerging in ancient Mesopotamia around the late fourth millennium BCE, represent one of humanity's earliest writing systems. Characterized by wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, these artifacts provided insight into Mesopotamian civilization across various domains. Traditionally, the analysis and dating of these tablets rely on subjective assessment of shape and writing style, leading to uncertainties in pinpointing their exact temporal origins. Recent advances in digitization have revolutionized the study of cuneiform by enhancing accessibility and analytical capabilities. Our research uniquely focuses on the silhouette of tablets as significant indicators of their historical periods, diverging from most studies that concentrate on textual content. Utilizing an unprecedented dataset of over 94,000 images from the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative collection, we apply deep learning methods to classify cuneiform tablets, covering over 3,000 years of history. By leveraging statistical, computational techniques, and generative modeling through Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), we achieve substantial advancements in the automatic classification of these ancient documents, focusing on the tablets' silhouettes as key predictors. Our classification approach begins with a Decision Tree using height-to-width ratios and culminates with a ResNet50 model, achieving a 61% macro F1-score for tablet silhouettes. Moreover, we introduce novel VAE-powered tools to enhance explainability and enable researchers to explore changes in tablet shapes across different eras and genres. This research contributes to document analysis and diplomatics by demonstrating the value of large-scale data analysis combined with statistical methods. These insights offer valuable tools for historians and epigraphists, enriching our understanding of cuneiform tablets and the cultures that produced them.</description>

      <title>NoisyGL: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks under Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) exhibit strong potential in node classification task through a message-passing mechanism. However, their performance often hinges on high-quality node labels, which are challenging to obtain in real-world scenarios due to unreliable sources or adversarial attacks. Consequently, label noise is common in real-world graph data, negatively impacting GNNs by propagating incorrect information during training. To address this issue, the study of Graph Neural Networks under Label Noise (GLN) has recently gained traction. However, due to variations in dataset selection, data splitting, and preprocessing techniques, the community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark, which impedes deeper understanding and further development of GLN. To fill this gap, we introduce NoisyGL in this paper, the first comprehensive benchmark for graph neural networks under label noise. NoisyGL enables fair comparisons and detailed analyses of GLN methods on noisy labeled graph data across various datasets, with unified experimental settings and interface. Our benchmark has uncovered several important insights that were missed in previous research, and we believe these findings will be highly beneficial for future studies. We hope our open-source benchmark library will foster further advancements in this field. The code of the benchmark can be found in https://github.com/eaglelab-zju/NoisyGL.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and triggers of misinformation on vaccines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked renewed attention on the prevalence of misinformation online, whether intentional or not, underscoring the potential risks posed to individuals' quality of life associated with the dissemination of misconceptions and enduring myths on health-related subjects. In this study, we analyze 6 years (2016-2021) of Italian vaccine debate across diverse social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube), encompassing all major news sources - both questionable and reliable. We first use the symbolic transfer entropy analysis of news production time-series to dynamically determine which category of sources, questionable or reliable, causally drives the agenda on vaccines. Then, leveraging deep learning models capable to accurately classify vaccine-related content based on the conveyed stance and discussed topic, respectively, we evaluate the focus on various topics by news sources promoting opposing views and compare the resulting user engagement. Aside from providing valuable resources for further investigation of vaccine-related misinformation, particularly in a language (Italian) that receives less attention in scientific research compared to languages like English, our study uncovers misinformation not as a parasite of the news ecosystem that merely opposes the perspectives offered by mainstream media, but as an autonomous force capable of even overwhelming the production of vaccine-related content from the latter. While the pervasiveness of misinformation is evident in the significantly higher engagement of questionable sources compared to reliable ones, our findings underscore the importance of consistent and thorough pro-vax coverage. This is especially crucial in addressing the most sensitive topics where the risk of misinformation spreading and potentially exacerbating negative attitudes toward vaccines among the users involved is higher.</description>

      <title>Degree Heterogeneity in Higher-Order Networks: Inference in the Hypergraph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02818v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-model for random graphs is commonly used for representing pairwise interactions in a network with degree heterogeneity. Going beyond pairwise interactions, Stasi et al. (2014) introduced the hypergraph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-model for capturing degree heterogeneity in networks with higher-order (multi-way) interactions. In this paper we initiate the rigorous study of the hypergraph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-model with multiple layers, which allows for hyperedges of different sizes across the layers. To begin with, we derive the rates of convergence of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate and establish their minimax rate optimality. We also derive the limiting distribution of the ML estimate and construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the model parameters. Next, we consider the goodness-of-fit problem in the hypergraph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-model. Specifically, we establish the asymptotic normality of the likelihood ratio (LR) test under the null hypothesis, derive its detection threshold, and also its limiting power at the threshold. Interestingly, the detection threshold of the LR test turns out to be minimax optimal, that is, all tests are asymptotically powerless below this threshold. The theoretical results are further validated in numerical experiments. In addition to developing the theoretical framework for estimation and inference for hypergraph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-models, the above results fill a number of gaps in the graph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-model literature, such as the minimax optimality of the ML estimates and the non-null properties of the LR test, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been studied before.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Temporal Graph Representation Learning for Tactical Networks Future State Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resource allocation in tactical ad-hoc networks presents unique challenges due to their dynamic and multi-hop nature. Accurate prediction of future network connectivity is essential for effective resource allocation in such environments. In this paper, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Graph Encoder-Decoder (STGED) framework for Tactical Communication Networks that leverages both spatial and temporal features of network states to learn latent tactical behaviors effectively. STGED hierarchically utilizes graph-based attention mechanism to spatially encode a series of communication network states, leverages a recurrent neural network to temporally encode the evolution of states, and a fully-connected feed-forward network to decode the connectivity in the future state. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that STGED consistently outperforms baseline models by large margins across different time-steps input, achieving an accuracy of up to 99.2\% for the future state prediction task of tactical communication networks.</description>
