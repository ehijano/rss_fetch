      <title>A simple procedure for generating a Kappa distribution in PIC simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For kinetic modeling of plasma processes in space, a rejection-sampling procedure for generating a Kappa distribution in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation is proposed. A Pareto distribution is employed as an envelope distribution. The procedure only requires uniform variates, and its acceptance efficiency is $\approx 0.73$--$0.8$.</description>

      <title>Numerical model for pellet rocket acceleration in PELOTON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct numerical simulation model for the rocket acceleration of pellets in thermonuclear fusion devices has been developed for PELOTON, a 3D Lagrangian particle pellet code [R. Samulyak et al, Nuclear Fusion 61 (4), 046007 (2021)], and validated using shattered pellet injection (SPI) experiments in JET. The pellet rocket acceleration is driven by grad-B drift of the ablation cloud that creates asymmetry and non-uniform heating of the cloud. The model accounts for non-uniform charging of the ablation cloud by hot plasma electrons as well as local plasma gradients. The increased pressure on the high-field-side compared to the low-field-side leads to pellet (fragment) rocket acceleration. Pure deuterium and deuterium-neon mixture models have been implemented. The background plasma states have been obtained by using a new plasma cooling model for PELOTON. The cooling model distributes the ablated material within the corresponding flux volumes and accounts for ionization and other energy losses, Ohmic heating by toroidal currents, and the energy exchange between ions and electrons. Plasma profiles predicted by PELOTON cooling model have been compared with JOREK and INDEX simulations. PELOTON simulations of rocket acceleration and the corresponding trajectories of deuterium fragments are consistent with experimentally measured trajectories in JET. We show that composite deuterium-neon pellets containing 0.5% of neon experienced smaller deviation of their trajectories compared to the pure deuterium case. We simulate various spatial configurations of pellet fragments and demonstrate the cloud overlap impact on rocket acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of plasma state gradients on the rocket acceleration. Future work will focus on the rocket acceleration of SPI in projected ITER plasmas and the development of the corresponding scaling law for the rocket acceleration.</description>

      <title>Generation of ultrahigh field by micro-bubble implosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking the 100-MeV barrier for proton acceleration will help elucidate fundamental physics and advance practical applications from inertial confinement fusion to tumour therapy. Herein we propose a novel concept of bubble implosions. A bubble implosion combines micro-bubbles and ultraintense laser pulses of 10^20-10^22W/cm^2 to generate ultrahigh fields and relativistic protons. The bubble wall protons undergo volumetric acceleration toward the centre due to the spherically symmetric Coulomb force and the innermost protons accumulate at the centre with a density comparable to the interior of a white dwarf. Then an unprecedentedly high electric field is formed, which produces an energetic proton flash. Three-dimensional particle simulations confirm the robustness of Coulomb-imploded bubbles, which behave as nano-pulsars with repeated implosions and explosions to emit protons. Current technologies should be sufficient to experimentally verify concept of bubble implosions.</description>

      <title>Optimization of laser illumination configuration for directly driven inertial confinement fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimum laser configurations are presented to achieve high illumination uniformity with directly driven inertial confinement fusion targets. Assuming axisymmetric absorption pattern of individual laser beams, theoretical models are reviewed in terms of the number of laser beams, system imperfection, and laser beam patterns. Utilizing a self-organizing system of charged particles on a sphere, a simple numerical model is provided to give an optimal configuration for an arbitrary number of laser beams. As a result, such new configurations as M48 and M60 are found to show substantially higher illumination uniformity than any other existing direct drive systems. A new polar direct-drive scheme is proposed with the laser axes keeping off the target center, which can be applied to laser configurations designed for indirectly driven inertial fusion.</description>

      <title>Operator Formalism for Laser-Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an operator-based framework for laser--plasma wakefield acceleration (LPWA) in capillary discharges, providing a compact and systematic description of the coupled dynamics of laser fields and plasma response. The formalism employs key operators: the transverse modal operator $\hat{K}$, the nonlinear plasma operator $\hat{N}[\Psi]$, the plasma oscillation operator $\hat{\Omega}_p^{\,2}$, and the ponderomotive source operator $\hat{\alpha}$, which together describe mode coupling, plasma oscillations, and nonlinear feedback induced by the ponderomotive force. In the linear regime, the system is characterized by invariant subspaces associated with stable modal structures, while nonlinear interactions break these invariances, leading to mode mixing and complex dynamics. The approach establishes a direct connection between LPWA and Hilbert-space operator theory, including the invariant subspace, providing a formal mathematical interpretation of energy transfer and wakefield formation. Furthermore, the operator formalism integrates with neural operator methods, allowing efficient approximation of $\hat{N}$ and $\hat{\alpha}$ for reduced-order modeling and predictive control. This hybrid physics--AI framework offers a robust foundation for modeling, analysis, and optimization of high-intensity laser--plasma interactions in next-generation accelerator experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification and Particle Acceleration in Weakly Magnetized Trans-relativistic Electron-ion Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physics of quasi-parallel trans-relativistic shocks propagating in weakly magnetized plasmas by means of long-duration two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The structure of the shock precursor is shaped by a competition between the Bell instability and the Weibel instability. The Bell instability is dominant at relatively high magnetizations $(\sigma\gtrsim10^{-3})$, whereas the Weibel instability prevails at lower magnetizations $(\sigma\lesssim10^{-4})$. Bell-dominated shocks efficiently accelerate ions, converting a fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim0.2$ of the upstream flow energy into downstream nonthermal ion energy. The maximum energy of nonthermal ions exhibits a Bohm scaling in time, as $E_{\max}\propto t$. A much smaller fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\ll0.1$ of the upstream flow energy goes into downstream nonthermal electrons in the Bell-dominated regime. On the other hand, Weibel-dominated shocks efficiently generate both nonthermal ions and electrons with $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\sim0.1$, albeit with a slower scaling for the maximum energy, $E_{\mathrm{max}}\propto t^{1/2}$. Our results are applicable to a wide range of trans-relativistic shocks, including the termination shocks of extragalactic jets, the late stages of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and shocks in fast blue optical transients.</description>

      <title>GPU-Portable Real-Space Density Functional Theory Implementation on Unified-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a GPU-portable implementation of a real-space density functional theory (DFT) code ``QUMASUN'' and benchmark it on the new Plasma Simulator featuring Intel Xeon 6980P CPUs, and AMD MI300A GPUs. Additional tests were performed on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. In particular MI300A supports unified memory and GH200 supports coherent memory interconnect, simplifying GPU porting. A lightweight C++ lambda-based layer enables CPU, CUDA, and HIP execution without OpenMP/OpenACC preprocessor directives. For diamond (216 atoms) and tungsten (128 atoms) systems, MI300A and GH200 achieve 2.0-2.8 $\times$ and 2.3-2.4 $\times$ speedups over a 256-core Xeon node. The compute-bound kernels, which are fast Fourier transforms (FFT), dense matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM) and eigenvalue solver, show substantial acceleration on both GPUs, indicating that the present GPU-portable approach can benefit a wide range of plasma-fusion simulation codes beyond DFT.</description>

      <title>High-repetition-rate, all-reflective optical guiding and electron acceleration in helium using an off-axis axicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present recent results on high-power guiding and laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the ELBA beamline at ELI Beamlines, using the L3-HAPLS laser system (13 J, 30 fs, 0.2 Hz). By employing self-waveguiding in a 20 cm plasma channel in helium, we achieved stable acceleration of electron beams to energies approaching 5 GeV. A novel all-reflective optical setup, including an off-axis reflective axicon, enabled efficient acceleration at 0.2 Hz and guiding at repetition rates up to 3.3 Hz. This compact single laser, single compressor implementation of plasma channels for electron acceleration stabilizes electron pointing and enhances energy gain without requiring modifications to the laser system, paving the way for broader adoption of the technology across user facilities.</description>

      <title>Degrees of universality in wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence of weakly interacting waves displays a great deal of universality: independence of the details of the interaction and of the pumping and dissipation scales. Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity.
  We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Heat Flux in Quasi-Parallel Collisionless Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisionless plasma shocks are a common feature of many space and astrophysical systems and are sources of high-energy particles and non-thermal emission, channeling as much as 20\% of the shock's energy into non-thermal particles. The generation and acceleration of these non-thermal particles have been extensively studied, however, how these particles feed back on the shock hydrodynamics has not been fully treated. This work presents the results of self-consistent hybrid particle-in-cell simulations that show the effect of self-generated non-thermal particle populations on the nature of collisionless, quasi-parallel shocks. They contribute to a significant heat flux density upstream of the shock. Non-thermal particles downstream of the shock leak into the upstream region, taking energy away from the shock. This increases the compression ratio, slows the shock down, and flattens the non-thermal population's spectral index for lower Mach number shocks. We incorporate this into a revised theory for the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions that include this effect and it shows excellent agreement with simulations. The results have the potential to explain discrepancies between predictions and observations in a wide range of systems, such as inaccuracies of predictions of arrival times of coronal mass ejections and the conflicting radio and x-ray observations of intracluster shocks.
  These effects will likely need to be included in fluid modeling to accurately predict shock evolution.</description>

      <title>Long-living Equilibria in Kinetic Astrophysical Plasma Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence in classical fluids is characterized by persistent structures that emerge from the chaotic landscape. We investigate the analogous process in fully kinetic plasma turbulence by using high-resolution, direct numerical simulations in two spatial dimensions. We observe the formation of long-living vortices with a profile typical of macroscopic, magnetically dominated force-free states. Inspired by the Harris pinch model for inhomogeneous equilibria, we describe these metastable solutions with a self-consistent kinetic model in a cylindrical coordinate system centered on a representative vortex, starting from an explicit form of the particle velocity distribution function. Such new equilibria can be simplified to a Gold-Hoyle solution of the modified force-free state. Turbulence is mediated by the long-living structures, accompanied by transients in which such vortices merge and form self-similarly new metastable equilibria. This process can be relevant to the comprehension of various astrophysical phenomena, going from the formation of plasmoids in the vicinity of massive compact objects to the emergence of coherent structures in the heliosphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05727v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints. For a cubic temperature the equilibrium has an analytic solution which is investigated.</description>

      <title>FPGA-Accelerated Real-Time Beam Emission Spectroscopy Diagnostics at DIII-D Using the SLAC Neural Network Library for ML Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving reliable real-time control of tokamak plasmas is essential for sustaining high-performance operation in next-generation fusion reactors. A major challenge is the accurate and timely prediction of edge-localized modes (ELMs), especially in high-confinement regimes such as wide-pedestal quiescent H-mode. We present a hardware-accelerated machine learning (ML) inference system integrated into the RTSTAB processing node of the DIII-D real-time diagnostic and control infrastructure. The system uses an AMD/Xilinx KCU1500 FPGA to enable ultra low latency plasma state classification and ELM forecasting. Input features come from real-time Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES), and the ML model is implemented as a dense neural network using the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL).
  A key capability is SNL dynamic parameter loading, which allows on-the-fly updates of neural network weights and biases without hardware resynthesis. This enables multiple classification tasks on a single FPGA design and supports adaptive control strategies that respond to evolving plasma conditions. By decoupling inference from fixed-weight configurations, the system supports continuous model refinement and seamless task switching during live operation.
  The SNL-based inference engine is fully integrated with the FPGA in the DIII-D RTSTAB Plasma Control System (PCS), improving ELM avoidance, confinement, and operational stability. These results show the feasibility of embedding dynamically reconfigurable FPGA-based ML inference into real-time fusion diagnostic pipelines, providing a scalable and resilient path toward intelligent and autonomous plasma control in future magnetic confinement fusion devices.</description>

Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide insights into plasma behavior, including turbulence and confinement, which are essential for optimizing fusion reactor performance. Transitioning to exascale simulations introduces significant challenges, with traditional file input/output (I/O) inefficiencies remaining a key bottleneck. This work advances BIT1, an electrostatic PIC MC code, by improving the particle mover with OpenMP task-based parallelism, integrating the openPMD streaming API, and enabling in-memory data streaming with ADIOS2's Sustainable Staging Transport (SST) engine to enhance I/O performance, computational efficiency, and system storage utilization. We employ profiling tools such as gprof, perf, IPM and Darshan, which provide insights into computation, communication, and I/O operations. We implement time-dependent data checkpointing with the openPMD API enabling seamless data movement and in-situ visualization for real-time analysis without interrupting the simulation. We demonstrate improvements in simulation runtime, data accessibility and real-time insights by comparing traditional file I/O with the ADIOS2 BP4 and SST backends. The proposed hybrid BIT1 openPMD SST enhancement introduces a new paradigm for real-time scientific discovery in plasma simulations, enabling faster insights and more efficient use of exascale computing resources.</description>

Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>
