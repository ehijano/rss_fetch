      <title>An Efficient NVoD Scheme Using Implicit Error Correction and Subchannels for Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Error Correction (IEC) is a near Video-on-Demand (nVoD) scheme that trades bandwidth utilization for initial playback delay to potentially support an infinite number of users. Additionally, it provides error protection without any further bandwidth increase by exploiting the implicit redundancy of nVoD protocols, using linear combinations of the segments transmitted in a given time slot. However, IEC packet loss protection is weaker at the beginning of the playback due to the lack of implicit redundancy and lower decoding efficiency, resulting in worse subjective playback quality. In tackling this issue, this paper contributes with an extension of the original nVoD architecture, enhancing its performance by adding a new element namely, subchannels. These subdivisions of the original channels do not provide further packet loss protection but significantly improve the decoding efficiency, which in turn increases playback quality, especially at the beginning. Even for very high packet loss probabilities, subchannels are designed to obtain higher decoding efficiency which results in greater packet loss protection than that provided by IEC. The proposed scheme is especially useful in wireless cooperative networks using techniques such as network coding, as content transmissions can be split into different subchannels in order to maximize network efficiency.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Video Moment Retrieval via Off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The target of video moment retrieval (VMR) is predicting temporal spans within a video that semantically match a given linguistic query. Existing VMR methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) overly rely on expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. Although some recent studies introduce a zero-shot setting to avoid fine-tuning, they overlook inherent language bias in the query, leading to erroneous localization. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes Moment-GPT, a tuning-free pipeline for zero-shot VMR utilizing frozen MLLMs. Specifically, we first employ LLaMA-3 to correct and rephrase the query to mitigate language bias. Subsequently, we design a span generator combined with MiniGPT-v2 to produce candidate spans adaptively. Finally, to leverage the video comprehension capabilities of MLLMs, we apply VideoChatGPT and span scorer to select the most appropriate spans. Our proposed method substantially outperforms the state-ofthe-art MLLM-based and zero-shot models on several public datasets, including QVHighlights, ActivityNet-Captions, and Charades-STA.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Social Interactions Learning With Random Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical technology in the evolution of self-driving cars toward complete artificial intelligence. Over recent years, focusing on the trajectories of pedestrians to model their social interactions has surged with great interest in more accurate trajectory predictions. However, existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on pre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions. In this work, we propose a novel framework named DTGAN, which extends the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to graph sequence data, with the primary objective of automatically capturing implicit social interactions and achieving precise predictions of pedestrian trajectory. DTGAN innovatively incorporates random weights within each graph to eliminate the need for pre-defined interaction rules. We further enhance the performance of DTGAN by exploring diverse task loss functions during adversarial training, which yields improvements of 16.7\% and 39.3\% on metrics ADE and FDE, respectively. The effectiveness and accuracy of our framework are verified on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DTGAN achieves superior performance and is well able to understand pedestrians' intentions.</description>

      <title>Audio-visual Deepfake Detection With Local Temporal Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an audio-visual deepfake detection approach that aims to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies between audio and visual modalities. To achieve this, both architectural and data synthesis strategies are introduced. From an architectural perspective, a temporal distance map, coupled with an attention mechanism, is designed to capture these inconsistencies while minimizing the impact of irrelevant temporal subsequences. Moreover, we explore novel pseudo-fake generation techniques to synthesize local inconsistencies. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting audio-visual deepfakes.</description>
