      <title>Towards a Deterministic Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Insights from Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments violating Bell's inequality appear to indicate deterministic models do not correspond to a realistic theory of quantum mechanics. The theory of pilot waves seemingly overcomes this hurdle via nonlocality and statistical dependence, however it necessitates the existence of "ghost waves". This manuscript develops a deterministic dynamical system with local interactions. The aggregate behavior of the trajectories are reminiscent of a quantum particle evolving under the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and reminiscent of Feynman's path integral interpretation in three canonical examples: motion in free space, double slit diffraction, and superluminal barrier traversal. Moreover, the system bifurcates into various dynamical regimes including a classical limit. These results illustrate a deterministic alternative to probabilistic interpretations and aims to shed light on the transition from quantum to classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium quantum field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) for open quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment and apply it to the spin-boson model as an archetypical example where the environment is composed of a bosonic bath. Prior SKFT developments of this type have been confined to the Markovian regime, as an alternative to a conventional description by the Lindblad quantum master equation (QME) which is a time-local matrix differential equation. Here we combine SKFT with a two-particle irreducible (2PI) action that resums a class of Feynman diagrams to infinite order. We obtain the time-evolution of the spin density matrix in the form of a system of integro-differential equations applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The latter regime--where taking into account memory effects becomes essential--poses a challenge for standard methods when trying to incorporate arbitrary properties of the system, bath, and length of time evolution. The SKFT+2PI-computed time evolution of the spin expectation values in the Markovian regime reproduces the solution of the Lindblad QME, as long as the system-bath coupling in the latter is adjusted by increasing it. In the non-Markovian regime, SKFT+2PI yields a nonperturbative solution that mimics results from both hierarchical equations of motion and tensor networks methods that we employ as benchmarks. Our SKFT+2PI approach can also access challenging cases, such as zero-temperature and sub-Ohmic bath, as well as arbitrary long evolution times. Taking into account favorable numerical cost of solving the integro-differential equations with increasing number of spins, time steps or dimensionality the SKFT+2PI approach offers a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and spintronics in the presence of a variety of (single or multiple) dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Experimental Aspects of Indefinite Causal Order in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, the toolkit of quantum information has been expanded to include processes in which the basic operations do not have definite causal relations. Originally considered in the context of the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity, these causally indefinite processes have been shown to offer advantages in a wide variety of quantum information processing tasks, ranging from quantum computation to quantum metrology. Here we overview these advantages and the experimental efforts to realise them. We survey both the different experimental techniques employed, as well as theoretical methods developed in support of the experiments, before discussing the interpretations of current experimental results and giving an outlook on the future of the field.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Separations in Shallow-Circuit-Based Learning with and without Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum-classical separations between classical and quantum supervised learning models based on constant depth (i.e., shallow) circuits, in scenarios with and without noises. We construct a classification problem defined by a noiseless shallow quantum circuit and rigorously prove that any classical neural network with bounded connectivity requires logarithmic depth to output correctly with a larger-than-exponentially-small probability. This unconditional near-optimal quantum-classical separation originates from the quantum nonlocality property that distinguishes quantum circuits from their classical counterparts. We further derive the noise thresholds for demonstrating such a separation on near-term quantum devices under the depolarization noise model. We prove that this separation will persist if the noise strength is upper bounded by an inverse polynomial with respect to the system size, and vanish if the noise strength is greater than an inverse polylogarithmic function. In addition, for quantum devices with constant noise strength, we prove that no super-polynomial classical-quantum separation exists for any classification task defined by shallow Clifford circuits, independent of the structures of the circuits that specify the learning models.</description>

      <title>A Review of Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum computing offers a flexible computational paradigm with applications in diverse areas. However, a key obstacle to realizing their potential is the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm -- choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise -- can lead to BPs when ill-suited. Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of the BP phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermalization slowing down of a quantum many-body system upon approach to two distinct integrability limits. Motivated by previous studies of classical systems, we identify two thermalization time scales: one quantum Lyapunov time scale is extracted by quantifying operator growth in time in an appropriately defined basis, while another ergodization time scale is related to statistics of fluctuations of the time-evolved operator around its mean value based on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Using a paradigmatic Quantum Ising chain we find that both timescales diverge upon approach to integrability. The relative strength of the divergence of the scales depends on the particular integrable limit. This allows us to define two different universality classes of quantum thermalization: short- and long-range networks.</description>

      <title>Classically Spoofing System Linear Cross Entropy Score Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, several experimental groups have claimed demonstrations of ``quantum supremacy'' or computational quantum advantage. A notable first claim by Google Quantum AI revolves around a metric called the Linear Cross Entropy Benchmarking (Linear XEB), which has been used in multiple quantum supremacy experiments since. The complexity-theoretic hardness of spoofing Linear XEB has nevertheless been doubtful due to its dependence on the Cross-Entropy Quantum Threshold (XQUATH) conjecture put forth by Aaronson and Gunn, which has been disproven for sublinear depth circuits. In efforts on demonstrating quantum supremacy by quantum Hamiltonian simulation, a similar benchmarking metric called the System Linear Cross Entropy Score (sXES) holds firm in light of the aforementioned negative result due to its fundamental distinction with Linear XEB. Moreover, the hardness of spoofing sXES complexity-theoretically rests on the System Linear Cross-Entropy Quantum Threshold Assumption (sXQUATH), the formal relationship of which to XQUATH is unclear. Despite the promises that sXES offers for future demonstration of quantum supremacy, in this work we show that it is an unsound benchmarking metric. Particularly, we prove that sXQUATH does not hold for sublinear depth circuits and present a classical algorithm that spoofs sXES for experiments corrupted with noise larger than certain threshold.</description>

      <title>Classifying two-body Hamiltonians for Quantum Darwinism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism is a paradigm to understand how classically objective reality emerges from within a fundamentally quantum universe. Despite the growing attention that this field of research as been enjoying, it is currently not known what specific properties a given Hamiltonian describing a generic quantum system must have to allow the emergence of classicality. Therefore, in the present work, we consider a broadly applicable generic model of an arbitrary finite-dimensional system interacting with an environment formed from an arbitrary collection of finite-dimensional degrees of freedom via an unspecified, potentially time-dependent Hamiltonian containing at most two-body interaction terms. We show that such models support quantum Darwinism if the set of operators acting on the system which enter the Hamiltonian satisfy a set of commutation relations with a pointer observable and with one other. We demonstrate our results by analyzing a wide range of example systems: a qutrit interacting with a qubit environment, a qubit-qubit model with interactions alternating in time, and a series of collision models including a minimal model of a quantum Maxwell demon.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Routing using Quantum Error Correction for Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell-state measurement (BSM) on entangled states shared between quantum repeaters is the fundamental operation used to route entanglement in quantum networks. Performing BSMs on Werner states shared between repeaters leads to exponential decay in the fidelity of the end-to-end Werner state with the number of repeaters, necessitating entanglement distillation. Generally, entanglement routing protocols use \emph{probabilistic} distillation techniques based on local operations and classical communication. In this work, we use quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) for \emph{deterministic} entanglement distillation to route Werner states on a chain of repeaters. To maximize the end-to-end distillable entanglement, which depends on the number and fidelity of end-to-end Bell pairs, we utilize global link-state knowledge to determine the optimal policy for scheduling distillation and BSMs at the repeaters. We analyze the effect of the QECC's properties on the entanglement rate and the number of quantum memories. We observe that low-rate codes produce high-fidelity end-to-end states owing to their excellent error-correcting capability, whereas high-rate codes yield a larger number of end-to-end states but of lower fidelity. The number of quantum memories used at repeaters increases with the code rate as well as the classical computation time of the QECC's decoder.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up the Quantum Divide and Conquer Algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization as a field has largely been restricted by the constraints of current quantum computing hardware, as limitations on size, performance, and fidelity mean most non-trivial problem instances won't fit on quantum devices. Even proposed solutions such as distributed quantum computing systems may struggle to achieve scale due to the high cost of inter-device communication. To address these concerns, we propose Deferred Constraint Quantum Divide and Conquer Algorithm (DC-QDCA), a method for constructing quantum circuits which greatly reduces inter-device communication costs for some quantum graph optimization algorithms. This is achieved by identifying a set of vertices whose removal partitions the input graph, known as a separator; by manipulating the placement of constraints associated with the vertices in the separator, we can greatly simplify the topology of the optimization circuit, reducing the number of required inter-device operations. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative algorithm which builds on these techniques to find solutions for problems with potentially thousands of variables. Our experimental results using quantum simulators have shown that we can construct tractable circuits nearly three times the size of previous QDCA methods while retaining a similar or greater level of quality.</description>

      <title>SHARE: Secure Hardware Allocation and Resource Efficiency in Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) is poised to revolutionize problem solving across various fields, with research suggesting that systems with over 50 qubits may achieve quantum advantage surpassing supercomputers in certain optimization tasks. As the hardware size of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers continues to grow, Multi tenant computing (MTC) has emerged as a viable approach to enhance hardware utilization by allowing shared resource access across multiple quantum programs. However, MTC can also bring challenges and security concerns. This paper focuses on optimizing quantum hardware utilization in shared environments by implementing multi programming strategies that not only enhance hardware utilization but also effectively manage associated risks like crosstalk and fault injection. We propose a novel partitioning and allocation method called Community Based Dynamic Allocation Partitioning (COMDAP) and Secure COMDAP to refine and secure multi programming capabilities in quantum systems. COMDAP ensures equitable and efficient resource distribution, addresses the issues of suboptimal partitioning, and significantly improves hardware utilization. We report a 23 percent average improvement in hardware utilization rate compared to existing greedy heuristics, with rates averaging 92 percent. COMDAP introduces an average increase of approximately 0.05X in delta CX, alongside a 3.5 percent average reduction in PST across benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Implementing a synthetic magnetic vector potential in a 2D superconducting qubit array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a compelling platform for analog quantum simulation due to the precision control, fast operation, and site-resolved readout inherent to the hardware. Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here, we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys requisite properties of electromagnetism: a spatially-varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally-varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect--the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field--exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Controllability of the Periodic Quantum Ising Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a controllability analysis of the quantum Ising periodic chain of n spin 1/2 particles where the interpolating parameter between the two Hamiltonians plays the role of the control. A fundamental result in the control theory of quantum systems states that the set of achievable evolutions is (dense in) the Lie group corresponding to the Lie algebra generated by the Hamiltonians of the system. Such a dynamical Lie algebra therefore characterizes all the state transitions available for a given system. For the Ising spin periodic chain we characterize such a dynamical Lie algebra and therefore the set of all reachable states. In particular, we prove that the dynamical Lie algebra is a (3n-1)-dimensional Lie sub-algebra of su(2^n) which is a direct sum of a two dimensional center and a (3n-3)-dimensional semisimple Lie subalgebra. This in turn is the direct sum of n-1 Lie algebras isomorphic to su(2) parametrized by the eigenvalues of a fixed matrix. We display the basis for each of these Lie subalgebras. Therefore the problem of control for the Ising spin periodic chain is, modulo the two dimensional center, a problem of simultaneous control of n-1 spin 1/2 particles. In the process of proving this result, we develop some tools which are of general interest for the controllability analysis of quantum systems with symmetry.</description>

      <title>Generalized group designs: overcoming the 4-design-barrier and constructing novel unitary 2-designs in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary designs are essential tools in several quantum information protocols. Similarly to other design concepts, unitary designs are mainly used to facilitate averaging over a relevant space, in this case, the unitary group $\mathrm{U}(d)$. While it is known that exact unitary $t$-designs exist for any degree $t$ and dimension $d$, the most appealing type of designs, group designs (in which the elements of the design form a group), can provide at most $3$-designs. Moreover, even group $2$-designs can only exist in limited dimensions. In this paper, we present novel construction methods for creating exact generalized group designs based on the representation theory of the unitary group and its finite subgroups that overcome the $4$-design-barrier of unitary group designs. Furthermore, a construction is presented for creating generalized group $2$-designs in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different kinds of wave packet transforms are widely used for extracting multi-scale structures in signal processing tasks. This paper introduces the quantum circuit implementation of a broad class of wave packets, including Gabor atoms and wavelets, with compact frequency support. Our approach operates in the frequency space, involving reallocation and reshuffling of signals tailored for manipulation on quantum computers. The resulting implementation is different from the existing quantum algorithms for spatially compactly supported wavelets and can be readily extended to quantum transforms of other wave packets with compact frequency support.</description>

      <title>Efficient Internal Strategies in Quantum Relaxation based Branch-and-Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combinatorial optimization problem is to find an optimal solution under the constraints. This is one of the potential applications for quantum computers. Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO) is the quantum optimization algorithm that encodes multiple classical variables into a single qubit to construct a quantum Hamiltonian, thereby reducing the number of qubits required. The ground energy of the QRAO Hamiltonian provides a lower bound on the original problem's optimal value before encoding. This property allows the QRAO Hamiltonian to be used as a relaxation of the original problem, and it is thus referred to as a quantum relaxed Hamiltonian. In the Branch-and-Bound method, solving the relaxation problem plays a significant role. In this study, we developed Quantum Relaxation based Branch-and-Bound (QR-BnB), a method incorporating quantum relaxation into the Branch-and-Bound framework. We solved the MaxCut Problem and the Travelling Salesman Problem in our experiments. In all instances in this study, we obtained the optimal solution whenever we successfully computed the exact lower bound through quantum relaxation. Internal strategies, such as relaxation methods and variable selection, influence the convergence of the Branch-and-Bound. Thus, we have further developed the internal strategies for QR-BnB and examined how these strategies influence its convergence. We show that our variable selection strategy via the expectation value of the Pauli operators gives better convergence than the naive random choice. QRAO deals with only unconstrained optimization problems, but QR-BnB can handle constraints more flexibly because of the Branch-and-Bound processes on the classical computing part. We demonstrate that in our experiments with the Travelling Salesman Problem, the convergence of QR-BnB became more than three times faster by using the information in the constraints.</description>

      <title>A multidimensional approach to quantum state tomography of photoelectron wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in reconstructing the density matrix of photoionized electrons, in particular in complex systems where decoherence can be introduced either by a partial measurement of the system or through coupling with a stochastic environment. To this, end, several methods to reconstruct the density matrix, quantum state tomography protocols, have been developed and tested on photoelectrons ejected from noble gases following absorption of XUV photons from attosecond pulses. It remains a challenge to obtain model-free, single scan protocols that can reconstruct the density matrix with high fidelities. Current methods require extensive measurements or involve complex fitting of the signal. Faithful single-scan reconstructions would be of great help to increase the number of systems that can be studied. We propose a new and more efficient protocol - rainbow-KRAKEN - that is able to reconstruct the continuous variable density matrix of a photoelectron in a single time delay scan. It is based on measuring the coherences of a photoelectron created by absorption of an XUV pulse using a broadband IR probe that is scanned in time and a narrowband IR reference that is temporally fixed to the XUV pulse. We illustrate its performance for a Fano resonance in He as well as mixed states in Ar arising from spin-orbit splitting. We show that the protocol results in excellent fidelities and near-perfect estimation of the purity.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Realism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realism about quantum theory naturally leads to realism about the quantum state of the universe. It leaves open whether it is a pure state represented by a wave function, or an impure one represented by a density matrix. I characterize and elaborate on Density Matrix Realism, the thesis that the universal quantum state is objective but can be impure. To clarify the thesis, I compare it with Wave Function Realism, explain the conditions under which they are empirically equivalent, consider two generalizations of Density Matrix Realism, and answer some frequently asked questions. I end by highlighting an implication for scientific realism.</description>

      <title>Are we allowed to subtract accidental coincidences in experiments of photon correlations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subtracting accidental coincidences is a common practice quantum optics experiments. For zero mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed vacuum, we show that if one removes accidental coincidences the measurement results are quantitatively the same, both for photon coincidences at very low flux and for intensity covariances. Consequently, pure quantum effects at the photon level, like interference of photon wave functions or photon bunching, are reproduced in the correlation of fluctuations of macroscopic beams issued from spontaneous down conversion. This is true both in experiment if the detection resolution is smaller than the coherence cell (size of the mode), and in stochastic simulations based on sampling the Wigner function.
  We discuss the limitations of this correspondence, such as Bell inequalities (for which one cannot substract accidental coincidences), highly multimode situations such as quantum imaging, and higher order correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a dense and dipole-dipole coupled ensemble of two-level emitters interacting via their environmental thermostat is investigated. The static dipole-dipole interaction strengths are being considered strong enough but smaller than the transition frequency. Therefore, the established thermal equilibrium of ensemble's quantum dynamics is described with respect to the dipole-dipole coupling strengths. We have demonstrated the quantum nature of the spontaneously scattered light field in this process for weaker thermal baths as well as non-negligible dipole-dipole couplings compared to the emitter's transition frequency. Furthermore, the collectively emitted photon intensity suppresses or enhances depending on the environmental thermal baths intensities.</description>

      <title>Generic signalling-free white-noise limit for models of spontaneous unitarity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective collapse theories propose modifications to Schr\"odinger's equation that solve the quantum measurement problem by interpolating between microscopic quantum dynamics and projective evolution of macroscopic objects. Objective collapse theories extending the equilibrium description of spontaneous symmetry breaking to spontaneous violations of unitarity in quantum dynamics were recently shown to possess a physical white noise limit when applied to initial two-state superpositions. Here, we show the existence of a generic physical white noise limit for models of spontaneous unitarity violation applicable to any initial state. We show that in this limit, the emergence of Born rule statistics is enforced by a fluctuation-dissipation relation, and that the ensemble averaged probability densities follow the GKSL master equation corresponding to a linear quantum semi-group, guaranteeing the absence of superluminal signalling.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable quantum kernel method on a programmable photonic quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among various quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms, the quantum kernel method has especially attracted attention due to its compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and its potential to achieve quantum advantage. This method performs classification and regression by nonlinearly mapping data into quantum states in a higher dimensional Hilbert space. Thus far, the quantum kernel method has been implemented only on qubit-based systems, but continuous-variable (CV) systems can potentially offer superior computational power by utilizing its infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of the classification task with the CV quantum kernel method on a programmable photonic quantum processor. We experimentally prove that the CV quantum kernel method successfully classifies several datasets robustly even under the experimental imperfections, with high accuracies comparable to the classical kernel. This demonstration sheds light on the utility of CV quantum systems for QML and should stimulate further study in other CV QML algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a superquantization rule which indicates the possible robust stationary states of a generic driven-dissipative quantum system. Multistability in a driven cavity mode interacting with a qudit is revealed in this way within a simple intuitive picture. The accuracy of the superquantization approach is confirmed by numerical simulations of the underlying quantum model. In the case when the qudit is composed of several two-level emitters coupled homogeneously to the cavity, we demonstrate the robustness of the superquantized steady states to single-emitter decay.</description>

      <title>Multivariate trace estimation using quantum state space linear algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for approximating multivariate traces, i.e. the traces of matrix products. Our research is motivated by the extensive utility of multivariate traces in elucidating spectral characteristics of matrices, as well as by recent advancements in leveraging quantum computing for faster numerical linear algebra. Central to our approach is a direct translation of a multivariate trace formula into a quantum circuit, achieved through a sequence of low-level circuit construction operations. To facilitate this translation, we introduce \emph{quantum Matrix States Linear Algebra} (qMSLA), a framework tailored for the efficient generation of state preparation circuits via primitive matrix algebra operations. Our algorithm relies on sets of state preparation circuits for input matrices as its primary inputs and yields two state preparation circuits encoding the multivariate trace as output. These circuits are constructed utilizing qMSLA operations, which enact the aforementioned multivariate trace formula. We emphasize that our algorithm's inputs consist solely of state preparation circuits, eschewing harder to synthesize constructs such as Block Encodings. Furthermore, our approach operates independently of the availability of specialized hardware like QRAM, underscoring its versatility and practicality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of employing higher orders of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the evolution operator for more effective simulations of quantum systems on a noisy quantum computer is explored. By examining the transverse-field Ising model and the XY model, it is demonstrated that when the gate error is decreased by approximately an order of magnitude relative to typical modern values, higher-order Trotterization becomes advantageous. This form of Trotterization yields a global minimum of the overall simulation error, comprising both the mathematical error of Trotterization and the physical error arising from gate execution.</description>

      <title>Spanning Tree Matching Decoder for Quantum Surface Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the spanning tree matching (STM) decoder for surface codes, which guarantees the error correction capability up to the code's designed distance by first employing an instance of the minimum spanning tree on a subset of ancilla qubits within the lattice. Then, a perfect matching graph is simply obtained, by selecting the edges more likely to be faulty. A comparative analysis reveals that the STM decoder, at the cost of a slight performance degradation, provides a substantial advantage in decoding time compared to the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder. Finally, we propose an even more simplified and faster algorithm, the Rapid-Fire (RFire) decoder, designed for scenarios where decoding speed is a critical requirement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study quantum algorithms for Hopcroft's problem which is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. Given $n$ points and $n$ lines in the plane, the task is to determine whether there is a point-line incidence. The classical complexity of this problem is well-studied, with the best known algorithm running in $O(n^{4/3})$ time, with matching lower bounds in some restricted settings. Our results are two different quantum algorithms with time complexity $\widetilde O(n^{5/6})$. The first algorithm is based on partition trees and the quantum backtracking algorithm. The second algorithm uses a quantum walk together with a history-independent dynamic data structure for storing line arrangement which supports efficient point location queries. In the setting where the number of points and lines differ, the quantum walk-based algorithm is asymptotically faster. The quantum speedups for the aforementioned data structures may be useful for other geometric problems.</description>

      <title>Li\'{e}nard Type Nonlinear Oscillators and Quantum Solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li\'{e}nard-type nonlinear oscillators with linear and nonlinear damping terms exhibit diverse dynamical behavior in both the classical and quantum regimes. In this paper, we consider examples of various one-dimensional Li\'{e}nard type-I and type-II oscillators. The associated Euler-Lagrange equations are divided into groups based on the characteristics of the damping and forcing terms. The Li\'{e}nard type-I oscillators often display localized solutions, isochronous and non-isochronous oscillations and are also precisely solvable in quantum mechanics in general, where the ordering parameters play an important role. These include Mathews-Lakshmanan and Higgs oscillators. However, the classical solutions of some of the nonlinear oscillators are expressed in terms of elliptic functions and have been found to be quasi-exactly solvable in the quantum region. The three-dimensional generalizations of these classical systems add more degrees of freedom, which show complex dynamics. Their quantum equivalents are also explored in this article. The isotonic generalizations of the non-isochronous nonlinear oscillators have also been solved both classically and quantum mechanically to advance the studies. The modified Emden equation categorized as Li\'{e}nard type-II exhibits isochronous oscillations at the classical level. This property makes it a valuable tool for studying the underlying nonlinear dynamics. The study on the quantum counterpart of the system provides a deeper understanding of the behavior in the quantum realm as a typical PT-symmetric system.</description>

      <title>Dissipative phase transition: from qubits to qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of dissipative phase transitions in quantum many-body systems when the individual constituents are qudits ($d$-level systems) instead of qubits. As an example system, we employ a permutation-invariant $XY$ model of $N$ infinite-range interacting $d$-level spins undergoing individual and collective dissipation. In the mean-field limit, we identify a dissipative phase transition, whose critical point is independent of $d$ after a suitable rescaling of parameters. When the decay rates between all adjacent levels are identical and $d\geq 4$, the critical point expands, in terms of the ratio between dissipation and interaction strengths, to a critical region in which two phases coexist and which increases as $d$ grows. In addition, a larger $d$ leads to a more pronounced change in spin expectation values at the critical point. Numerical investigations for finite $N$ reveal symmetry breaking signatures in the Liouvillian spectrum at the phase transition. The phase transition is furthermore marked by maximum entanglement negativity and a significant purity change of the steady state, which become more pronounced as $d$ increases. Considering qudits instead of qubits thus opens new perspectives on accessing rich phase diagrams in open many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current era of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing, efficient digital simulation of quantum systems holds significant importance for quantum algorithm development, verification and validation. However, analysis of sparsity within these simulations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a novel observation regarding the prevalent sparsity patterns inherent in quantum circuits. We introduce DiaQ, a new sparse matrix format tailored to exploit this quantum-specific sparsity, thereby enhancing simulation performance. Our contribution extends to the development of libdiaq, a numerical library implemented in C++ with OpenMP for multi-core acceleration and SIMD vectorization, featuring essential mathematical kernels for digital quantum simulations. Furthermore, we integrate DiaQ with SV-Sim, a state vector simulator, yielding substantial performance improvements across various quantum circuits (e.g., ~26.67% for GHZ-28 and ~32.72% for QFT-29 with multi-core parallelization and SIMD vectorization on Frontier). Evaluations conducted on benchmarks from SupermarQ and QASMBench demonstrate that DiaQ represents a significant step towards achieving highly efficient quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse current in coupled (ICC) quantum transport, where one induced current opposes all thermodynamic forces of a system, is a highly counter-intuitive transport phenomenon. Using an exactly solvable model of strongly-coupled quantum dots, we present thermodynamic description of ICC in energy and spin-induced particle currents, with potential applications towards unconventional and autonomous nanoscale thermoelectric generators. Our analysis reveals the connection between microscopic and macroscopic formulations of entropy production rates, elucidating the often-overlooked role of proper thermodynamic forces and conjugate fluxes in characterizing genuine ICC. In our model, the seemingly paradoxical results of ICC in the energy current arise from chemical work done by current-carrying quantum particles, while in spin-induced particle current, it stems from the relative competition between electron reservoirs controlling one particular transition.</description>

Abstract: The quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) methodology was developed to overcome a critical issue as regards non-unitarity in the implementation of imaginary time evolution on a quantum computer. QITE has since been used to approximate ground states of various physical systems. In this paper, we demonstrate a practical application of QITE as a quantum numerical solver for linear partial differential equations. Our algorithm takes inspiration from QITE in that the quantum state follows the same normalised trajectory in both algorithms. However, it is our QITE methodology's ability to track the scale of the state vector over time that allows our algorithm to solve differential equations. We demonstrate our methodology with numerical simulations and use it to solve the heat equation in one and two dimensions using six and ten qubits, respectively.</description>

      <title>How much entanglement is needed for quantum error correction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that logical states of quantum error-correcting codes have to be highly entangled such that codes capable of correcting more errors require more entanglement to encode a qubit. Here we show that this belief may or may not be true depending on a particular code. To this end, we characterize a tradeoff between the code distance $d$ quantifying the number of correctable errors, and geometric entanglement of logical states quantifying their maximal overlap with product states or more general "topologically trivial" states. The maximum overlap is shown to be exponentially small in $d$ for three families of codes: (1) low-density parity check (LDPC) codes with commuting check operators, (2) stabilizer codes, and (3) codes with a constant encoding rate. Equivalently, the geometric entanglement of any logical state of these codes grows at least linearly with $d$. On the opposite side, we also show that this distance-entanglement tradeoff does not hold in general. For any constant $d$ and $k$ (number of logical qubits), we show there exists a family of codes such that the geometric entanglement of some logical states approaches zero in the limit of large code length.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Expansion Algorithm and complete analytical solution for the Hulth\'en and anharmonic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algorithm for providing analytical solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger's equation with non-exactly solvable potentials is elaborated. It represents a symbiosis between the logarithmic expansion method and the techniques of the superymmetric quantum mechanics as extended toward non shape invariant potentials. The complete solution to a given Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ is obtained from the nodeless states of the Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ and of a set of supersymmetric partners $H_{1}, H_{2},..., H_{r}$. The nodeless states (dubbed "edge" states) are unique and in general can be ground or excited states. They are solved using the logarithmic expansion which yields an infinite systems of coupled first order hierarchical differential equations, converted later into algebraic equations with recurrence relations which can be solved order by order. We formulate the aforementioned scheme, termed to as "Supersymmetric Expansion Algorithm'' step by step and apply it to obtain for the first time the complete analytical solutions of the three dimensional Hulth\'en--, and the one-dimensional anharmonic oscillator potentials.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Annealers with Near-Optimal Minor-Embedded Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking Quantum Process Units (QPU) at an application level usually requires considering the whole programming stack of the quantum computer. One critical task is the minor-embedding (resp. transpilation) step, which involves space-time overheads for annealing-based (resp. gate-based) quantum computers. This paper establishes a new protocol to generate graph instances with their associated near-optimal minor-embedding mappings to D-Wave Quantum Annealers (QA). This set of favorable mappings is used to generate a wide diversity of optimization problem instances. We use this method to benchmark QA on large instances of unconstrained and constrained optimization problems and compare the performance of the QPU with efficient classical solvers. The benchmark aims to evaluate and quantify the key characteristics of instances that could benefit from the use of a quantum computer. In this context, existing QA seem best suited for unconstrained problems on instances with densities less than $10\%$. For constrained problems, the penalty terms used to encode the hard constraints restrict the performance of QA and suggest that these QPU will be less efficient on these problems of comparable size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangling photons is a critical challenge for photonic quantum information processing: entanglement is a crucial resource for quantum communication and computation but can only be performed in a probabilistic manner when using linear optics. In this work, we leverage a two-photon state matrix representation to derive necessary and sufficient conditions on two-photon entangling operations with linear optics. We give a characterization of the input photonic states that can be used to prepare arbitrary two-qudit states in d-rail encoding with post-selection. We determine how many auxiliary photons are required to prepare any two-photon state with heralding. In addition, we present a construction for generalized post-selected n-qubit control-rotation gates.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum states of continuous variable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography with rigorous guarantees with respect to the trace distance, the most operationally meaningful metric for distinguishing quantum states, has been studied extensively for finite-dimensional systems; however, it remains almost unexplored for continuous variable systems. This work fills this gap. We prove that learning energy-constrained $n$-mode states without any additional prior assumption is extremely inefficient: The minimum number of copies needed for achieving an $\varepsilon$-approximation in trace distance scales as $\sim \varepsilon^{-2n}$, in stark contrast to the $n$-qudit case, where the $\varepsilon$-scaling is $\sim \varepsilon^{-2}$. Specifically, we find the optimal sample complexity of tomography of energy-constrained pure states, thereby establishing the ultimate achievable performance of tomography of continuous variable systems. Given such an extreme inefficiency, we then investigate whether more structured, yet still physically interesting, classes of quantum states can be efficiently tomographed. We rigorously prove that this is indeed the case for Gaussian states, a result previously assumed but never proved in the literature. To accomplish this, we establish bounds on the trace distance between two Gaussian states in terms of the norm distance of their first and second moments, which constitute technical tools of independent interest. This allows us to answer a fundamental question for the field of Gaussian quantum information: by estimating the first and second moments of an unknown Gaussian state with precision $\varepsilon$, what is the resulting trace distance error on the state? Lastly, we show how to efficiently learn $t$-doped Gaussian states, i.e., states prepared by Gaussian unitaries and at most $t$ local non-Gaussian evolutions, unveiling more of the structure of these slightly-perturbed Gaussian systems.</description>

      <title>Digital-Analog Counterdiabatic Quantum Optimization with Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hardware-specific, problem-dependent digital-analog quantum algorithm of a counterdiabatic quantum dynamics tailored for optimization problems. Specifically, we focus on trapped-ion architectures, taking advantage from global M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates as the analog interactions complemented by digital gates, both of which are available in the state-of-the-art technologies. We show an optimal configuration of analog blocks and digital steps leading to a substantial reduction in circuit depth compared to the purely digital approach. This implies that, using the proposed encoding, we can address larger optimization problem instances, requiring more qubits, while preserving the coherence time of current devices. Furthermore, we study the minimum gate fidelity required by the analog blocks to outperform the purely digital simulation, finding that it is below the best fidelity reported in the literature. To validate the performance of the digital-analog encoding, we tackle the maximum independent set problem, showing that it requires fewer resources compared to the digital case. This hybrid co-design approach paves the way towards quantum advantage for efficient solutions of quantum optimization problems.</description>

      <title>On-demand shaped photon emission based on a parametrically modulated qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures, to realize a long-range quantum network mediated by flying photon, it is necessary to shape the temporal profile of emitted photons to achieve high transfer efficiency between two quantum nodes. In this work, we demonstrate a new single-rail and dual-rail time-bin shaped photon generator without additional flux-tunable elements, which can act as a quantum interface of a point-to-point quantum network. In our approach, we adopt a qubit-resonator-transmission line configuration, and the effective coupling strength between the qubit and the resonator can be varied by parametrically modulating the qubit frequency. In this way, the coupling is directly proportional to the parametric modulation amplitude and covers a broad tunable range beyond 20 MHz for the sample we used. Additionally, when emitting shaped photons, we find that the spurious frequency shift (-0.4 MHz) due to parametric modulation is small and can be readily calibrated through chirping. We develop an efficient photon field measurement setup based on the data stream processing of GPU. Utilizing this system, we perform photon temporal profile measurement, quantum state tomography of photon field, and quantum process tomography of single-rail quantum state transfer based on a heterodyne measurement scheme. The single-rail encoding state transfer fidelity of shaped photon emission is 90.32%, and that for unshaped photon is 97.20%, respectively. We believe that the fidelity of shaped photon emission is mainly limited by the qubit coherence time. The results demonstrate that our method is hardware efficient, simple to implement, and scalable. It could become a viable tool in a high-quality quantum network utilizing both single-rail and dual-rail time-bin encoding.</description>

      <title>Saturation of the Multiparameter Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound at the Single-Copy Level with Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum parameter estimation theory is an important component of quantum information theory and provides the statistical foundation that underpins important topics such as quantum system identification and quantum waveform estimation. When there is more than one parameter the ultimate precision in the mean square error given by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound is not necessarily achievable. For non-full rank quantum states, it was not known when this bound can be saturated (achieved) when only a single copy of the quantum state encoding the unknown parameters is available. This single-copy scenario is important because of its experimental/practical tractability. Recently, necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound in the multiparameter single-copy scenario have been established in terms of i) the commutativity of a set of projected symmetric logarithmic derivatives and ii) the existence of a unitary solution to a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. New sufficient conditions were also obtained that only depend on properties of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives. In this paper, key structural properties of optimal measurements that saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound are illuminated. These properties are exploited to i) show that the sufficient conditions are in fact necessary and sufficient for an optimal measurement to be projective, ii) give an alternative proof of previously established necessary conditions, and iii) describe general POVMs, not necessarily projective, that saturate the multiparameter QCRB. Examples are given where a unitary solution to the system of nonlinear partial differential equations can be explicitly calculated when the required conditions are fulfilled.</description>

      <title>A Formulation of Quantum Fluid Mechanics and Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formalism of classical mechanics is given for time-dependent many-body states of quantum mechanics, describing both fluid flow and point mass trajectories. The familiar equations of energy, motion, and those of Lagrangian mechanics are obtained. An energy and continuity equation is demonstrated to be equivalent to the real and imaginary parts of the time dependent Schroedinger equation, respectively, where the Schroedinger equation is in density matrix form. For certain stationary states, using Lagrangian mechanics and a Hamiltonian function for quantum mechanics, equations for point-mass trajectories are obtained. For 1-body states and fluid flows, the energy equation and equations of motion are the Bernoulli and Euler equations of fluid mechanics, respectively. Generalizations of the energy and Euler equations are derived to obtain equations that are in the same form as they are in classical mechanics. The fluid flow type is compressible, inviscid, irrotational, with the nonclassical element of local variable mass. Over all space mass is conserved. The variable mass is a necessary condition for the fluid flow to agree with the zero orbital angular momentum for s states of hydrogen. Cross flows are examined, where velocity directions are changed without changing the kinetic energy. For one-electron atoms, the velocity modification gives closed orbits for trajectories, and mass conservation, vortexes, and density stratification for fluid flows. For many body states, Under certain conditions, and by hypotheses, Euler equations of orbital-flows are obtained. One-body Schroedinger equations that are a generalization of the Hartree-Fock equations are also obtained. These equations contain a quantum Coulomb's law, involving the 2-body pair function of reduced density matrix theory that replace the charge densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory for multiphoton qubit-resonator interactions enhanced by a qubit drive. The interactions generate qubit-conditional operations in the resonator when the driving is near $n$-photon cross-resonance, namely, the qubit drive is $n$-times the resonator frequency. We pay special attention to the strong driving regime, where the interactions are conditioned on the qubit dressed states. We consider the specific case where $n=2$, which results in qubit-conditional squeezing (QCS). We propose to use the QCS protocol for amplifying resonator displacements and their superpositions. We find the QCS protocol to generate a superposition of orthogonally squeezed states following a properly chosen qubit measurement. We outline quantum information processing applications for these states, including encoding a qubit in a resonator and performing a quantum non-demolition measurement of the qubit inferred from the resonator's second statistical moment. Next, we employ a two-tone drive to engineer an effective $n$-photon Rabi Hamiltonian in any desired coupling regime. In other words, the effective coupling strengths can be tuned over a wide range, thus allowing for the realization of new regimes that have so far been inaccessible. Finally, we propose a multiphoton circuit QED implementation based on a transmon qubit coupled to a resonator via an asymmetric SQUID. We provide realistic parameter estimates for the two-photon operation regime that can host the aforementioned two-photon protocols. We use numerical simulations to show that even in the presence of spurious terms and decoherence, our analytical predictions are robust.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Fixed Points of Quantum Channels and Application to Approximate Quantum Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a quantum channel and a state which satisfy a fixed point equation approximately (say, up to an error $\varepsilon$), can one find a new channel and a state, which are respectively close to the original ones, such that they satisfy an exact fixed point equation? It is interesting to ask this question for different choices of constraints on the structures of the original channel and state, and requiring that these are also satisfied by the new channel and state. We affirmatively answer the above question, under fairly general assumptions on these structures, through a compactness argument. Additionally, for channels and states satisfying certain specific structures, we find explicit upper bounds on the distances between the pairs of channels (and states) in question. When these distances decay quickly (in a particular, desirable manner) as $\varepsilon\to 0$, we say that the original approximate fixed point equation is rapidly fixable. We establish rapid fixability, not only for general quantum channels, but also when the original and new channels are both required to be unitary, mixed unitary or unital. In contrast, for the case of bipartite quantum systems with channels acting trivially on one subsystem, we prove that approximate fixed point equations are not rapidly fixable. In this case, the distance to the closest channel (and state) which satisfy an exact fixed point equation can depend on the dimension of the quantum system in an undesirable way. We apply our results on approximate fixed point equations to the question of robustness of quantum Markov chains (QMC) and establish the following: For any tripartite quantum state, there exists a dimension-dependent upper bound on its distance to the set of QMCs, which decays to zero as the conditional mutual information of the state vanishes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing issue in mathematical finance is the speed-up of pricing options, especially multi-asset options. A recent study has proposed to use tensor train learning algorithms to speed up Fourier transform (FT)-based option pricing, utilizing the ability of tensor networks to compress high-dimensional tensors. Another usage of the tensor network is to compress functions, including their parameter dependence. In this study, we propose a pricing method, where, by a tensor learning algorithm, we build tensor trains that approximate functions appearing in FT-based option pricing with their parameter dependence and efficiently calculate the option price for the varying input parameters. As a benchmark test, we run the proposed method to price a multi-asset option for the various values of volatilities and present asset prices. We show that, in the tested cases involving up to about 10 assets, the proposed method is comparable to or outperforms Monte Carlo simulation with $10^5$ paths in terms of computational complexity, keeping the comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative signatures of fractons in the twisted multi-flavor Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge-field configurations with non-trivial topology have profound consequences for the physics of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Over time, arguments have been gathering for the existence of gauge-field configurations with fractional topological charge, called fractons. Ground-state properties of gauge theories can drastically change in presence of fractons in the path integral. However, understanding the origin of such fractons is usually restricted to semi-classical argumentation. Here, we show that fractons persist in strongly correlated many-body systems, using the multiflavor Schwinger model of quantum electrodynamics as a paradigm example. Through detailed numerical tensor-network analysis, we find strong fracton signatures even in highly discretized lattice models, at sizes that are implementable on already existing quantum-simulation devices. Our work sheds light on how the non-trivial topology of gauge theories persists in challenging non-perturbative regimes, and it shows a path forward to probing it in table-top experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a new research field combining quantum information science and machine learning. Quantum computing technologies seem to be particularly well suited to solving problems in the health sector in an efficient way, because they may deal with large datasets more efficiently than classical AI.
  Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that mostly affects elderly people, causing important cognitive impairments. It is the most common cause of dementia and it has an effect on memory, thought, learning abilities and movement control. This type of disease has no cure, consequently an early diagnosis is fundamental for reducing its impact. The analysis of handwriting can be effective for diagnosing, as many researches have conjectured. The DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset contains handwriting samples from people affected by Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy people. Here we apply quantum AI to this use-case. In particular, we use this dataset to test kernel methods for classification task and compare their performances with the ones obtained via quantum machine learning methods. We find that quantum and classical algorithms achieve similar performances and in some cases quantum methods perform even better.
  Our results pave the way for future new quantum machine learning applications in early-screening diagnostics in the healthcare domain.</description>

Abstract: From the quasisymmetry-group perspective [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 120604 (2021)], we show the universal existence of collective, coherent modes of excitations with small momenta in many-body scar models in the degenerate limit, where the energy spacing in the scar tower vanishes. The number of these modes, as well as the quantum numbers carried by them, are given, not by the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, but by the quasisymmetry of the scar tower: hence the name quasi-Goldstone modes. Based on this, we draw a concrete analogy between the paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the many-body scar physics in the degenerate limit.</description>

      <title>Decoherence by warm horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently Danielson, Satishchandran, and Wald (DSW) have shown that quantum superpositions held outside of Killing horizons will decohere at a steady rate. This occurs because of the inevitable radiation of soft photons (gravitons), which imprint a electromagnetic (gravitational) ``which-path'' memory onto the horizon. Rather than appealing to this global description, an experimenter ought to also have a local description for the cause of decoherence. One might intuitively guess that this is just the bombardment of Hawking/Unruh radiation on the system, however simple calculations challenge this idea -- the same superposition held in a finite temperature inertial laboratory does not decohere at the DSW rate. In this work we provide a local description of the decoherence by mapping the DSW set-up onto a worldline-localized model resembling an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector. We present an interpretation in terms of random local forces which do not sufficiently self-average over long times. Using the Rindler horizon as a concrete example we clarify the crucial role of temperature, and show that the Unruh effect is the only quantum mechanical effect underlying these random forces. A general lesson is that for an environment which induces Ohmic friction on the central system (as one gets from the classical Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force, in an accelerating frame) the fluctuation-dissipation theorem implies that when this environment is at finite temperature it will cause steady decoherence on the central system. Our results agree with DSW and provide the complementary local perspective.</description>

      <title>QSimPy: A Learning-centric Simulation Framework for Quantum Cloud Resource Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm that allows seamless access to quantum hardware as cloud-based services. However, effective use of quantum resources is challenging and necessitates robust simulation frameworks for effective resource management design and evaluation. To address this need, we proposed QSimPy, a novel discrete-event simulation framework designed with the main focus of facilitating learning-centric approaches for quantum resource management problems in cloud environments. Underpinned by extensibility, compatibility, and reusability principles, QSimPy provides a lightweight simulation environment based on SimPy, a well-known Python-based simulation engine for modeling dynamics of quantum cloud resources and task operations. We integrate the Gymnasium environment into our framework to support the creation of simulated environments for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning-based techniques for optimizing quantum cloud resource management. The QSimPy framework encapsulates the operational intricacies of quantum cloud environments, supporting research in dynamic task allocation and optimization through DRL approaches. We also demonstrate the use of QSimPy in developing reinforcement learning policies for quantum task placement problems, demonstrating its potential as a useful framework for future quantum cloud research.</description>

      <title>Optically detected magnetic resonance study of thermal effects due to absorbing environment around nitrogen-vacancy-nanodiamond powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implanted Fe$^+$ ions in nanodiamond (ND) powder containing negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers and studied their Raman spectra and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) in various applied magnetic fields with green light (532 nm) excitation. In Raman spectra, we observed a blue shift of the NV$^-$ peak associated with the conversion of the electronic sp$^3$ configuration to the disordered sp$^2$ one typical for the carbon/graphite structure. In the ODMR spectra, we observed a red shift of the resonance position caused by local heating by an absorptive environment that recovers after annealing. To reveal the red shift mechanism in ODMR, we created a controlled absorptive environment around ND by adding iron-based Fe$_2$O$_3$ and graphitic sp$^2$ powders to the ND suspension. This admixture caused a substantial increase in the observed shift proportional to the applied laser power, corresponding to an increase in the local temperature by 150-180 K. This surprisingly large shift is absent in non-irradiated NV-ND powders, is associated only with the modification of the local temperature by the absorptive environment of NV-NDs and can be studied using ODMR signals of NV$^-$.</description>

      <title>Tomography of a single-atom-resolved detector in the presence of shot-to-shot number fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomography of single-particle-resolved detectors is of primary importance for characterizing particle correlations with applications in quantum metrology, quantum simulation and quantum computing. However, it is a non-trivial task in practice due to the unavoidable presence of noise that affects the measurement but does not originate from the detector. In this work, we address this problem for a three-dimensional single-atom-resolved detector where shot-to-shot atom number fluctuations are a central issue to perform a quantum detector tomography. We overcome this difficulty by exploiting the parallel measurement of counting statistics in sub-volumes of the detector, from which we evaluate the effect of shot-to-shot fluctuations and perform a local tomography of the detector. In addition, we illustrate the validity of our method from applying it to Gaussian quantum states with different number statistics. Finally, we show that the response of Micro-Channel Plate detectors is well-described from using a binomial distribution with the detection efficiency as a single parameter.</description>

      <title>Breaking and trapping Cooper pairs by Rydberg-molecule spectroscopy in atomic Fermi superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a spectroscopic probe of the breaking and localization of Cooper pairs in an atomic Fermi superfluid interacting with a Rydberg impurity. This is achieved by monitoring the formation of diatomic and triatomic ultralong-range molecular species in the superfluid across the BCS - Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. The triatomic Rydberg molecule in the BEC regime heralds the trapping of a tightly-bound Cooper pair, reminiscent of pion capture in nuclear matter, while the breaking of a Cooper pair on the BCS side by a diatomic Rydberg molecule is evocative of binary-star tidal disruption by a black hole. Spectroscopy of the Fermi superfluid and Rydberg molecules allows for an estimation of the Cooper-pair size while the Rydberg molecule binding energies discern many-body pairing effects.</description>

      <title>Inflationary complexity of thermal state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the inflationary complexity of the two-mode squeezed state with thermal effect for the single field inflation, modified dispersion relation, and non-trivial sound speed with the method of closed system and open system, respectively, which our analysis is valid for most inflationary models. First, the numeric of Krylov complexity in the method of the closed system indicates that the evolution of Krylov complexity highly depends on the squeezed angle parameter once taking the thermal effect into account, which will decay into some very tiny values, but the Krylov complexity will always enhance without thermal effect. For comparison, the numeric of circuit complexity shows that the evolution is always increasing no matter whether there are thermal effects or not which is independent of the evolution of squeezed angle parameter. By utilizing the method of open system, we first construct the wave function. As for the Krylov complexity with the method of open system, our investigations show the evolution of Krylov complexity will enhance upon some peaks factoring in the thermal effects. For completeness, we also calculate the Krylov entropy in the method of closed system and open system, which indicates that the hotter universe, the more chaotic the universe. Furthermore, our derivation for the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover into the case of closed system under weak dissipative approximation, which confirms the validity of construction for the wave function. Finally, our numeric of Lanczos coefficient shows that the non-trivial sound speed has minimal chaos compared to the other two cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculation of observables with three-dimensional projected entangled pair states is generally hard, as it requires a contraction of complex multi-layer tensor networks. We utilize the multi-layer structure of these tensor networks to largely simplify the contraction. The proposed approach involves the usage of the layer structure both to simplify the search for the boundary projected entangled pair states and the single-layer mapping of the final corner transfer matrix renormalization group contraction. We benchmark our results on the cubic lattice Heisenberg model, reaching the bond dimension D = 7, and find a good agreement with the previous results.</description>

Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme for a non-Hermitian atomic grating within an ultra-cold rubidium-87 ($^{87}Rb$) atomic ensemble. The grating's diffraction properties depend on the polarization states of incident photons and are controlled non-locally through Rydberg interactions. Multiple types of polarization-dependent diffraction modes are generated, benefiting from no crosstalk atomic transition channels based on transition selection rules. Those polarization-dependent diffraction modes can be switched using dynamic optical pulse trains, exploiting the Rydberg blockade effect, and are tunable by non-Hermitian optical modulation. Our work will advance the application of asymmetric optical scattering by utilizing the polarization degree of freedom within continuous media and benefit the application of versatile non-Hermitian/asymmetric optical devices.</description>

Abstract: We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large lengthscales, in a homogeneous 2D Bose gas driven isotropically on a lengthscale much smaller than its size. Starting with an equilibrium condensed gas, at long drive times we observe a nonthermal steady state. At increasing lengthscales, starting from the forcing one, the steady-state momentum distribution features in turn: (i) a power-law spectrum, with an exponent close to the analytical result for a particle cascade in weak-wave turbulence, and (ii) a spectrum intriguingly reminiscent of a nonthermal fixed point associated with universal coarsening in an isolated 2D gas. In further experiments, based on anisotropic driving, we also reveal the qualitative picture of the cascade-formation dynamics.</description>

      <title>New additivity properties of the relative entropy of entanglement and its generalizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the relative entropy of entanglement is additive when \emph{at least one of the two states} belongs to some specific class. We show that these classes include bipartite pure, maximally correlated, GHZ, Bell diagonal, isotropic, and generalized Dicke states. Previously, additivity was established only if \textit{both} states belong to the same class. Moreover, we extend these results to entanglement monotones based on the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropy. Notably, this family of monotones includes also the generalized robustness of entanglement and the geometric measure of entanglement. In addition, we prove that any monotone based on a quantum relative entropy is not additive for general states. We also compute closed-form expressions of the monotones for bipartite pure, Bell diagonal, isotropic, generalized Werner, generalized Dicke, and maximally correlated Bell diagonal states. Our results rely on developing a method that allows us to recast the initial convex optimization problem into a simpler linear one. Even though we mostly focus on entanglement theory, we expect that some of our technical results could be useful in investigating more general convex optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of unitary synthesis is to find a gate sequence that optimally approximates a target unitary transformation. A new synthesis approach, called probabilistic synthesis, has been introduced, and its superiority has been demonstrated over traditional deterministic approaches with respect to approximation error and gate length. However, the optimality of current probabilistic synthesis algorithms is unknown. We obtain the tight lower bound on the approximation error obtained by the optimal probabilistic synthesis, which guarantees the sub-optimality of current algorithms. We also show its tight upper bound, which improves and unifies current upper bounds depending on the class of target unitaries. These two bounds reveal the fundamental relationship of approximation error between probabilistic approximation and deterministic approximation of unitary transformations. From a computational point of view, we show that the optimal probability distribution can be computed by the semidefinite program (SDP) we construct. We also construct an efficient probabilistic synthesis algorithm for single-qubit unitaries, rigorously estimate its time complexity, and show that it reduces the approximation error quadratically compared with deterministic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback control of a two-atom network closed by a semi-infinite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a coherent feedback network where two two-level atoms are coupled with a semi-infinite waveguide. In this set-up, the two-level atoms can work as the photon source, and the photons can be emitted into the waveguide via the nonchiral or chiral couplings between the atom and the waveguide, according to whether the coupling strengths between the atoms and different directional propagating modes in the waveguide are identical or not. For the photon emitted by one of the two atoms, it can be reflected by the terminal mirror, or interact with the other atom, and then the photon can re-interact with the former atom. When the two atoms are both initially excited, finally there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide via the spontaneous emission and feedback interactions, and this is influenced by the locations of the atoms and the chirality of the coupling between the atom and the waveguide. Similarly, if only one of the two atoms is initially excited, there can be zero or one photon in the waveguide. Thus we can control the number of the photons in the waveguide and the atomic states by tuning the feedback loop length and the chiral couplings between the atom and waveguide. The photonic state in the waveguide is analyzed in the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions can be better understood based on the comprehensive analysis in these two domains.</description>

Abstract: Hypergraph product codes are a promising avenue to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation with constant overhead. When embedding these and other constant-rate qLDPC codes into 2D, a significant number of nonlocal connections are required, posing difficulties for some quantum computing architectures. In this work, we introduce a fault-tolerance scheme that aims to alleviate the effects of implementing this nonlocality by measuring generators acting on spatially distant qubits less frequently than those which do not. We investigate the performance of a simplified version of this scheme, where the measured generators are randomly selected. When applied to hypergraph product codes and a modified small-set-flip decoding algorithm, we prove that for a sufficiently high percentage of generators being measured, a threshold still exists. We also find numerical evidence that the logical error rate is exponentially suppressed even when a large constant fraction of generators are not measured.</description>

Abstract: We develop a hardware-efficient ansatz for variational optimization, derived from existing ansatze in the literature, that parametrizes subsets of all interactions in the Cost Hamiltonian in each layer. We treat gate orderings as a variational parameter and observe that doing so can provide significant performance boosts in experiments. We carried out experimental runs of a compilation-optimized implementation of fully-connected Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonians on a 50-qubit linear-chain subsystem of Rigetti Aspen-M-3 transmon processor. Our results indicate that, for the best circuit designs tested, the average performance at optimized angles and gate orderings increases with circuit depth (using more parameters), despite the presence of a high level of noise. We report performance significantly better than using a random guess oracle for circuits involving up to approx 5000 two-qubit and approx 5000 one-qubit native gates. We additionally discuss various takeaways of our results toward more effective utilization of current and future quantum processors for optimization.</description>

      <title>Single-photon induced instabilities in a cavity electromechanical device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity-electromechanical systems are extensively used for sensing and controlling the vibrations of mechanical resonators down to their quantum limit. The nonlinear radiation-pressure interaction in these systems could result in an unstable response of the mechanical resonator showing features such as frequency-combs, period-doubling bifurcations and chaos. However, due to weak light-matter interaction, typically these effects appear at very high driving strengths. By using polariton modes formed by a strongly coupled flux-tunable transmon and a microwave cavity, here we demonstrate an electromechanical device and achieve a single-photon coupling rate $g_0/2\pi$ of $160~$kHz, which is nearly 4\% of the mechanical frequency $\omega_m$. Due to large $g_0/\omega_m$ ratio, the device shows an unstable mechanical response resulting in frequency combs in sub-single photon limit. We systematically investigate the boundary of the unstable response and identify two important regimes governed by the optomechanical backaction and the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic mode. Such an improvement in the single-photon coupling rate and the observations of microwave frequency combs at single-photon levels may have applications in the quantum control of the motional states and critical parametric sensing. Our experiments strongly suggest the requirement of newer approaches to understand instabilities.</description>

      <title>Estimation with ultimate quantum precision of the transverse displacement between two photons via two-photon interference sampling measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum sensing scheme achieving the ultimate quantum sensitivity in the estimation of the transverse displacement between two photons interfering at a balanced beam splitter, based on transverse-momentum sampling measurements at the output. This scheme can possibly lead to enhanced high-precision nanoscopic techniques, such as super-resolved single-molecule localization microscopy with quantum dots, by circumventing the requirements in standard direct imaging of cameras resolution at the diffraction limit, and of highly magnifying objectives. Interestingly, we show that our interferometric technique achieves the ultimate spatial precision in nature irrespectively of the overlap of the two displaced photonic wavepackets, while its precision is only reduced of a constant factor for photons differing in any non-spatial degrees of freedom. This opens a new research paradigm based on the interface between spatially resolved quantum interference and quantum-enhanced spatial sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: The role of CP-indivisibility and incompatibility as valuable resources for various information-theoretic tasks is widely acknowledged. This study delves into the intricate relationship between CP-divisibility and channel compatibility. Our investigation focuses on the behaviour of incompatibility robustness of quantum channels for a pair of generic dynamical maps. We show that the incompatibility robustness of channels is monotonically non-increasing for a pair of generic CP-divisible dynamical maps. Further, our explicit study of the behaviour of incompatibility robustness with time for some specific dynamical maps reveals non-monotonic behaviour in the CP-indivisible regime. Additionally, we propose a measure of CP-indivisibility based on the incompatibility robustness of quantum channels. Our investigation provides valuable insights into the nature of quantum dynamical maps and their relevance in information-theoretic applications.</description>

      <title>Finite Pulse-Time Effects in Long-Baseline Quantum Clock Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-clock interferometry has been suggested as a quantum probe to test the universality of free fall (UFF) and the universality of gravitational redshift (UGR). In typical experimental schemes it seems advantageous to employ Doppler-free E1-M1 transitions which have so far been investigated in quantum gases at rest. Here, we consider the fully quantized atomic degrees of freedom and study the interplay of the quantum center-of-mass (COM) $-$ that can become delocalized $-$ together with the internal clock transitions. In particular, we derive a model for finite-time E1-M1 transitions with atomic intern-extern coupling and arbitrary position-dependent laser intensities. We further provide generalizations to the ideal expressions for perturbed recoilless clock pulses. Finally, we show at the example of a Gaussian laser beam that the proposed quantum-clock interferometers are stable against perturbations from varying optical fields for a sufficiently small quantum delocalization of the atomic COM.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Measurement of Neutral Atom Qubits with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate qubit state measurements assisted by a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) in a neutral atom quantum processor. We present two CNN architectures for analyzing neutral atom qubit readout data: a compact 5-layer single-qubit CNN architecture and a 6-layer multi-qubit CNN architecture. We benchmark both architectures against a conventional Gaussian threshold analysis method. In a sparse array (9 {\mu}m atom separation) which experiences negligible crosstalk, we observed up to 32% and 56% error reduction for the multi-qubit and single-qubit architectures respectively, as compared to the benchmark. In a tightly spaced array (5 {\mu}m atom separation), which suffers from readout crosstalk, we observed up to 43% and 32% error reduction in the multi-qubit and single-qubit CNN architectures respectively, as compared to the benchmark. By examining the correlation between the predicted states of neighboring qubits, we found that the multi-qubit CNN architecture reduces the crosstalk correlation up to 78.5%. This work demonstrates a proof of concept for a CNN network to be implemented as a real-time readout processing method on a neutral atom quantum computer, enabling faster readout time and improved fidelity.</description>

      <title>Atomique: A Quantum Compiler for Reconfigurable Neutral Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutral atom array has gained prominence in quantum computing for its scalability and operation fidelity. Previous works focus on fixed atom arrays (FAAs) that require extensive SWAP operations for long-range interactions. This work explores a novel architecture reconfigurable atom arrays (RAAs), also known as field programmable qubit arrays (FPQAs), which allows for coherent atom movements during circuit execution under some constraints. Such atom movements, which are unique to this architecture, could reduce the cost of long-range interactions significantly if the atom movements could be scheduled strategically.
  In this work, we introduce Atomique, a compilation framework designed for qubit mapping, atom movement, and gate scheduling for RAA. Atomique contains a qubit-array mapper to decide the coarse-grained mapping of the qubits to arrays, leveraging MAX k-Cut on a constructed gate frequency graph to minimize SWAP overhead. Subsequently, a qubit-atom mapper determines the fine-grained mapping of qubits to specific atoms in the array and considers load balance to prevent hardware constraint violations. We further propose a router that identifies parallel gates, schedules them simultaneously, and reduces depth. We evaluate Atomique across 20+ diverse benchmarks, including generic circuits (arbitrary, QASMBench, SupermarQ), quantum simulation, and QAOA circuits. Atomique consistently outperforms IBM Superconducting, FAA with long-range gates, and FAA with rectangular and triangular topologies, achieving significant reductions in depth and the number of two-qubit gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17991v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the SYK model -- an important toy model for quantum gravity on IBM's superconducting qubit quantum computers. By using a graph-coloring algorithm to minimize the number of commuting clusters of terms in the qubitized Hamiltonian, we find the gate complexity of the time evolution using the first-order product formula for $N$ Majorana fermions is $\mathcal{O}(N^5 J^{2}t^2/\epsilon)$ where $J$ is the dimensionful coupling parameter, $t$ is the evolution time, and $\epsilon$ is the desired precision. With this improved resource requirement, we perform the time evolution for $N=6, 8$ with maximum two-qubit circuit depth of 343. We perform different error mitigation schemes on the noisy hardware results and find good agreement with the exact diagonalization results on classical computers and noiseless simulators. In particular, we compute return probability after time $t$ and out-of-time order correlators (OTOC) which is a standard observable of quantifying the chaotic nature of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Learning finitely correlated states: stability of the spectral reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that marginals of blocks of $t$ systems of any finitely correlated translation invariant state on a chain can be learned, in trace distance, with $O(t^2)$ copies -- with an explicit dependence on local dimension, memory dimension and spectral properties of a certain map constructed from the state -- and computational complexity polynomial in $t$. The algorithm requires only the estimation of a marginal of a controlled size, in the worst case bounded by the minimum bond dimension, from which it reconstructs a translation invariant matrix product operator. In the analysis, a central role is played by the theory of operator systems. A refined error bound can be proven for $C^*$-finitely correlated states, which have an operational interpretation in terms of sequential quantum channels applied to the memory system. We can also obtain an analogous error bound for a class of matrix product density operators reconstructible by local marginals. In this case, a linear number of marginals must be estimated, obtaining a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(t^3)$. The learning algorithm also works for states that are only close to a finitely correlated state, with the potential of providing competitive algorithms for other interesting families of states.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Probabilistic Readout Correction of Mid-Circuit Measurements for Adaptive Feedback via Measurement Randomized Compiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum measurements are a fundamental component of quantum computing. However, on modern-day quantum computers, measurements can be more error prone than quantum gates, and are susceptible to non-unital errors as well as non-local correlations due to measurement crosstalk. While readout errors can be mitigated in post-processing, it is inefficient in the number of qubits due to a combinatorially-large number of possible states that need to be characterized. In this work, we show that measurement errors can be tailored into a simple stochastic error model using randomized compiling, enabling the efficient mitigation of readout errors via quasi-probability distributions reconstructed from the measurement of a single preparation state in an exponentially large confusion matrix. We demonstrate the scalability and power of this approach by correcting readout errors without matrix inversion on a large number of different preparation states applied to a register of eight superconducting transmon qubits. Moreover, we show that this method can be extended to mid-circuit measurements used for active feedback via quasi-probabilistic error cancellation, and demonstrate the correction of measurement errors on an ancilla qubit used to detect and actively correct bit-flip errors on an entangled memory qubit. Our approach enables the correction of readout errors on large numbers of qubits, and offers a strategy for correcting readout errors in adaptive circuits in which the results of mid-circuit measurements are used to perform conditional operations on non-local qubits in real time.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes a protocol for Fermionic Hamiltonian learning. For the Hubbard model defined on a bounded-degree graph, the Heisenberg-limited scaling is achieved while allowing for state preparation and measurement errors. To achieve $\epsilon$-accurate estimation for all parameters, only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$ total evolution time is needed, and the constant factor is independent of the system size. Moreover, our method only involves simple one or two-site Fermionic manipulations, which is desirable for experiment implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emitters in high refractive index materials like 4H-SiC suffer from reduced detection of photons because of losses caused by total internal reflection. Thus, integration into efficient nanophotonic structures which couple the emission of photons to a well defined waveguide mode can significantly enhance the photon detection efficiency. In addition, interfacing this waveguide to a classical fiber network is of similar importance to detect the photons and perform experiments. Here, we show a waveguide fiber interface in SiC. By careful measurements we determine efficiencies exceeding 93 % for the transfer of photons from SiC nanobeams to fibers. We use this interface to create a bright single photon source based on waveguide integrated V2 defects in 4H-SiC and achieve an overall photon count rate of 181 kilo-counts per second. We observe and quantify the strain induced shift of the ground state spin states and demonstrate coherent control of the electron spin with a coherence time of T2=42.5 $\rm\mu$s.</description>

Abstract: This work considers the non-interactive source simulation problem (NISS). In the standard NISS scenario, a pair of distributed agents, Alice and Bob, observe a distributed binary memoryless source $(X^d,Y^d)$ generated based on joint distribution $P_{X,Y}$. The agents wish to produce a pair of discrete random variables $(U_d,V_d)$ with joint distribution $P_{U_d,V_d}$, such that $P_{U_d,V_d}$ converges in total variation distance to a target distribution $Q_{U,V}$. Two variations of the standard NISS scenario are considered. In the first variation, in addition to $(X^d,Y^d)$ the agents have access to a shared Bell state. The agents each measure their respective state, using a measurement of their choice, and use its classical output along with $(X^d,Y^d)$ to simulate the target distribution. This scenario is called the entanglement-assisted NISS (EA-NISS). In the second variation, the agents have access to a classical common random bit $Z$, in addition to $(X^d,Y^d)$. This scenario is called the classical common randomness NISS (CR-NISS). It is shown that for binary-output NISS scenarios, the set of feasible distributions for EA-NISS and CR-NISS are equal with each other. Hence, there is not quantum advantage in these EA-NISS scenarios. For non-binary output NISS scenarios, it is shown through an example that there are distributions that are feasible in EA-NISS but not in CR-NISS. This shows that there is a quantum advantage in non-binary output EA-NISS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonincreasing feature of temporal quantum steering under a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map, as proposed by Chen, et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 020503 (2016), has been considered as a practical measure of non-Markovianity. In this paper, we utilize an all-optical scheme to simulate a non-Markovian collision model and to examine how Gaussian steering can be used as a tool for quantifying the non-Markovianity of a structured continuous variable (CV) Gaussian channel. By modifying the reflectivity of the beam splitters (BSs), we are able to tune the degree of non-Markovianity of the channel. After analyzing the non-Markovian degree of the dissipative channel within two steering scenarios, we discovered that the Gaussian steering-based non-Markovian measure depends the specific scenario because of the asymmetry of Gaussian steering. We also compared the Gaussian steering based non-Markovianity to the one based on the violation of the divisibility of CPTP map.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear quantum photonics serves as a cornerstone in photonic quantum technologies, such as universal quantum computing and quantum communications. The emergence of integrated photonics platform not only offers the advantage of large-scale manufacturing but also provides a variety of engineering methods. Given the complexity of integrated photonics engineering, a comprehensive simulation framework is essential to fully harness the potential of the platform. In this context, we introduce a nonlinear quantum photonics simulation framework which can accurately model a variety of features such as adiabatic waveguide, material anisotropy, linear optics components, photon losses, and detectors. Furthermore, utilizing the framework, we have developed a device scheme, chip-scale temporal walk-off compensation, that is useful for various quantum information processing tasks. Applying the simulation framework, we show that the proposed device scheme can enhance the squeezing parameter of photon-pair sources and the conversion efficiency of quantum frequency converters without relying on higher pump power.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and single-photon nonlinearity in free-electron quantum optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation that free electrons can interact coherently with quantized electromagnetic fields and matter systems has led to a plethora of proposals leveraging the unique quantum properties of free electrons. At the heart of these proposals lies the assumption of a strong quantum interaction between a flying free electron and a photonic mode. However, existing schemes are intrinsically limited by electron diffraction, which puts an upper bound on the interaction length and therefore the quantum coupling strength. Here, we propose the use of "free-electron fibers'': effectively one-dimensional photonic systems where free electrons co-propagate with two guided modes. The first mode applies a ponderomotive trap to the free electron, effectively lifting the limitations due to electron diffraction. The second mode strongly couples to the guided free electron, with an enhanced coupling that is orders of magnitude larger than previous designs. Moreover, the extended interaction lengths enabled by our scheme allows for strong single-photon nonlinearities mediated by free electrons. We predict a few interesting observable quantum effects in our system, such as deterministic single-photon emission and complex, nonlinear multimode dynamics. Our proposal paves the way towards the realization of many anticipated effects in free-electron quantum optics, such as non-Gaussian light generation, deterministic single photon emission, and quantum gates controlled by free-electron--photon interactions.</description>

Abstract: We establish the concept of topological pumping in one-dimensional systems with long-range interactions and apply it to the transport of a photon in quantum optical systems. In our theoretical investigation, we introduce an extended version of the Rice-Mele model with all-to-all exchange interactions. By analyzing its properties, we identify the general conditions for topological pumping and demonstrate the topologically protected and dispersionless transport of a photon on a one-dimensional emitter chain. As concrete examples, we investigate three different popular quantum optics platforms, namely Rydberg atom lattices, dense lattices of atoms excited to low-lying electronic states, and atoms coupled to waveguides, using experimentally relevant parameters. We observe that despite the long-ranged character of the dipole-dipole interactions, topological pumping facilitates the transport of a photon with a fidelity per cycle which can reach 99.9%. Moreover, we find that the photon pumping process remains topologically protected against local disorder in the coupling rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two quantitative measures of the strength of causal relations in general physical theories. These two measures called the maximum and minimum causal effect, capture the maximum and minimum changes in a physical system induced by changes in another system. In quantum theory, we show that both measures possess important properties, such as continuity and faithfulness, and can be evaluated through optimization over orthogonal pairs of input states. For the maximum causal effect, we provide numerical lower bounds based on a variational algorithm, which can be used to estimate the strength of causal relations without performing a full quantum process tomography. To illustrate our algorithm, we analyze two paradigmatic examples, the first involving a coherent quantum superposition of direct cause and common cause, and the second involving communication through a coherent quantum superposition of two completely depolarizing channels.</description>

      <title>Qubit frugal entanglement determination with the deep multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deep multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (DMERA) on quantum hardware and the causal cone of a subset of the qubits which make up the ansatz. This causal cone spans $O(M+\log{N})$ physical qubits on a quantum device, where $M$ and $N$ are the subset size and the total number qubits in the ansatz respectively. This allows for the determination of the von Neumann entanglement entropy of the $N$ qubit wave-function using $O(M+\log{N})$ qubits by diagonalization of the reduced density matrix (RDM). We show this by randomly initializing a 16-qubit DMERA and diagonalizing the resulting RDM of the $M$-qubit subsystem using density matrix simulation. As an example of practical interest, we also encode the variational ground state of the quantum critical long-range transverse field Ising model (LRTIM) on 8 spins using DMERA. We perform density matrix simulation with and without noise to obtain entanglement entropies in separate experiments using only 4 qubits. Finally we repeat the experiment on the IBM Kyoto backend reproducing simulation results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing initial state overlap through orbital optimization for faster molecular electronic ground-state energy estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum phase estimation algorithm stands as the primary method for determining the ground state energy of a molecular electronic Hamiltonian on a quantum computer. In this context, the ability to initialize a classically tractable state that has a strong overlap with the desired ground state is critical as it directly affects the runtime of the algorithm. However, several numerical studies have shown that this overlap decays exponentially with system size. In this work, we demonstrate that this decay can be alleviated by optimizing the molecular orbital basis, for an initial state constructed from a single Slater determinant. We propose a practical method to achieve this optimization without knowledge of the true molecular ground state and test this method numerically. By comparing the resulting optimized orbitals to the natural orbitals, we find improved overlap. Specifically, for four iron-sulfur molecules, which are known to suffer from the mentioned decay, we show that our method yields one to two orders of magnitude improvement compared to localized molecular orbitals.</description>

Abstract: Diagonalization of matrix pencils provide a uniform technique to transcribe operator-valued violations of Boole's `conditions of possible experience' involving multipartite correlations into contextuality. They also provide structural analysis of the contexts involved, and thereby suggest compact forms of deviations of quantized systems from classical predictions.</description>

      <title>High-Coherence Kerr-cat qubit in 2D architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr-cat qubit is a bosonic qubit in which multi-photon Schrodinger cat states are stabilized by applying a two-photon drive to an oscillator with a Kerr nonlinearity. The suppressed bit-flip rate with increasing cat size makes this qubit a promising candidate to implement quantum error correction codes tailored for noise-biased qubits. However, achieving strong light-matter interactions necessary for stabilizing and controlling this qubit has traditionally required strong microwave drives that heat the qubit and degrade its performance. In contrast, increasing the coupling to the drive port removes the need for strong drives at the expense of large Purcell decay. By integrating an effective band-block filter on-chip, we overcome this trade-off and realize a Kerr-cat qubit in a scalable 2D superconducting circuit with high coherence. This filter provides 30 dB of isolation at the qubit frequency with negligible attenuation at the frequencies required for stabilization and readout. We experimentally demonstrate quantum non-demolition readout fidelity of 99.6% for a cat with 8 photons. Also, to have high-fidelity universal control over this qubit, we combine fast Rabi oscillations with a new demonstration of the X(90) gate through phase modulation of the stabilization drive. Finally, the lifetime in this architecture is examined as a function of the cat size of up to 10 photons in the oscillator achieving a bit-flip time higher than 1 ms and only a linear decrease in the phase-flip time, in good agreement with the theoretical analysis of the circuit. Our qubit shows promise as a building block for fault-tolerant quantum processors with a small footprint.</description>

      <title>Generalized Two-Particle Interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon interference is an interesting quantum phenomenon that is usually captured in two distinct types of experiments, namely the Hanbury-Brown- Twiss (HBT) experiment and the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment. While the HBT experiment was carried out much earlier in 1956, with classical light, the demonstration of the HOM effect came much later in 1987. Unlike the former, the latter has been argued to be a purely quantum effect. A generalized formulation of two-particle interference is presented here. The HOM and the HBT effects emerge as special cases in the general analysis. A realizable two-particle interference experiment, which is intermediate between the two effects, is proposed and analyzed. Thus two-particle interference is shown to be a single phenomenon with various possible implementations, including the HBT and HOM setups.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of structure-preserving deterministic numerical schemes for Lindblad equations. This family of schemes has a simple form and can systemically achieve arbitrary high-order accuracy in theory. Moreover, these schemes can also overcome the non-physical issues that arise from many traditional numerical schemes. Due to their preservation of physical nature, these schemes can be straightforwardly used as backbones for further developing randomized and quantum algorithms in simulating Lindblad equations. In this work, we systematically study these methods and perform a detailed error analysis, which is validated through numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: We consider two non-relativistic quantum clocks interacting with a Newtonian gravitational field produced by a spherical mass. In the framework of Page and Wootters approach, we derive a time dilation for the time states of the clocks. The delay is in agreement up to first order with the gravitational time dilation obtained from the Schwarzschild metric. This result can be extended by considering the relativistic gravitational potential: in this case we obtain the agreement with the exact Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frictionless, directional propagation of particles at the boundary of topological materials is one of the most striking phenomena in transport. These chiral edge modes lie at the heart of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, and their extraordinary robustness against noise and disorder reflects the quantization of Hall conductivity in these systems. Despite their central importance, controllable injection of edge modes, and direct imaging of their propagation, structure, and dynamics, is challenging. Here, we demonstrate the distillation of individual chiral edge states in a rapidly-rotating bosonic superfluid confined by an optical boundary. Tuning the wall sharpness, we reveal the smooth crossover between soft wall behaviour in which the propagation speed is proportional to wall steepness, and the hard wall regime exhibiting chiral free particles. From the skipping motion of atoms along the boundary, we spectroscopically infer the energy gap between the ground and first excited edge bands, and reveal its evolution from the bulk Landau level splitting for a soft boundary, to the hard wall limit.</description>

      <title>Multi-module microwave assembly for fast read-out and charge noise characterization of silicon quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast measurements of quantum devices is important in areas such as quantum sensing, quantum computing and nanodevice quality analysis. Here, we develop a superconductor-semiconductor multi-module microwave assembly to demonstrate charge state readout at the state-of-the-art. The assembly consist of a superconducting readout resonator interfaced to a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chiplet containing quantum dots (QDs) in a high-$\kappa$ nanowire transistor. The superconducting chiplet contains resonant and coupling elements as well as $LC$ filters that, when interfaced with the silicon chip, result in a resonant frequency $f=2.12$ GHz, a loaded quality factor $Q=850$, and a resonator impedance $Z=470$ $\Omega$. Combined with the large gate lever arms of SOI technology, we achieve a minimum integration time for single and double QD transitions of 2.77 ns and 13.5 ns, respectively. We utilize the assembly to measure charge noise over 9 decades of frequency up to 500 kHz and find a 1/$f$ dependence across the whole frequency spectrum as well as a charge noise level of 4 $\mu$eV/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz. The modular microwave circuitry presented here can be directly utilized in conjunction with other quantum device to improve the readout performance as well as enable large bandwidth noise spectroscopy, all without the complexity of superconductor-semiconductor monolithic fabrication.</description>

Abstract: We propose a setting that simulates Hawking radiation from an analogue bouncing geometry, i.e., a collapsing geometry that reverts its collapse after a finite time, in a setup consisting of a coplanar waveguide terminated in superconducting quantum-interference devices at both ends. We demonstrate experimental feasibility of the proposed setup within the current technology. Our analysis illustrates the resilience of Hawking radiation under changes in the physics at energy scales much larger than the temperature, supporting the idea that regular alternatives to black holes would also emit Hawking radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional system of non-interacting fermions featuring both boundary driving and continuous monitoring of the bulk particle density. Due to the measurements, the expectation values of the local density and current operators are random variables whose average behavior is described by a well studied Lindblad master equation. By means of exact numerical computations, we go beyond the averaged dynamics and study their full probability distribution functions, focusing on the late-time stationary regime. We find that, contrary to the averaged values, the spatial profiles of the median density and current are non-trivial, exhibiting qualitative differences as a function of the monitoring strength. At weak monitoring, the medians are close to the means, displaying diffusive spatial profiles. At strong monitoring, we find that the median density and current develop a domain-wall and single-peak profile, respectively, which are suggestive of a Zeno-like localization in typical quantum trajectories. While we are not able to identify a sharp phase transition as a function of the monitoring rate, our work highlights the usefulness of characterizing typical behavior beyond the averaged values in the context of monitored many-body quantum dynamics.</description>

We also provide three-dimensional interpretations of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gaugings through abelian Chern-Simons theories, which act as symmetry topological field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems with conserved dipole moment have drawn considerable interest in light of their realization in recent experiments on tilted optical lattices. An important question for such systems is delineating the conditions under which they admit a unique gapped ground state that is consistent with all symmetries. Here, we study one-dimensional translation-invariant lattices that conserve U(1) charge and $\mathbb{Z}_L$ dipole moment, where discreteness of the dipole symmetry is enforced by periodic boundary conditions, with $L$ the system size. We show that in these systems, a symmetric, gapped, and non-degenerate ground state requires not only integer charge filling, but also a fixed value of the dipole filling, while other fractional dipole fillings enforce either a gapless or symmetry-breaking ground state. In contrast with prior results in the literature, we find that the dipole filling constraint depends both on the charge filling as well as the system size, emphasizing the subtle interplay of dipole symmetry with boundary conditions. We support our results with numerical simulations and exact results.</description>

Abstract: We investigate classes of interacting quantum spin systems in a single-mode cavity with a Dicke coupling, as a paradigmatic example of strongly correlated light-matter systems. Coming from the limit of weak light-matter couplings and large number of matter entities, we map the relevant low-energy sector of a broad class of models in the non-superradiant phases onto the exactly solvable Dicke model. We apply the outcomes to the Dicke-Ising model as a paradigmatic example, in agreement with results obtained by mean-field theory. We further accompany and verify our findings with finite-size calculations, using exact diagonalization and the series expansion method pcst++.</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. We also show that thermal and electric Hall conductivity of Abelian topological order can be extracted by partial rotations. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

Abstract: We developed a general framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing of molecular and periodic embedding approaches based on an orbital space separation of the fragment and environment degrees of freedom. We demonstrate its potential by presenting a specific implementation of periodic range-separated DFT coupled to a quantum circuit ansatz, whereby the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum equation-of-motion algorithm are used to obtain the low-lying spectrum of the embedded fragment Hamiltonian. Application of this scheme to study localized electronic states in materials is showcased through the accurate prediction of the optical properties of the neutral oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide (MgO). Despite some discrepancies in the position of the main absorption band, the method demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ab initio approaches, particularly evidenced by the excellent agreement with the experimental photoluminescence emission peak.</description>
