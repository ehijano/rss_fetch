      <title>Higher-Order Neuromorphic Ising Machines -- Autoencoders and Fowler-Nordheim Annealers are all you need for Scalability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a higher-order neuromorphic Ising machine that exhibits superior scalability compared to architectures based on quadratization, while also achieving state-of-the-art quality and reliability in solutions with competitive time-to-solution metrics. At the core of the proposed machine is an asynchronous autoencoder architecture that captures higher-order interactions by directly manipulating Ising clauses instead of Ising spins, thereby maintaining resource complexity independent of interaction order. Asymptotic convergence to the Ising ground state is ensured by sampling the autoencoder latent space defined by the spins, based on the annealing dynamics of the Fowler-Nordheim quantum mechanical tunneling. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed higher-order neuromorphic Ising machine, we systematically solved benchmark combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT and MAX-SAT, comparing the results to those obtained using a second-order Ising machine employing the same annealing process. Our findings indicate that the proposed architecture consistently provides higher quality solutions in shorter time frames compared to the second-order model across multiple runs. Additionally, we show that the techniques based on the sparsity of the interconnection matrix, such as graph coloring, can be effectively applied to higher-order neuromorphic Ising machines, enhancing the solution quality and the time-to-solution. The time-to-solution can be further improved through hardware co-design, as demonstrated in this paper using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The results presented in this paper provide further evidence that autoencoders and Fowler-Nordheim annealers are sufficient to achieve reliability and scaling of any-order neuromorphic Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-Assisted Evolution for Efficient Multi-branch Connection Design in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often incorporate multi-branch connections, enabling multi-scale feature extraction and enhancing the capture of diverse features. This design improves network capacity and generalisation to unseen data. However, training such DNNs can be computationally expensive. The challenge is further exacerbated by the complexity of identifying optimal network architectures. To address this, we leverage Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to automatically discover high-performing architectures, a process commonly known as neuroevolution. We introduce a novel approach based on Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) to encode multi-branch (MB) connections within DNNs, referred to as NeuroLGP-MB. To efficiently design the DNNs, we use surrogate-assisted EAs. While their application in simple artificial neural networks has been influential, we scale their use from dozens or hundreds of sample points to thousands, aligning with the demands of complex DNNs by incorporating a semantic-based approach in our surrogate-assisted EA. Furthermore, we introduce a more advanced surrogate model that outperforms baseline, computationally expensive, and simpler surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Wireless Split Computing with Resonate-and-Fire Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and total energy consumption during inference and communication.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this through a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations, along with a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.</description>

      <title>AgentBreeder: Mitigating the AI Safety Impact of Multi-Agent Scaffolds via Self-Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaffolding Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-agent systems often improves performance on complex tasks, but the safety impact of such scaffolds has not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds. We evaluate discovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In 'blue' mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores. In 'red' mode, we find adversarially weak scaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work demonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/J-Rosser-UK/AgentBreeder.</description>

      <title>Effective Stimulus Propagation in Neural Circuits: Driver Node Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization. Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 64-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.</description>
