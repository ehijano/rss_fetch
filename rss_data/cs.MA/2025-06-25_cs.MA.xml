      <title>MATE: LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Translation Environment for Accessibility Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs. Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description. MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/Multi-Agent-MATE.</description>

      <title>Collaborative governance of cyber violence: A two-phase, multi-scenario four-party evolutionary game and SBI1I2R public opinion dissemination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber violence severely disrupts public order in both cyberspace and the real world. Existing studies have gradually advocated collaborative governance but rely on macro-level theoretical analyses. This study integrates micro- and macro-level perspectives to propose a two-stage, multi-scenario governance mechanism for cyber violence. In the first phase, a multi-scenario evolutionary game model with four parties involved in cyber violence was developed based on evolutionary game theory. Matlab simulations show that under strong government regulation, moderate levels of punishment implemented by the government against the online media that adopt misguidance strategies can achieve the most desirable stable state. In the second phase, the role of bystanders was introduced by integrating communication dynamics theory, and emotional factors were considered alongside game strategies. This led to the development of a new SBI1I2R model for public opinion dissemination in cyber violence. Netlogo simulations found that increasing the "correct guidance" strategy by the online media reduces the influence of cyber violence supporters and the time it takes for their nodes to drop to zero, but does not significantly shorten the time for the peak to occur. Comparatively, collaborative intervention between the online media and the government was most effective in curbing public opinion, followed by the government's independent "strong regulation." Relying solely on the online media's "correct guidance" produced the weakest effect. Finally, this mechanism was applied to a case study, and a multi-stage, multi-scenario analysis based on life cycle theory enhanced its practical applicability.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes, learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture - Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Mechanism in Sequential Auctions under Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient, truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost Infrastructure-Free 3D Relative Localization with Sub-Meter Accuracy in Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative localization in the near-field scenario is critically important for unmanned vehicle (UxV) applications. Although related works addressing 2D relative localization problem have been widely studied for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), the problem in 3D scenarios for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) involves more uncertainties and remains to be investigated. Inspired by the phenomenon that animals can achieve swarm behaviors solely based on individual perception of relative information, this study proposes an infrastructure-free 3D relative localization framework that relies exclusively on onboard ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors. Leveraging 2D relative positioning research, we conducted feasibility analysis, system modeling, simulations, performance evaluation, and field tests using UWB sensors. The key contributions of this work include: derivation of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) for near-field scenarios; development of two localization algorithms -- one based on Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) and another employing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE); comprehensive performance comparison and computational complexity analysis against state-of-the-art methods; simulation studies and field experiments; a novel sensor deployment strategy inspired by animal behavior, enabling single-sensor implementation within the proposed framework for UxV applications. The theoretical, simulation, and experimental results demonstrate strong generalizability to other 3D near-field localization tasks, with significant potential for a cost-effective cross-platform UxV collaborative system.</description>

      <title>Computing Tree Structures in Anonymous Graphs via Mobile Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) tree constructions are classical problems in distributed computing, traditionally studied in the message-passing model, where static nodes communicate via messages. This paper investigates MST and BFS tree construction in an agent-based network, where mobile agents explore a graph and compute. Each node hosts one agent, and communication occurs when agents meet at a node. We consider $n$ agents initially dispersed (one per node) in an anonymous, arbitrary $n$-node, $m$-edge graph $G$. The goal is to construct the BFS and MST trees from this configuration such that each tree edge is known to at least one of its endpoints, while minimizing time and memory per agent. We work in a synchronous model and assume agents have no prior knowledge of any graph parameters such as $n$, $m$, $D$, $\Delta$ (graph diameter and maximum degree). Prior work solves BFS in $O(D\Delta)$ rounds with $O(\log n)$ bits per agent, assuming the root is known. We give a deterministic algorithm that constructs the BFS tree in $O(\min(D\Delta, m\log n) + n\log n + \Delta \log^2 n)$ rounds using $O(\log n)$ bits per agent without root knowledge. To determine the root, we solve leader election and MST construction. We elect a leader and construct the MST in $O(n\log n + \Delta \log^2 n)$ rounds, with $O(\log n)$ bits per agent. Prior MST algorithms require $O(m + n\log n)$ rounds and $\max(\Delta, \log n) \log n$ bits. Our results significantly improve memory efficiency and time, achieving nearly linear-time leader election and MST. Agents are assumed to know $\lambda$, the maximum identifier, bounded by a polynomial in $n$.</description>

      <title>Center of Gravity-Guided Focusing Influence Mechanism for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory. FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3) encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative performance compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Social Simulations Require a Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social simulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to social science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona'' that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems: alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency (maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness (reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2) agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.</description>

      <title>KnowRL: Exploring Knowledgeable Reinforcement Learning for Factuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Triangle Counting: Unlocking Truss Decomposition, Triangle Centrality, and Local Clustering Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triangle counting in a graph is a fundamental problem with wide-ranging applications. It is crucial for understanding graph structure and serves as a basis for more advanced graph analytics. One key application is truss decomposition, a technique for identifying maximal, highly interconnected subgraphs, revealing structural cohesion and tight-knit communities in complex graphs. This facilitates analysis of relationships and information flow in fields such as social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Using mobile agents or robots for tasks like truss decomposition and clustering coefficient computation is especially advantageous in decentralised environments with limited or unreliable communication. In such scenarios, agents can perform local computations without requiring an extensive communication infrastructure. This is valuable in contexts like disaster response, urban management, and military operations, where broadcast communication is impractical.
  In this paper, we address the triangle counting problem in an arbitrary anonymous graph using mobile agents. This method is extended as a subroutine to solve the truss decomposition problem and compute triangle centrality and the local clustering coefficient for each node. Our approach uses $n$ autonomous mobile agents, each starting at a different node of an $n$-node graph. These agents coordinate to collaboratively solve triangle enumeration, then truss decomposition, triangle centrality, and clustering coefficient. We assume a synchronous system where agents execute tasks concurrently, allowing time to be measured in rounds. The graph is anonymous (nodes have no IDs), but agents have distinct IDs and limited memory. Agents can perform local computations and communicate only when co-located. Our goal is to design algorithms that minimise both time and memory per agent, while enabling solutions to the above problems.</description>

      <title>Smart Traffic Signals: Comparing MARL and Fixed-Time Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.</description>

Abstract: We develop information theory for the temporal behavior of memoryful agents moving through complex -- structured, stochastic -- environments. We introduce information processes -- stochastic processes produced by cognitive agents in real-time as they interact with and interpret incoming stimuli. We provide basic results on the ergodicity and semantics of the resulting time series of Shannon information measures that monitor an agent's adapting view of uncertainty and structural correlation in its environment.</description>

Abstract: As the complexity of integrated circuit designs continues to escalate, the functional verification becomes increasingly challenging. Reference models, critical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming more intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by large language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating complex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model generation and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from design specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating design standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a building-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design capabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts verification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying complexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and quality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance improvement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable enhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its capacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the iterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of 5.90x compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the potential of ChatModel to significantly advance the automation of reference model generation and validation.</description>

      <title>Experimental Setup and Software Pipeline to Evaluate Optimization based Autonomous Multi-Robot Search Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Signal source localization has been a problem of interest in the multi-robot systems domain given its applications in search &amp; rescue and hazard localization in various industrial and outdoor settings. A variety of multi-robot search algorithms exist that usually formulate and solve the associated autonomous motion planning problem as a heuristic model-free or belief model-based optimization process. Most of these algorithms however remains tested only in simulation, thereby losing the opportunity to generate knowledge about how such algorithms would compare/contrast in a real physical setting in terms of search performance and real-time computing performance. To address this gap, this paper presents a new lab-scale physical setup and associated open-source software pipeline to evaluate and benchmark multi-robot search algorithms. The presented physical setup innovatively uses an acoustic source (that is safe and inexpensive) and small ground robots (e-pucks) operating in a standard motion-capture environment. This setup can be easily recreated and used by most robotics researchers. The acoustic source also presents interesting uncertainty in terms of its noise-to-signal ratio, which is useful to assess sim-to-real gaps. The overall software pipeline is designed to readily interface with any multi-robot search algorithm with minimal effort and is executable in parallel asynchronous form. This pipeline includes a framework for distributed implementation of multi-robot or swarm search algorithms, integrated with a ROS (Robotics Operating System)-based software stack for motion capture supported localization. The utility of this novel setup is demonstrated by using it to evaluate two state-of-the-art multi-robot search algorithms, based on swarm optimization and batch-Bayesian Optimization (called Bayes-Swarm), as well as a random walk baseline.</description>

      <title>PBFT-Backed Semantic Voting for Multi-Agent Memory Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17338</link>

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex, dynamic environments necessitates robust and efficient mechanisms for managing shared knowledge. A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain synchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or inconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework designed to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in MAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88% voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a 92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an 82% cache hit rate for memory access.</description>
