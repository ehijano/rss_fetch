      <title>Enhanced superconductivity of hydrogenated $\beta_{12}$ borophene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Borophene stands out among elemental two-dimensional materials due to its extraordinary physical properties, including structural polymorphism, strong anisotropy, metallicity, and the potential for phonon-mediated superconductivity. However, confirming superconductivity in borophene experimentally has been evasive to date, mainly due to the detrimental effects of metallic substrates and its susceptibility to oxidation. In this study, we present an \textit{ab initio} analysis of superconductivity in the experimentally synthesized hydrogenated $\beta_{12}$ borophene, which has been proven to be less prone to oxidation. Our findings demonstrate that hydrogenation significantly enhances both the stability and superconducting properties of $\beta_{12}$ borophene. Furthermore, we reveal that tensile strain and hole doping, achievable through various experimental methods, significantly enhance the critical temperature, reaching up to 29 K. These findings not only promote further fundamental research on superconducting borophene and its heterostructures, but also position hydrogenated borophene as a versatile platform for low-dimensional superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of pressure-induced high temperature superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We successfully synthesized samples of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7+\delta}$ ($\delta = -0.50$, $-0.16$, $0.00$, $+0.01$, and $+0.12$) and measured the resistance under extremely high pressures using a diamond anvil cell to establish the electronic phase diagram. A Mott insulating state appears at $\delta = -0.50$, where all Ni ions are divalent. With increasing oxygen content, superconductivity appears at $\delta = 0.00$ and higher, above approximately 25 GPa, passing through Anderson localization at $\delta = -0.16$. The superconducting transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ decreases with increasing pressures for both $\delta = 0.00$ and $+0.12$, with the pressure dependence of $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ being much stronger in the latter than in the former.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultrafast Magnetic Steps for Coherent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in ultrafast magnetism and in functional materials research in general, has been the generation of a universal, ultrafast stimulus able to switch between stable magnetic states. Solving it would open up many new opportunities for fundamental studies, with potential impact on future data storage technologies. Ideally, step-like magnetic field transients with infinitely fast rise time would serve this purpose. Here, we develop a new approach to generate ultrafast magnetic field steps, based on an ultrafast quench of supercurrents in a superconductor. Magnetic field steps with millitesla amplitude, picosecond risetimes and slew rates approaching 1 GT/s are achieved. We test the potential of this technique by coherently rotating the magnetization in a ferrimagnet. With suitable improvements in the geometry of the device, these magnetic steps can be made both larger and faster, leading to new applications that range from quenches across phase transitions to complete switching of magnetic order parameters.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Control of Quantum States in Radical Molecules on Superconducting Pb(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities on superconductors present a viable platform for building advanced applications in quantum technologies. However, a controlled manipulation of their quantum states continues to pose a significant challenge, hindering the progress in the field. Here we show the manipulation of magnetic states in the radical molecule 4,5,9,10-tetrabromo-1,3,6,8-tetraazapyrene (TBTAP) on a Pb(111) superconducting surface using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Tunneling spectra reveal Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states near the Fermi energy in isolated molecules. A quantum phase transition from singlet to doublet ground state is induced by changing the tip-molecule distance. Additionally, the presence of a second TBTAP molecule allows tuning of the YSR state position by altering the relative distance and can induce splitting of the YSR states for certain orientations. The construction of molecular chains up to pentamers shows periodic arrangements of charged and neutral molecules, with even-numbered chains forming a charged dimer structure at one end. Information can be encoded in these chains by switching the dimer position. These findings elucidate interactions between molecular assemblies and superconducting substrates, paving the way for advanced quantum-state engineering.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of first-order quantum superconductor-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental studies on strongly disordered indium oxide films have revealed an unusual first-order quantum phase transition between the superconducting and insulating states (SIT). This transition is characterized by a discontinuous jump from non-zero to zero values of superfluid stiffness at the critical point, contradicting the conventional "scaling scenario" typically associated with SIT. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for understanding this first-order transition. Our approach is based on the concept of competition between two fundamentally distinct ground states that arise from electron pairs initially localized by strong disorder: the superconducting state and the Coulomb glass insulator. These ground states are distinguished by two crucially different order parameters, suggesting a natural expectation of a discontinuous transition between them at $T=0$. This transition occurs when the magnitudes of the superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the Coulomb gap $E_C$ become comparable. Additionally, we extend our analysis to low non-zero temperatures and provide a mean-field "phase diagram" in the plane of $(T/\Delta,E_C/\Delta)$. Our results reveal the existence of a natural upper bound for the kinetic inductance of strongly disordered superconductors.</description>

      <title>Strong Pairing Originated from an Emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Berry Phase in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ offers a fresh platform for exploring unconventional pairing mechanisms. Starting with the basic argument that the electrons in $d_{z^2}$ orbitals nearly form local moments, we examine the effect of the Hubbard interaction $U$ on the binding strength of Cooper pairs based on a single-orbital bilayer model with intralayer hopping $t_{\|}$ and interlayer super-exchange $J_{\perp}$. By extensive density matrix renormalization group calculations, we observe a remarkable enhancement in binding energy as much as $10$-$20$ times larger with $U/t_\|$ increasing from $0$ to $12$ at $J_{\perp}/t_\|\sim 1$. We demonstrate that such a substantial enhancement stems from a kinetic-energy-driven mechanism. Specifically, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Berry phase will emerge at large $U$ due to the Hilbert space restriction (Mottness), which strongly suppresses the mobility of single particle propagation as compared to $U=0$. However, the kinetic energy of the electrons (holes) can be greatly restored by forming an interlayer spin-singlet pairing, which naturally results in a superconducting state even for relatively small $J_\perp$. An effective hard-core bosonic model is further proposed to estimate the superconducting transition temperature at the mean-field level.</description>
