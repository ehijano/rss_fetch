      <title>Multiscale Modeling of Gas Adsorption and Surface Coverage in Thermocatalytic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional methods for modeling thermocatalytic systems are typically based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), neglecting the inhomogeneous distributions of gas molecules in the reactive environment. However, industrial reactions often take place at high temperature and pressure, where the local densities of gas molecules near the catalyst surface can reach hundreds of times their bulk values. To assess the environmental impacts on surface composition and reaction kinetics, we integrate KS-DFT calculations for predicting surface bonding energy with classical DFT to evaluate gas distribution and the grand potential of the entire reactive system. This multiscale approach accounts for both bond formation and non-bonded interactions of gas molecules with the catalyst surface and reveals that the surface composition is determined not only by chemisorption but also by the accessibility of surface sites and their interactions with the surrounding molecules in the gas phase. This theoretical procedure was employed to establish the relationship between surface coverage, gas-phase composition, and bulk phase thermodynamic conditions with thermocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 as a benchmark. The computational framework opens new avenues for studying adsorption and coverage on catalytic surfaces under industrially relevant conditions.</description>

      <title>Solution-corrected Constant Potential Model for CO2 Electrocatalysis in Ionic Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selection of suitable ionic liquids (ILs) is critical for CO2 capture and electrocatalytic conversion into valuable chemical products. The screening process can be enhanced with theoretical simulations that reveal the property-performance relationship of ILs, accelerating the identification of optimal candidates. However, anhydrous ionic liquids exhibit low dielectric constants and high ion concentrations, challenging traditional first-principles calculations. Additionally, the spatial distribution of CO2 in the electric double layer (EDL) plays a crucial role in determining the electrocatalytic activity. This work proposes a solution-corrected constant potential model (CPM-sol) to account for the imbalance between the net charge and the number of electrons on the electrode surface through an implicit consideration of ion distributions. By incorporating solution-phase corrections into the conventional CPM model, we reveal the changes in the Fermi level and charge alongside the reaction process. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the impact of various IL properties on electrode surface charging and CO2 distribution. The theoretical results highlight the critical role of interactions between solution components, forming chain-like structures, in determining their distribution in confined environments and influencing the electrode surface charge. These findings provide insights for mechanism-guided electrolyte design.</description>

      <title>Ehrenfest Dynamics with Spontaneous Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Ehrenfest Dynamics with Spontaneous Localization (SLED), a decoherence-corrected extension of Ehrenfest dynamics based on the Gisin-Percival quantum-state diffusion (QSD) equation. In SLED, the electronic wavefunction evolves stochastically in the adiabatic energy basis, producing trajectory-level localization. The trajectory ensemble reproduces a Lindblad-type propagation of the reduced electronic density matrix. This approach ensures linearity, trace preservation, and complete positivity, providing a physically consistent alternative to ad hoc decoherence corrections commonly adopted in mixed quantum-classical methods. Benchmark simulations on one-dimensional Tully models and multidimensional spin-boson Hamiltonians demonstrate that SLED reproduces electronic populations and captures the essential features of coherence decay. The tests, however, also revealed that accurate treatment will require generalizing the localization kernel controlling the electron-nucleus coupling strength, from a constant into a function of time and phase space coordinates. SLED is implemented in the newly developed Skitten program and will be integrated into Newton-X. While the present work serves as a proof of concept, SLED establishes a rigorous and extensible framework that bridges mixed quantum-classical dynamics with open quantum system theory.</description>

      <title>Time delay as the origin of oscillations in anodic Si electrodissolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon is the most important semiconductor electrode with applications in photoelectrochemistry and sensor technology. Yet its electrochemistry exhibits many poorly understood phenomena, including oscillations during the anodic dissolution of silicon electrodes.
  In this article, we present a mathematical model based on physicochemical steps that captures these oscillations and enables a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanism. The model describes the formation and dissolution of an oxide layer, and determines the oxide composition and the electrostatic potential in the direction perpendicular to the electrode.
  Oscillations occur if the following conditions are fulfilled:
  1. The etching speed increases with defects in the oxide layer
  2. The number of defects decreases with increasing electric field strength at the Si-oxide interface.
  3. There is a sufficient time delay between the production and the etching of the oxide.
  Numerical simulations reproduce experimental results well, including the dependence of the oscillation amplitude and period on the potential, as well as the hysteresis behavior observed in cyclic voltammetry. Based on these results, we derive a simplified time-delay differential equation model. Using linear stability analysis, we confirm the essential role of the time delay for the oscillatory oxide-layer dynamics. The basic steps of the model are general and in line with the point defect model for growth and dissolution of passive films on metal electrodes. Therefore, it is likely applicable to a variety of oscillating anodic metal or semiconductor dissolution reactions.</description>

      <title>Toward the "platinum standard" of quantum chemistry on quantum computers: perturbative quadruple corrections in unitary coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a non-iterative, post hoc correction to the unitary coupled cluster theory with single, double, and triple excitations (UCCSDT) ansatz, which considers the leading-order effects of neglected quadruple excitations. We present two ways to derive this quadruples correction to UCCSDT, henceforth referred to as [Q-6], which leads to an improvement in the correlation energy shown to be correct through sixth-order in many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). A comparison between the UCC-based [Q-6] correction proposed in this work and analogous, "platinum" standard quadruples corrections proposed in conventional coupled cluster (CC) theory recognizes that [Q-6] is distinct from prior corrections since it is constructed entirely from internally connected components. Although Trotterized (t) and full operator variants of UCCSDT exhibit errors in scans of small molecule potential energy surfaces (PESs) that routinely exceed 1.6 mH, we find that t/UCCSDT[Q-6] is nevertheless able to achieve chemical accuracy as measured by the mean-unsigned error (MUE).</description>

      <title>Time-dependent density functional theory investigation of the formation of H$^{3+}$ from alkanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of H$^{3+}$ from ethane, propane, and butane dications was investigated with time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) simulations. This approach offers the benefit of simultaneously addressing nuclear and electronic dynamics, enabling the investigation of electronic excitation, charge transfer, ionization, and nuclear motion. For each dication we determined the ground-state HOMO, the branching ratios of all dissociation channels, and the mechanism leading to H$^{3+}$. The simulated branching ratios for ethane and propane are similar, while butane is markedly lower. Ethane follows the minimum-energy pathway (MEP) proposed previously; propane forms H$^{3+}$ mainly via H$_2$ roaming. In butane, H$^{3+}$ appears only through the MEP within the present trajectory set; roaming H$_2$ was not observed under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-head committees enable direct uncertainty prediction for atomistic foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials have become a standard tool for atomistic materials modelling. While models continue to become more generalisable, an open challenge relates to efficient uncertainty predictions for active learning and robust error analysis. In this work, we utilise MACE and its multi-head mechanism to implement a committee neural network potential for message-passing architectures, where the committee comprises multiple output modules attached to the same atomic environment descriptors. As with traditional committees of independent networks, the standard deviation of the predictions functions as an estimate of the model's uncertainty. We show for a range of datasets in custom-build models that the uncertainty of the force predictions correlates well with the true errors. We subsequently apply this concept to foundation models, specifically MACE-MP-0, where we train only the newly attached output heads while keeping the remaining part of the model fixed. We use this approach in an active learning workflow to condense the training set of the foundation model to just 5\% of its original size. The foundation model multi-head committee trained on the condensed training set enables reliable uncertainty estimation without any substantial decrease in prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Boron Clusters for Metal-Free Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-deficient boron clusters are identified as a fundamentally new class of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, entirely free of transition metals. Selective sodium extraction from NaAlB14 and Na2B29 via high-pressure diffusion control introduces hole doping into B12 icosahedral frameworks, resulting in OER activity exceeding that of Co3O4 by more than an order of magnitude, and exceptional durability under alkaline conditions. B12 clusters are known for their superchaotropic character, which destabilizes hydrogen bonding in water. In this system, H2O, instead of OH-, preferentially adsorbs on the catalyst surface, suggesting a distinct OER pathway mediated by molecular water. This adsorption behavior contrasts with conventional transition-metal oxides and reflects the unique interfacial properties of the boron clusters. Density functional theory reveals unoccupied p orbitals and unique local electric fields at the cluster surface, both of which could promote the water activation. These findings suggest a paradigm shift in OER catalysis, in which the unique interaction between B12 clusters and water drives the reaction, replacing the conventional role of redox-active metals. Hole-doped boron clusters thus offer a promising platform for designing high-performance and durable water-splitting catalysts, opening new avenues for OER design beyond conventional transition-metal chemistry.</description>

      <title>Towards chemical accuracy for chemi- and physisorption with an efficient density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding molecular adsorption on surfaces underpins many problems in chemistry and materials science. Accurately and efficiently describing the adsorption has been a challenging task for first-principles methods as the process can involve both short-range chemical bond formations and long-range physical interactions, e.g., the van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Density functional theory presents an appealing choice for modeling adsorption reactions, though calculations with many exchange correlation density functional approximations struggle to accurately describe both chemical and physical molecular adsorptions. Here, we propose an efficient density functional approximation that is accurate for both chemical and physical adsorption by concurrently optimizing its semilocal component and the long-range vdW correction against the prototypical adsorption CO/Pt(111) and Ar$_2$ binding energy curve. The resulting functional opens the door to accurate and efficient modeling of general molecular adsorption.</description>

      <title>Simulating and investigating various dynamic aspects of the $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A basic model of hydrogen bonds related to $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$, which is adapted from the Jaynes--Cummings model, is suggested, and its different dynamic features are studied theoretically. In this model, the making and breaking of hydrogen bonds happen alongside the creation and destruction of phonons in the surrounding medium. A number of simplifying assumptions about the dynamics of the molecules involved are used. The rotating wave approximation is applied under consideration of the strong-coupling condition. Dissipative dynamics under the Markovian approximation is obtained through solving the quantum master equation -- Lindbladian. We obtain the probabilities of reaction channels involving hydrogen bonds based on the parameters of the external environment. Differences between unitary and dissipative evolutions are discussed. Consideration is given to the effects of all kinds of potential interactions and dissipation on evolution. Consideration is also given to the reverse processes (inflows) of dissipation. The results show that the magnitude changes of the interactions and dissipation have a slight effect on the formation of hydrogen bonds, but the variation of the inflows significantly affects the formation of hydrogen bonds. According to the findings, the dynamics of the $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model can be controlled by selectively choosing system parameters. The results will be used as a basis to extend the research to more complex chemical and biological models in the future.</description>

      <title>Is the Full Power of Gaussian Boson Sampling Required for Simulating Vibronic Spectra Using Photonics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating vibronic spectra is a central task in physical chemistry, offering insight into important properties of molecules. Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that photonic platforms based on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) are capable of performing these simulations. However, whether an actual GBS approach is required depends on the molecule under investigation. To develop a better understanding on the requirements for simulating vibronic spectra, we explore connections between theoretical approximations in physical chemistry and their photonic counterparts. Mapping these approximations into photonics, we show that for certain molecules the GBS approach is unnecessary. We place special emphasis on the linear coupling approximation, which in photonics corresponds to sampling from multiple coherent states. By implementing this approach in experiments, we demonstrate improved similarities over previously reported GBS results for formic acid and identify the particular attributes that a molecule must exhibit for this, and other approximations, to be valid. These results highlight the importance in forming deeper connections between traditional methods and photonic approaches.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Mechanics to Organic Liquid Properties via a Universal Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools for unraveling atomistic insights into the structure and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, the universal and accurate prediction of macroscopic properties from ab initio calculations remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the trade-off between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Here, we present ByteFF-Pol, a graph neural network (GNN)-parameterized polarizable force field, trained exclusively on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data. Leveraging physically-motivated force field forms and training strategies, ByteFF-Pol exhibits exceptional performance in predicting thermodynamic and transport properties for a wide range of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical and machine learning force fields. The zero-shot prediction capability of ByteFF-Pol bridges the gap between microscopic QM calculations and macroscopic liquid properties, enabling the exploration of previously intractable chemical spaces. This advancement holds transformative potential for applications such as electrolyte design and custom-tailored solvent, representing a pivotal step toward data-driven materials discovery.</description>
