      <title>Biases in gendered citation practices: an exploratory study and some reflections on the Matthew and Matilda effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies conducted in different scientific disciplines have concluded that researchers belonging to some socio-cultural groups (e.g., women, racialized people) are usually less cited than other researchers belonging to dominating groups. This is usually due to the presence of citation biases in reference lists. These citation biases towards researchers from some socio-cultural groups may inevitably cause unfairness and inaccuracy in the assessment of articles impact. These citation biases may therefore translate to significant disparities in promotion, retention, grant funding, awards, collaborative opportunities, and publications. In this paper, we conduct the first study aiming at analyzing gendered citation practices in the software engineering (SE) literature. Our study allows reflecting on citations practices adopted in the SE field and serves as a starting point for more robust empirical studies on the analyzed topic. Our results show that some efforts still need to be done to achieve fairness in citation practices in the SE field. Such efforts may notably consist in the inclusion of citation diversity statements in manuscripts submitted for publication in SE journals and conferences.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the New Accessibility Crisis in Scholarly PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most scholarly works are distributed online in PDF format, which can present significant accessibility challenges for blind and low-vision readers. To characterize the scope of this issue, we perform a large-scale analysis of 20K open- and closed-access scholarly PDFs published between 2014-2023 sampled across broad fields of study. We assess the accessibility compliance of these documents based on six criteria: Default Language, Appropriate Nesting, Tagged PDF, Table Headers, Tab Order, and Alt-Text; selected based on prior work and the SIGACCESS Guide for Accessible PDFs. To ensure robustness, we corroborate our findings through automated accessibility checking, manual evaluation of alt text, comparative assessments with an alternate accessibility checker, and manual assessments with screen readers. Our findings reveal that less than 3.2% of tested PDFs satisfy all criteria, while a large majority (74.9%) fail to meet any criteria at all. Worse yet, we observe a concerning drop in PDF accessibility since 2019, largely among open-access papers, suggesting that efforts to improve document accessibility have not taken hold and are on a backslide. While investigating factors contributing to this drop, we identify key associations between fields of study, creation platforms used, models of publishing, and PDF accessibility compliance, suggesting that publisher and author choices significantly influence document accessibility. This paper highlights a new crisis in scholarly document accessibility and the need for a multi-faceted approach to address the problem, involving the development of better tools, enhanced author education, and systemic changes in academic publishing practices.</description>

      <title>Applying the FAIR Principles to Computational Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent trends within computational and data sciences show an increasing recognition and adoption of computational workflows as tools for productivity, reproducibility, and democratized access to platforms and processing know-how. As digital objects to be shared, discovered, and reused, computational workflows benefit from the FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Workflows Community Initiative's FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW), a global and open community of researchers and developers working with computational workflows across disciplines and domains, has systematically addressed the application of both FAIR data and software principles to computational workflows. We present our recommendations with commentary that reflects our discussions and justifies our choices and adaptations. Like the software and data principles on which they are based, these are offered to workflow users and authors, workflow management system developers, and providers of workflow services as guide rails for adoption and fodder for discussion. Workflows are becoming more prevalent as documented, automated instruments for data analysis, data collection, AI-based predictions, and simulations. The FAIR recommendations for workflows that we propose in this paper will maximize their value as research assets and facilitate their adoption by the wider community.</description>

      <title>Impact factors of astrophysics journals revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the 2024 impact factors of 36 most widely used journals in Astrophysics, using the citations collated by NASA/ADS (Astrophysics Data System) and compare them to the official impact factors. This includes journals which publish papers outside of astrophysics such as PRD, EPJC, Nature etc. We also propose a new metric to gauge the impact factor based on the median number of citations in a journal and calculate the same for all the journals. We find that the ADS-based impact factors are mostly in agreement, albeit higher than the official impact factors for most journals. The journals with the maximum fractional difference in median-based and old impact factors are JHEAP and PTEP. We find the maximum difference between the ADS and official impact factor for Nature.</description>
