      <title>Individual and group fairness in geographical partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Socioeconomic segregation often arises in school districting and other contexts, causing some groups to be over- or under-represented within a particular district. This phenomenon is closely linked with disparities in opportunities and outcomes. We formulate a new class of geographical partitioning problems in which the population is heterogeneous, and it is necessary to ensure fair representation for each group at each facility. We prove that the optimal solution is a novel generalization of the additively weighted Voronoi diagram, and we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to compute it, thus resolving an open question dating back to Dvoretzky et al. (1951). The efficacy and potential for practical insight of the approach are demonstrated in a realistic case study involving seven demographic groups and $78$ district offices.</description>

      <title>Institutional Learning and Volatility Transmission in ASEAN Equity Markets: A Network-Integrated Regime-Dependent Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how institutional learning and regional spillovers shape volatility dynamics in ASEAN equity markets. Using daily data for Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand from 2010 to 2024, we construct a high-frequency institutional learning index via a MIDAS-EPU approach. Unlike existing studies that treat institutional quality as a static background characteristic, this paper models institutions as a dynamic mechanism that reacts to policy shocks, information pressure, and crisis events. Building on this perspective, we introduce two new volatility frameworks: the Institutional Response Dynamics Model (IRDM), which embeds crisis memory, policy shocks, and information flows; and the Network-Integrated IRDM (N-IRDM), which incorporates dynamic-correlation and institutional-similarity networks to capture cross-market transmission. Empirical results show that institutional learning amplifies short-run sensitivity to shocks yet accelerates post-crisis normalization. Crisis-memory terms explain prolonged volatility clustering, while network interactions improve tail behavior and short-horizon forecasts. Robustness checks using placebo and lagged networks indicate that spillovers reflect a strong regional common factor rather than dependence on specific correlation topologies. Diebold-Mariano and ENCNEW tests confirm that the N-IRDM significantly outperforms baseline GARCH benchmarks. The findings highlight a dual role of institutions and offer policy insights on transparency enhancement, macroprudential communication, and coordinated regional governance.</description>

      <title>Big Wins, Small Net Gains: Direct and Spillover Effects of First Industry Entries in Puerto Rico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study how first sizable industry entries reshape local and neighboring labor markets in Puerto Rico. Using over a decade of quarterly municipality--industry data (2014Q1--2025Q1), I identify ``first sizable entries'' as large, persistent jumps in establishments, covered employment, and wage bill, and treat these as shocks to local industry presence at the municipio--industry level. Methodologically, I combine staggered-adoption difference-in-differences estimators that are robust to heterogeneous treatment timing with an imputation-based event-study approach, and I use a doubly robust difference-in-differences framework that explicitly allows for interference through pre-specified exposure mappings on a contiguity graph. The estimates show large and persistent direct gains in covered employment and wage bill in the treated municipality--industry cells over 0--16 quarters. Same-industry neighbors experience sizable short-run gains that reverse over the medium run, while within-municipality cross-industry and neighbor all-industries spillovers are small and imprecisely estimated. Once these spillovers are taken into account and spatially robust inference and sensitivity checks are applied, the net regional 0--16 quarter effect on covered employment is positive but modest in magnitude and estimated with considerable uncertainty. The results imply that first sizable entries generate substantial local gains where they occur, but much smaller and less precisely measured net employment gains for the broader regional economy, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial spillovers when evaluating place-based policies.</description>

      <title>Threshold Tensor Factor Model in CP Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new Threshold Tensor Factor Model in Canonical Polyadic (CP) form for tensor time series. By integrating a thresholding autoregressive structure for the latent factor process into the tensor factor model in CP form, the model captures regime-switching dynamics in the latent factor processes while retaining the parsimony and interpretability of low-rank tensor representations. We develop estimation procedures for the model and establish the theoretical properties of the resulting estimators. Numerical experiments and a real-data application illustrate the practical performance and usefulness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity in peer effects for binary outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I introduce heterogeneity into the analysis of peer effects that arise from conformity, allowing the strength of the taste for conformity to vary across agents' actions. Using a structural model based on a simultaneous network game with incomplete information, I derive conditions for equilibrium uniqueness and for the identification of heterogeneous peer-effect parameters. I also propose specification tests to determine whether the conformity model or the spillover model is consistent with the observed data in the presence of heterogeneous peer effects. Applying the model to data on smoking and alcohol consumption among secondary school students, I show that assuming a homogeneous preference for conformity leads to biased estimates.</description>

      <title>Multiple Randomization Designs: Estimation and Inference with Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study we introduce a new class of experimental designs. In a classical randomized controlled trial (RCT), or A/B test, a randomly selected subset of a population of units (e.g., individuals, plots of land, or experiences) is assigned to a treatment (treatment A), and the remainder of the population is assigned to the control treatment (treatment B). The difference in average outcome by treatment group is an estimate of the average effect of the treatment. However, motivating our study, the setting for modern experiments is often different, with the outcomes and treatment assignments indexed by multiple populations. For example, outcomes may be indexed by buyers and sellers, by content creators and subscribers, by drivers and riders, or by travelers and airlines and travel agents, with treatments potentially varying across these indices. Spillovers or interference can arise from interactions between units across populations. For example, sellers' behavior may depend on buyers' treatment assignment, or vice versa. This can invalidate the simple comparison of means as an estimator for the average effect of the treatment in classical RCTs. We propose new experiment designs for settings in which multiple populations interact. We show how these designs allow us to study questions about interference that cannot be answered by classical randomized experiments. Finally, we develop new statistical methods for analyzing these Multiple Randomization Designs.</description>
