      <title>Polarized and unpolarized gluon PDFs: generative machine learning applications for lattice QCD matrix elements at short distance and large momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations share a defining challenge by requiring a small finite range of spatial separation $z$ between quark/gluon bilinears for controllable power corrections in the perturbative QCD factorization, and a large hadron boost $p_z$ for a successful determination of collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). However, these two requirements make the determination of PDFs from lattice data very challenging. We present the application of generative machine learning algorithms to estimate the polarized and unpolarized gluon correlation functions utilizing short-distance data and extending the correlation up to $zp_z \lesssim 14$, surpassing the current capabilities of lattice QCD calculations. We train physics-informed machine learning algorithms to learn from the short-distance correlation at $z\lesssim 0.36$ fm and take the limit, $p_z \to \infty$, thereby minimizing possible contamination from the higher-twist effects for a successful reconstruction of the polarized gluon PDF. We also expose the bias and problems with underestimating uncertainties associated with the use of model-dependent and overly constrained functional forms, such as $x^\alpha(1-x)^\beta$ and its variants to extract PDFs from the lattice data. We propose the use of generative machine learning algorithms to mitigate these issues and present our determination of the polarized and unpolarized gluon PDFs in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit for $\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory at nonzero baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory is the simplest discrete gauge theory with three-quark bound states, i.e., baryons. Since it has a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, it can be used for testing quantum simulation of lattice gauge theory at nonzero baryon density. We discuss global and local gauge symmetries and their importance in quantum simulation. We perform quantum emulator calculation and demonstrate how to study the ground state property of baryonic matter.</description>

      <title>Localized Chiral Magnetic Effect in equilibrium QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of a non-uniform magnetic background field on the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in equilibrium QCD using lattice simulations with 2+1 flavors of dynamical staggered quarks at the physical point. We show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field the CME manifests itself via a localized electromagnetic current density along the direction of the field, which integrates to zero over the full volume. Our primary observable is the leading-order coefficient of the current in a chiral chemical potential expansion, which we compute for various lattice spacings and extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our findings demonstrate that, even though the global spatial average of the CME conductivity vanishes in equilibrium, steady currents still exist locally. Thus, spatially modulated magnetic fields provide a possible way of generating a non-trivial CME signal in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A Variational Approach to Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strongly coupled field theories, perturbation theory cannot be employed to study the low-energy spectrum. Thus, non-perturbative techniques are required. We employ the variational method, a rigorous, non-perturbative approach which provides variational upper bounds on the energy eigenstates of the theory. An essential step in the variational method is the choice of trial wave function. In this work, we study the viability of employing a neural network as our variational ansatz. As a first step towards phenomenologically interesting strongly coupled theories like quantum chromodynamics, we study scalar field theories with quartic couplings.</description>

      <title>A neural network study of the phase transitions of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts models on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical phenomena of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice with $q=2,3,4$ are investigated using the techniques of neural networks (NN). In particular, an unconventional supervised NN which is trained using no information about the physics of the considered systems is employed. In addition, conventional unsupervised autoencoders (AECs) are used in our study as well. Remarkably, while the conventional AECs fail to uncover the critical phenomena of the systems investigated here, our unconventional supervised NN correctly identifies the critical behaviors of all three considered antiferromagnetic $q$-state models. The results obtained in this study suggest convincingly that the applicability of our unconventional supervised NN is broader than one anticipates. In particular, when a new system is studied with our NN, it is likely that it is not necessary to conduct any training, and one only needs to examine whether an appropriate reduced representation of the original raw configurations exists, so that the same already trained NN can be employed to explore the related phase transition efficiently.</description>

      <title>Nucleon tomography and total angular momentum of valence quarks from synergy between lattice QCD and elastic scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exploratory work on integrating lattice-QCD results with experimental data for elastic scattering. Within the framework of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), this approach allows for the extraction of detailed information about nucleon tomography and the total angular momentum carried by valence quarks. To accomplish this reliably, we introduce a new quantity, the "double ratio", which significantly reduces the systematic uncertainties inherent in lattice QCD computations. Moreover, we introduce a "shadow" term in the extraction procedure, which is sensitive only to lattice-QCD results. This term allows us to investigate the model dependence of the extraction, providing a more flexible description of the nucleon that goes beyond the previously considered bell-shaped distribution.</description>

      <title>Heavy four-quark mesons $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$: Scalar particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameters of the heavy four-quark scalar meson $T_{\mathrm{bc\overline{b} \overline{c}}}$ with content $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are calculated by means of the sum rule method. This structure is considered as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark and antidiquark components. The mass and current coupling of $T_{\mathrm{bc\overline{b} \overline{c}}}$ are evaluated in the context of the two-point sum rule approach. The full width of this tetraquark is estimated by taking into account two types of its possible strong decay channels. First class includes dissociation of $T_{\mathrm{bc\overline{b}\overline{c}}} $ to mesons $\eta_c\eta_{b}$, $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$, $B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $B_{c}^{+}(1^3P_{0})B_{c}^{\ast-}$. Another type of processes are generated by annihilations $\overline{b}b \to \overline{q}q$ of constituent $ b$-quarks which produces the final-state charmed meson pairs $D^{+}D^{-}$, $ D^{0} \overline{D}^{0}$, $D^{*+}D^{*-}$, and $D^{*0}\overline{D}^{*0}$. Partial width all of these decays are found using the three-point sum rule method which is required to calculate strong couplings at corresponding meson-meson-tetraquark vertices. Predictions obtained for the mass $m=(12697 \pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T_{\mathrm{bc\overline{b}\overline{c} }}]=(142.4 \pm 16.9)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of this state are compared with alternative results, and are useful for further experimental investigations of fully heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>
