      <title>Fast Rank Adaptive CUR via a Recycled Small Sketch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of accurate low-rank matrix approximations is central to improving the scalability of various techniques in machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and control. Traditionally, low-rank approximations are constructed using SVD-based approaches such as truncated SVD or RandomizedSVD. Although these SVD approaches -- especially RandomizedSVD -- have proven to be very computationally efficient, other low-rank approximation methods can offer even greater performance. One such approach is the CUR decomposition, which forms a low-rank approximation using direct row and column subsets of a matrix. Because CUR uses direct matrix subsets, it is also often better able to preserve native matrix structures like sparsity or non-negativity than SVD-based approaches and can facilitate data interpretation in many contexts. This paper introduces IterativeCUR, which draws on previous work in randomized numerical linear algebra to build a new algorithm that is highly competitive compared to prior work: (1) It is adaptive in the sense that it takes as an input parameter the desired tolerance, rather than an a priori guess of the numerical rank. (2) It typically runs significantly faster than both existing CUR algorithms and techniques such as RandomizedSVD, in particular when these methods are run in an adaptive rank mode. Its asymptotic complexity is $\mathcal{O}(mn + (m+n)r^2 + r^3)$ for an $m\times n$ matrix of numerical rank $r$. (3) It relies on a single small sketch from the matrix that is successively downdated as the algorithm proceeds.
  We demonstrate through extensive experiments that IterativeCUR achieves up to $4\times$ speed-up over state-of-the-art pivoting-on-sketch approaches with no loss of accuracy, and up to $40\times$ speed-up over rank-adaptive randomized SVD approaches.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Bayesian Solution of the Empirical Stochastic Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic inverse problem is a key ingredient in making inferences, predictions, and decisions for complex science and engineering systems. We formulate and analyze a nonparametric Bayesian solution for the stochastic inverse problem. Key properties of the solution are proved and the convergence and error of a computational solution obtained by random sampling is analyzed. Several applications illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo on a single sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Monte Carlo simulation method (MinMC) that approximates prices and risk measures for a range $\Gamma$ of model parameters at once. The simulation method that we study has recently gained popularity [HS20, FPP22, BDG24], and we provide a theoretical framework and convergence rates for it. In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[X]$, where $\theta$ denotes the model and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}$ the expectation with respect to the distribution $P_\theta$ of the model $\theta$, can be obtained across all $\theta \in \Gamma$ by minimizing a map $V:H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $H$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of $\theta$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.</description>
