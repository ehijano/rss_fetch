      <title>Parasitic RF-SQUIDs in superconducting qubits due to wirebonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits show great promise to realize practical quantum computers from micro-fabricated integrated circuits. However, their solid-state architecture bears the burden of parasitic modes in qubit materials and the control circuitry which cause decoherence and interfere with qubits. Here, we present evidence that wirebonds, which are used to contact the micro-circuits and to realize chip-to-chip airbridges, may contain parasitic Josephson junctions. In our experiment, such a junction was enclosed in a superconducting loop and so gave rise to the formation an RF-SQUID which interfered with a nearby flux-tunable transmon qubit. Periodic signatures observed in magnetic field sweeps revealed a strong AC-dispersive coupling of the parasitic RF-SQUID to both the qubit and its readout resonator, in addition to the DC-inductive coupling between RF-SQUID and qubit. Our finding sheds light on a previously unknown origin of decoherence due to parasitic Josephson junctions in superconducing circuits.</description>

      <title>All fractional Shapiro steps in the RSJ model with two Josephson harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Proximity engineering and interferometric quantification of a non-volatile anomalous phase-shift in zero-field polarity-reversible Josephson diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent realization of zero-field polarity-reversible supercurrent rectification in proximity-magnetized Rashba(-type) Pt Josephson junctions (JJs)5 promises its practical applications for superconducting logic circuits and cryogenic memories. Here, by substituting the Pt Josephson barrier for either 5d or 4d element proximity layer with different (para-)magnetic susceptibility, spin-orbit coupling and electronic band structure, we identify the proximity role of the Josephson barrier in determining the zero-field diode properties. Ta (W) JJs reveal the zero-field diode efficiency of ~17 (~5)% at 2 K, slightly (much) smaller than that of the Pt JJs. Notably, the zero-field diode polarity of Ta and W JJs turns out to be opposite to the Pt JJs. Our results, along with a large zero-field diode efficiency found in highly magnetic-susceptible Pd JJs and a non-volatile anomalous phase-shift {\phi}_0 probed by superconducting quantum interferometry, demonstrate the {\phi}_0-tuning of zero-field diode performance via proximity engineering of interface magnetic ordering and Rashba effect.</description>

      <title>Majorana Zero Mode Induced by a Screw Dislocation on the Surface of an Iron-based Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple scenario to describe a dislocation-induced Majorana zero mode on the surface of an iron-based superconductor, using an illustrative model with a cylindrical hole of radius $R$ perpendicular to its top surface. Topological surface states on the inner surface of the hole form an effective chiral $p$-wave superconductor. When the top surface has a perpendicular magnetization, chiral Majorana modes appear near the circular edge of the hole. Since the corresponding wavefunctions obey an antiperiodic boundary condition in the circumferential direction, a Majorana zero mode at zero energy does not appear. However, if a screw dislocation is inserted through the hole, the antiperiodic boundary condition is transformed into a periodic one, resulting in the appearance of a Majorana zero mode. This Majorana zero mode remains in the no-hole limit of $R \to 0$. We confirm this scenario by numerical simulation and effective theory. A method of creating a Majorana zero mode in the absence of the surface magnetization is briefly described.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Dependence of the Spin Susceptibility on Conventional s-wave Superconductor LaRu$_4$P$_{12}$ Revealed by $^{31}$P-NMR and $^{139}$La-NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field dependence of the spin part of Knight shift, which is proportional to the superconducting-state spin susceptibility, was investigated at two nuclear sites, $^{31}$P and $^{139}$La in a conventional s-wave superconductor LaRu$_4$P$_{12}$. After the analyses, we confirmed that the superconducting-state spin susceptibility is proportional to magnetic field, and connects to the normal-state spin susceptibility smoothly. This is a textbook example, when the superconductivity is broken with the orbital pair-breaking effect.</description>

      <title>A Thermally Modulated SINIS Trasconductance Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a superconducting transconductance amplifier based on the thermal modulation of a SINIS (Superconductor-Insulator-Normal metal-Insulator-Superconductor) configuration. The device is composed of a normal metal island interfaced with two superconducting leads through tunnel barriers, establishing a voltage-biased symmetric SINIS setup. An additional NIS junction connects the island to a third superconducting lead, which serves as input. When the input voltage surpasses the superconducting gap, the resultant injection of quasiparticles increases the electronic temperature of the island, thereby modulating the SINIS current. We perform numerical analyzes of the device performance, influenced by input voltage, frequency, and bath temperature. At bath temperatures below 250 mK, the device shows a transconductance exceeding 4 mS and a current gain exceeding 45 dB. Both gain and transconductance maintain their levels up to 1 MHz, but decrease at higher frequencies, with a -3 dB cutoff around 10 MHz, and an average power dissipation of approximately 5 nW. Our simulations reveal a fully voltage-controlled, three-terminal superconducting amplifier characterized by high transconductance and gain, achieved through thermally mediated signal transduction. This architectural design presents a promising avenue for cryogenic amplification with reduced power dissipation and compatibility with current superconducting electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Acoustogalvanic Effect in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered twisted bilayer superconductors have suffered from a lack of reliable methods for identifying their nontrivial pairing symmetries and quantum geometry. In this study, we propose nonlinear responses driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe to access exotic Bogoliubov quasiparticles in such superconductors. Our approach is particularly suitable for addressing the superconducting gap structure as the gap energies in these systems typically lie within the frequency range of surface acoustic waves, and thus paves the way toward the experimental identification of exotic superconducting states especially in low-$T_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Quantized Transport of Disordered Superconducting $\nu=2/3$ Fractional Quantum Hall Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states, which have counter-propagating modes, are known to flow under relevant neutral disorders into a stable Kane-Fisher-Polchinski (KFP) renormalization group (RG) fixed point, which yields a quantized two-terminal conductance $\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^2}{h}$ consistent with the experiments. Motivated by growing interests in superconducting (SC) quantum Hall systems, we study the $\nu=2/3$ FQH edge states with disordered SC proximity by generalizing the KFP analysis, which may also apply to the recently realized $\nu=2/3$ fractional Chern insulator. We show that the $\nu=2/3$ FQH edge theory has an infinite number of stable RG fixed points SC$_N$ labeled by an integer $N\in\mathbb{Z}$, each of which is driven by a relevant disordered charge-$2q_N$ SC tunneling with $q_N\in\mathbb{Z}$ depending on $N$. The $N&lt;0$ ($N\ge0$) phases are favored by an attractive (repulsive) inter-mode interaction on the edge. We further predict that the edge states in a SC$_N$ phase with $q_N\neq0$ yields a quantized downstream resistance $R_d=\frac{h}{2q_N^2e^2}$ measurable in a FQH-SC junction. For edge states staying in the KFP phase ($N=0$ and $q_N=0$) under SC proximity, we arrive at a nonlinear $R_d\propto V^{-\alpha}$ or $T^{-\alpha}$ with voltage bias $V$ or temperature $T$, where $\alpha=4$ ($\alpha=1$) if pairing (vortex tunneling) dominates.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic pressure studies on non-superconducting UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the temperature-pressure phase diagram of a UTe$_2$ single crystal that does not undergo a bulk superconducting transition but shows filamentary superconductivity with a critical transition temperature of 1 K at ambient pressure. Electrical-resistivity measurements reveal that the evolution of the filamentary superconducting state under pressure resembles the behavior observed in previous reports on bulk superconducting samples. AC calorimetry, however, does not show evidence for either bulk superconductivity or magnetism for pressures up to 1.6 GPa. Our results highlight the role of inhomogeneity in chemical-vapor-transport-grown UTe$_2$ samples and serve as a cautionary tale when probing electrical resistivity alone.</description>

      <title>Anomalous supercurrents in the presence of particle losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that supercurrent properties in a superfluid or superconducting junction are significantly modified due to single-particle losses present in a conduction channel. In the presence of a spin-independent particle loss, we find regimes where the Josephson current $I_N(\phi)$ takes zero at a position in between $\phi= 0$ and $\phi=\pi$, and the direction of the supercurrent is reversed. Although the region is narrow, we also find a regime in which the critical current is enhanced by dissipation. Such anomalous behaviors in the Josephson current are attributed to a subtle interplay between the contribution that is present regardless of dissipation and the unconventional one that is absent without dissipation. In the presence of a spin-selective particle loss, it is shown that a dissipation-induced spin supercurrent and its reversal occur. The proposed system is analyzed by means of the Keldysh field theory approach based on the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudershan-Lindblad master equation and may be realized in ultracold atomic gases and solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Level Pinning of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov States in a Superconductor with Weakly Broken Spin-Rotational Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As is well known, magnetic impurities adsorbed on superconductors, e.g. of the s-wave type, can introduce a bound gap-state (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonance). We here investigate within a minimal model how the impurity moment arranges with respect to a weak homogeneous internal magnetic field employing a fully self-consistent mean-field treatment. Our investigation reveals a critical window of impurity-to-substrate coupling constants, $J$. The width of the critical region, $\delta J$, scales like $\delta J \sim B/\Delta$, where $B$ is the magnitude of the internal field, that breaks the spin-rotation symmetry, and $\Delta$ is the bulk order parameter. While tuning $J$ through the window, the energy of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) resonance is pinned to the Fermi energy $\varepsilon_{\rm F}$ and the impurity moment rotates in a continuous fashion. We emphasize the pivotal role of self-consistency: In treatments ignoring self-consistency, the critical window adopts zero width, $\delta J=0$; consequently, there is no pinning of the YSR-resonance to $\varepsilon_{\rm F}$, the impurity orientation jumps and therefore this orientation cannot be controlled continuously by fine-tuning the coupling $J$. In this sense, our study highlights the significance of self-consistency for understanding intricate magnetic interactions between superconductive materials and Shiba chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate novel laser-induced relaxation oscillations in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). These oscillations appear when a voltage biased NbTiN nanobridge detector is illuminated with intense pulsed laser light at a repetition rate of $\sim19\text{MHz}$. They differ from the well-known relaxation oscillations by a step-wise increase in frequency and phase locking of the oscillations to the laser pulses. We create a model that incorporates electrical feedback and excludes thermal effects to simulate and explain the origin of the observed laser-induced relaxation oscillations. Qualitative agreement to the experiment is achieved using realistic values for the parameters in the model.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electron-phonon interactions in Migdal-Eliashberg theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting systems based on attractive electron-phonon interactions are the ones which are best understood at a fundamental level. They are well described using Eliashberg theory, which, unlike BCS theory, explicitly takes into account phonon dynamics. It is most often assumed that only linear electron-phonon interactions are relevant. However, for some superconductors like MgB$_2$ or hydride based superconductors, nonlinear electron-phonon interactions are known to contribute significantly, which is not taken into account in conventional Eliashberg theory. We provide a modification to Eliashberg theory by introducing nonlinear electron-phonon interactions. We show that the Eliashberg equations remain unchanged apart from a nonlinear extension of the Eliashberg spectral function. This extended spectral function can be used as a baseline for future ab initio calculations. We use it to construct an analytical toy model and show that the nonlinear electron-phonon coupling affects the superconducting gap function on the imaginary and real axis and causes an increase in the superconducting critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed that superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can emerge from a valley-polarized and, hence, chiral normal state. The interplay of pairing and the reduced normal-state symmetries sparked widespread interest. In this work, we demonstrate within a microscopic theoretical formalism that this stabilizes a non-reciprocal superconducting state. Our results are based on a fully self-consistent framework for determining the superconducting order parameter from a Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. We show that the system displays a sizeable intrinsic superconducting diode effect, i.e., without the need for applying external magnetic fields, which is also highly tunable by an external displacement field. Moreover, we find that the angular dependence of the critical current is highly sensitive to the Fermi surfaces of the normal state. Hence, our results suggest that the critical current could provide insights into the type of Fermi surface topology from which superconductivity arises.</description>

      <title>Topological electron and phonon flat bands in novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba)</title>

Abstract: Fermionic and bosonic localized states induced by geometric frustration in the kagome lattice provide a distinctive research platform for investigating emergent exotic quantum phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Here, we report the discovery of coexisting electronic and phononic flat bands induced by geometric frustration in a novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba). The electronic flat band is located around the Fermi level and possesses a nontrivial topological invariant with Z2=1. Additionaly, we identify multiple van Hove singularities (vHS) arise from the kagome Pd d orbitals with distinct dispersion and sublattice features, including conventional, higher-order vHS and p-type, m-type vHS. Specifically, our investigation of the vibrational modes of the phononic flat band reveals that its formation originates from destructive interference between adjacent kagome lattice sites with antiphase vibrational modes. A spring-mass model of phonons is established to probe the physical mechanism of the phononic flat bands. Furthermore, the calculations of electron-phonon coupling in the XPd5 reveal superconducting ground states with critical temperatures (Tc) of 4.25 K, 2.75 K, and 3.35 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively. This work provides a promising platform to explore the Fermion-boson many-body interplay and superconducting states, while simultaneously establishing a novel analytical framework to elucidate the origin of phononic flat bands in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics using a superconducting flux qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit, which is capable of reaching strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes, as shown in previous studies. Here, we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with two cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude those in earlier experiments. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current mediated by photons by applying magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, our experiment opens new possibilities for quantum thermodynamics, aiming to realize true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, by leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and its environment in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Theory of the photonic Joule effect in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a small system is coupled to a bath, it is generally assumed that the state of the bath remains unaffected by the system due to the bath's large number of degrees of freedom. Here we show theoretically that this assumption can be easily violated for photonic baths typically used in experiments involving superconducting circuits. We analyze the dynamics of a voltage-biased Josephson junction coupled to a photonic bath, represented as a long Josephson junction chain. Our findings show that the system can reach a non-equilibrium steady state where the photonic degrees of freedom become significantly overheated, leading to a qualitative change in the current-voltage $I-V$ curve. This phenomenon is analogous to the Joule effect observed in electrical conductors, where flowing current can substantially heat up electrons. Recognizing this effect is crucial for the many applications of high-impedance environments in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement-induced superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current study is motivated by a difficulty to reconcile between particle number conservation and superconductivity. An alternative modeling, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously ocuurs in quantum systems, is explored. The Fermi-Hubbard mode is employed to demonstrate a disentanglement-induced quantum phase transition into a state having a finite superconducting order parameter. Moreover, the effect of disentanglement on Josephson junction's current phase relation is explored.</description>
