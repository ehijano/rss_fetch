      <title>Computational analysis reveals historical trajectory of East-Polynesian lunar calendars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a type of lunar calendar known as lists of the 'nights of the moon', found throughout East Polynesia, including Rapa Nui (Easter Island). Using computational methods, we analyzed the lexical and structural divergence of 49 calendric lists from all major archipelagos, each containing about 30 night names. Our results, presented as a rooted phylogenetic tree, show a clear split into two main groups: one including lists from Rapa Nui, Mangareva, and the Marquesas; the other comprising lists from New Zealand, Hawaii, the Cook Islands, the Austral Islands, Tahiti, and the Tuamotu. This pattern aligns with a recent alternative classification of East Polynesian languages into 'Distal' (Marquesan, Mangarevan, Rapanui) and 'Proximal' (Maori, Hawaiian, Tahitian, etc.) subgroups. Since both language and lunar calendars are symbolic systems passed down and changed within communities - and given the geographic isolation of many archipelagos - we interpret this correspondence as evidence that the early divergence of East Polynesian lunar calendars mirrors early population movements and language splits in the region.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Biofilm Eradication Using Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a model for antibiotic resistance transfer in a bacterial biofilm and examine antibiotic dosing strategies that are effective in bacterial elimination. In particular, we consider a 1-D model of a biofilm with susceptible, persistor and resistant bacteria. Resistance can be transferred to the susceptible bacteria via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), specifically via conjugation. We analyze some basic properties of the model, determine the conditions for existence of disinfection and coexistence states, including boundary equilibria and their stability. Numerical simulations are performed to explore different modeling scenarios and support our theoretical findings. Different antibiotic dosing strategies are then studied, starting with a continuous dosing; here we note that high doses of antibiotic are needed for bacterial elimination. We then consider periodic dosing, and again observe that insufficient levels of antibiotic per dose may lead to treatment failure. Finally, using an extended version of Pontryagin's maximum principle we determine efficient antibiotic dosing protocols, which ensure bacterial elimination while keeping the total dosing low; we note that this involves a tapered dosing which reinforces results presented in other clinical and modeling studies. We study the optimal dosing for different parameter values and note that the optimal dosing schedule is qualitatively robust.</description>

      <title>Long-term impact of PM2.5 on mortality is exacerbated when wildfire events occur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is extensive evidence that long-term exposure to all-source PM2.5 increases mortality. However, to date, no study has evaluated whether this effect is exacerbated in the presence of wildfire events. Here, we study 60+ million older US adults and find that wildfire events increase the harmful effects of long-term all-source PM2.5 exposure on mortality, providing a new and realistic conceptualization of wildfire health risks.</description>
