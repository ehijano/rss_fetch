      <title>Vortex solitons in quasi-phase-matched photonic crystals with the third harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report stable composite vortex solitons in the model of a three-dimensional photonic crystal with the third-harmonic (TH) generation provided by the quasi-phase-matched quadratic nonlinearity. The photonic crystal is designed with a checkerboard structure in the $\left( x\text{,}% y\right) $ plane, while the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $d(z)$, is modulated along the propagation direction as a chains of rectangles with two different periods. This structure can be fabricated by means of available technologies. The composite vortex solitons are built of fundamental-frequency (FF), second-harmonic (SH), and TH components, exhibiting spatial patterns which correspond to vortex with topological charges $s=1$, a quadrupole with $s=2$, and an anti-vortex structure with $s = -1$, respectively. The soliton profiles feature rhombic or square patterns, corresponding to phase-matching conditions $\varphi =0$ or $\pi $, respectively, the rhombic solitons possessing a broader stability region. From the perspective of the experimental feasibility, we show that both the rhombic and square-shaped composite vortex solitons may readily propagate in the photonic crystals over distances up to $\sim 1$ m. The TH component of the soliton with $s=\mp 1$ is produced by the cascaded nonlinear interactions, starting from the FF vortex component with $s=\pm 1$ and proceeding through the quadrupole SH one with $s=2$. These findings offer a novel approach for the creation and control of stable vortex solitons in nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Navigating with Stability: Local Minima, Patterns, and Evolution in a Gradient Damage Fracture Model</title>

Abstract: We investigate the computation of stable fracture paths in brittle thin films using one-dimensional damage models with an elastic foundation. The underlying variational formulation is non-convex, making the evolution path sensitive to algorithmic choices. In this paper, we inquire into the effectiveness of quasi-Newton algorithms as an alternative to conventional Newton-Raphson solvers. These algorithms improve convergence by constructing a positive definite approximation of the Hessian, trading improved convergence for the risk of missing bifurcation points and stability thresholds. In the absence of irreversibility constraints, we construct an equilibrium map that represents all stable and unstable equilibrium states as a function of the external load, using well-known branch-following bifurcation techniques. Our main finding is that quasi-Newton algorithms fail to select stable evolution paths without exact second variation information. To overcome this, we introduce a spectral stability criterion based on the full Hessian, which enables the identification of optimal perturbations and improves path-following accuracy. We then extend our analysis to the irreversible case, where admissible perturbations are constrained to a cone. We develop a nonlinear constrained eigenvalue solver to compute the minimal eigenmode within this restricted space and show that it plays a key role in distinguishing physical instabilities from numerical artefacts. Our results provide practical guidance for robust computation of fracture paths in irreversible, non-convex settings.</description>
