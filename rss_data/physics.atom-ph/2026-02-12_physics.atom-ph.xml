      <title>Electron-impact cross sections for dissociation processes of vibrationally excited CH radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the cross sections for dissociative electron attachment and dissociative excitation processes in vibrationally excited CH radicals induced by electron impact. Resonant electron-CH collisions are analyzed using the ab-initio R-matrix method, while nuclear dynamics are explored within the Local Complex Potential framework. A comprehensive set of vibrationally resolved cross sections and rate coefficients is provided for both the ground and first excited electronic states of the CH molecule. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the kinetics of non-equilibrium systems containing CH molecules with applications in plasma technologies for CO2 reduction, combustion processes and various astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>High-voltage generation system for a traveling-wave Stark decelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the high-voltage generation system we have developed for a traveling-wave Stark decelerator (TWSD). The TWSD can reduce the forward velocity of a molecular beam of heavy neutral polar molecules such as strontium monofluoride (SrF) and barium monofluoride (BaF) from $\sim$ 200 m/s down to $\sim$ 6 m/s. The main motivation for the development of this device is the increased sensitivity from precision spectroscopy of the decelerated molecules to test fundamental physics. The high-voltage generation system can produce eight pulsed sinusoidal waveforms with a maximum amplitude of 10 kV and a linear frequency sweep from 16.7 kHz down to 500 Hz over the span of 40 ms at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The eight waveforms are phase-offset to each other by 45 degrees. To slow down the heavy molecules, the decelerator is required to have a length of $\sim$ 4 m, which results in a significant capacitive coupling between adjacent channels of $\sim$ 160 pF. As a consequence, the control and stability of the waveforms is extra challenging. We designed a method that compensates for the frequency-dependent coupling between the eight channels. Allowing for amplitude and phase-offsets that do not deviate more than 1% and 2 degrees, respectively, from their design values during the frequency sweep. The system outperforms commercially available options in terms of stability, output voltage amplitude, cost and ease of maintenance. This approach is also relevant for other fields where precise control of high-voltage waveforms is required, such as particle accelerator physics, plasma physics and mass spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Probe-assisted Depopulation Pumping in Low-pressure Alkali-metal Vapor Cells for Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For precision atomic magnetometry, inert buffer gas is included in alkali-metal vapor cells to significantly broaden hyperfine transitions, which facilitates optical pumping and reduces diffusive relaxation, while also providing non-radiative excited state quenching. We show low-buffer gas pressure (below 50 Torr) alkali vapor cells with resolved hyperfine manifolds can also yield high-performance magnetometers. For high polarization in $^{87}$Rb, we optically pump $F=2$ states with narrow linewidth $\sigma_+$ light, while tuning a probe beam to depopulate $F=1$ states ($\Delta\nu = 6.8$ GHz from $F=2$). The probe tuning then also provides $F=2$ detection with high optical rotation and low probe broadening; we demonstrate top-bottom gradiometry, within a single 25 Torr, 0.5 cc cell, that yields an Earth's field free-precession magnetometer sensitivity of 18 fT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ with a 1 kHz bandwidth, as well as RF magnetometer sensitivity of 12 fT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ in a small band about 110 kHz.</description>

      <title>Field-Deployable Hybrid Gravimetry: Projecting Absolute Accuracy Across a Remote 24km$^2$ Survey via Daily Quantum Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absolute gravimeters deliver drift-free, high-precision measurements but are typically bulky and difficult to deploy, whereas relative gravimeters are lightweight and mobile but intrinsically limited by time-dependent drift. We demonstrate a hybrid quantum-enabled gravimetry approach in which an on-site atomic gravimeter provides routine, $\mu$Gal-level calibration of two mobile spring gravimeters during a field survey spanning 24 km$^2$ of dense tropical terrain. The atomic reference enables high-precision, asynchronous cross-comparison of relative measurements acquired over seven days, effectively suppressing instrumental drift to a level required for demanding geophysical applications. This deployment captures regional gravity gradients with high fidelity under challenging environmental conditions, illustrating how field-operable quantum sensors can extend quantum-grade gravimetry beyond laboratory settings and serve as scalable calibration backbones for large-area, high-precision geophysical surveys in remote or logistically constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of matter-wave four-wave mixing in $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates with tunable interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate four-wave mixing (FWM) of matter waves in two geometric configurations in $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates with the atomic interaction tuned via Feshbach resonances. For one configuration with the single-spin component, the FWM yield increases with a larger scattering length. For the two-spin component configuration, we specifically investigate FWM in both the droplet and gas parameter regimes. We find that the FWM yield reaches its maximum near the critical parameter region between the gas and droplet phases. Our research can help to optimize the FWM yield for matter-wave amplification and entangled atom pair generation, making it conducive to applications in quantum information processing and precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Evanescent-Field Atom Guides on Optical Nanofiber Testbeds for Benchmarking Membrane-Waveguide Photonic Integrated Circuit Platforms Toward On-Chip Quantum Inertial Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in cold atom interferometry with atom guides have set the stage for miniaturized quantum inertial sensors capable of operating in dynamic environments. In this work, we combine three key innovations - evanescent-field (EF) atom guides, optical nanofiber (NF) testbeds, and membrane-waveguide photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platforms - to advance EF-guided atom interferometry. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of EF atom guides on optical NF testbeds, providing a mean to benchmark membrane-waveguide PIC platforms. Second, we achieve low-power (~5 mW) guiding of freely moving, laser-cooled 133Cs atoms in two-color, traveling-wave EF optical dipole traps at the magic wavelengths of 793 nm and 937 nm - referred to here as 793/937-nm EF atom guides - in contrast to conventional 685/937-nm standing-wave EF optical lattices. The 793/937-nm EF atom guides map directly onto the membrane-waveguide PIC platforms, which can safely handle up to 4-6x times the minimum trap power under vacuum and enable dense cold atom generation for efficient loading into the EF atom guides. Third, we verify preserved atomic coherence via microwave fields and EF-coupled Doppler-free Raman beams. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coherence fringes driven by co-propagating EF-coupled Raman beams with only 150 nW of total optical power. By forging a direct link between optical NF testbeds to membrane-waveguide PIC platforms, our results lay critical groundwork for the on-chip realization of EF-guided atom interferometry and for fully integrated, low-SWaP (size, weight, and power) quantum accelerometers and gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Nonpertubative Many-Body Theory for the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model at Low Temperature: From Weak to Strong Coupling Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In theoretical studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems, the Mermin-Wagner theorem prevents continuous symmetry breaking at any finite temperature, thus forbidding a Landau phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$. The difficulty arises when many-body theoretical studies predict a Landau phase transition at finite temperatures, which contradicts the Mermin-Wagner theorem and is termed a pseudo phase transition. To tackle this problem, we systematically develop a symmetrization scheme, defined as averaging physical quantities over all symmetry-breaking states, thus ensuring that it preserves the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We apply the symmetrization scheme to the GW-covariance calculation for the 2D repulsive Hubbard model at half-filling in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime and at low temperatures, obtaining the one-body Green's function and spin-spin correlation function, and benchmark them against Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) with good agreement.The spin-spin correlation functions are approached within the covariance theory, a general method for calculating two-body correlation functions from a one-particle starting point, such as the GW formalism used here, which ensures the preservation of the fundamental fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) and Ward-Takahashi identities (WTI). With the FDR and WTI satisfied, we conjecture that the $\chi$-sum rule, a fundamental relation from the Pauli exclusion principle, can be used to probe the reliability of many-body methods, and demonstrate this by comparing the GW-covariance and mean-field-covariance approaches. This work provides a novel framework to investigate the strong-coupling and doped regime of the 2D Hubbard model, which is believed to be applicable to real high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Hidden Kinematics and Dual Quantum References in Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin resonance phenomena are conventionally described using transition probabilities formulated in a rotating frame, whose physical meaning implicitly depends on the choice of quantum reference standard. In this Colloquium, we show that a spin in a rotating magnetic field constitutes a configuration involving two quantum descriptions that share a common quantization operator but differ in their kinematic and dynamical roles. The transition probability therefore emerges as a relational quantity between quantum reference standards rather than an intrinsic property of a single evolving spin state. By incorporating the kinematic motion of the spin vector together with the dynamical evolution, this framework restores consistent energy accounting and reveals the dual-reference structure underlying spin dynamics in rotating magnetic fields.</description>
