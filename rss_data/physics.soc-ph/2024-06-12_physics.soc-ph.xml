      <title>Universal spatial inflation of human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between egocentric preference and urban structure in shaping human mobility has profound implications for improving epidemic intervention, social equity, and urban resilience. However, numerous existing studies either solely identify the egocentric preferences -- the anchoring effects from home -- or the impact of hierarchical urban structures. Here, we propose a network-based approach to present human mobility in both spatial and topological aspects within the urban system, using cell phone trajectory data from millions of users across three countries. By segmenting mobility trajectories into modules and examining their overlap with urban scales, we have observed the inflation law that the geospatial extent of these modules increases sub-linearly with their distance from home. Moreover, the egocentric preference for higher urban levels leads to this increase. This universal finding indicates that home-based preferences distort the hierarchical scales of human mobility in the urban environment, regardless of demographics or geography.</description>

      <title>Controlling noisy herds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wisdom of the crowd breaks down in small groups. While large flocks exhibit swarm intelligence to evade predators, small groups display erratic behavior, oscillating between unity and discord. We investigate these dynamics using small groups of sheep controlled by shepherd dogs in century-old sheepdog trials, proposing a two-parameter stochastic dynamic framework. Our model employs pressure (stimulus intensity) and lightness (response isotropy) to simulate herding and shedding behaviors. Light sheep rapidly achieve a stable herding state, while heavy sheep exhibit intermittent herding and orthogonal alignment to the dog. High response isotropy enhances group cohesion but complicates group splitting. We construct a unified phase diagram for sheep behavior, identifying three regimes (fleeing, flocking, and grazing) based on group size and stimulus specificity. Increasing stimulus specificity shifts small group behavior from grazing to fleeing, while larger groups exhibit flocking. This transition underscores the challenge of controlling small indecisive collectives. Introducing the Indecisive Collective Algorithm (ICA), we show that deliberate indecisiveness and stochasticity improve control efficiency. ICA outperforms traditional averaging-based algorithms in high-noise settings and excels in tasks requiring group splitting. Our study offers a foundational framework for controlling small, indecisive groups, applicable to biochemical reactions, cell populations, and opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>PANDORA: Deep graph learning based COVID-19 infection risk level forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COVID-19 as a global pandemic causes a massive disruption to social stability that threatens human life and the economy. Policymakers and all elements of society must deliver measurable actions based on the pandemic's severity to minimize the detrimental impact of COVID-19. A proper forecasting system is arguably important to provide an early signal of the risk of COVID-19 infection so that the authorities are ready to protect the people from the worst. However, making a good forecasting model for infection risks in different cities or regions is not an easy task, because it has a lot of influential factors that are difficult to be identified manually. To address the current limitations, we propose a deep graph learning model, called PANDORA, to predict the infection risks of COVID-19, by considering all essential factors and integrating them into a geographical network. The framework uses geographical position relations and transportation frequency as higher-order structural properties formulated by higher-order network structures (i.e., network motifs). Moreover, four significant node attributes (i.e., multiple features of a particular area, including climate, medical condition, economy, and human mobility) are also considered. We propose three different aggregators to better aggregate node attributes and structural features, namely, Hadamard, Summation, and Connection. Experimental results over real data show that PANDORA outperforms the baseline method with higher accuracy and faster convergence speed, no matter which aggregator is chosen. We believe that PANDORA using deep graph learning provides a promising approach to get superior performance in infection risk level forecasting and help humans battle the COVID-19 crisis.</description>

      <title>Proximity Matters: Analyzing the Role of Geographical Proximity in Shaping AI Research Collaborations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of geographical proximity in facilitating inter-regional or inter-organizational collaborations has been studied thoroughly in recent years. However, the effect of geographical proximity on forming scientific collaborations at the individual level still needs to be addressed. Using publication data in the field of artificial intelligence from 2001 to 2019, in this work, the effect of geographical proximity on the likelihood of forming future scientific collaborations among researchers is studied. In addition, the interaction between geographical and network proximities is examined to see whether network proximity can substitute geographical proximity in encouraging long-distance scientific collaborations. Employing conventional and machine learning techniques, our results suggest that geographical distance impedes scientific collaboration at the individual level despite the tremendous improvements in transportation and communication technologies during recent decades. Moreover, our findings show that the effect of network proximity on the likelihood of scientific collaboration increases with geographical distance, implying that network proximity can act as a substitute for geographical proximity.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for a SIR model with limited hospitalised patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyses the optimal control of infectious disease propagation using a classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model characterised by permanent immunity and the absence of available vaccines. The control is performed over a time-dependent mean reproduction number, in order to minimise the cumulative number of ever-infected individuals (recovered), under different constraints. We consider constraints on isolation measures ranging from partial lockdown to non-intervention, as well as the social and economic costs associated with such isolation, and the capacity limitations of intensive care units that limits the number of infected individuals to a maximum allowed value. We rigorously derive an optimal quarantine strategy based on necessary optimality conditions. The obtained optimal strategy is of a boundary-bang type, comprising three phases: an initial phase with no intervention, a second phase maintaining the infected population at its maximum possible value, and a final phase of partial lockdown applied over a single interval. The optimal policy is further refined by optimising the transition times between these phases. We show that these results are in excellent agreement with the numerical solution of the problem.</description>

      <title>The green hydrogen ambition and implementation gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Green hydrogen is critical for decarbonising hard-to-electrify sectors, but faces high costs and investment risks. Here we define and quantify the green hydrogen ambition and implementation gap, showing that meeting hydrogen expectations will remain challenging despite surging announcements of projects and subsidies. Tracking 137 projects over three years, we identify a wide 2022 implementation gap with only 2% of global capacity announcements finished on schedule. In contrast, the 2030 ambition gap towards 1.5{\deg}C scenarios is gradually closing as the announced project pipeline has nearly tripled to 441 GW within three years. However, we estimate that, without carbon pricing, realising all these projects would require global subsidies of \$1.6 trillion (\$1.2 - 2.6 trillion range), far exceeding announced subsidies. Given past and future implementation gaps, policymakers must prepare for prolonged green hydrogen scarcity. Policy support needs to secure hydrogen investments, but should focus on applications where hydrogen is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Local Balance in Signed Networks and Its Applications to Global International Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alliances and conflicts represent important features of complex systems like international relations. Such relations create a time-evolving signed network, where each node contributes in a unique manner to the global balance of the system. Therefore, a local index mathematically quantifying such a property becomes valuable. In this work, we introduce a local balance index for signed networks. We analyze its mathematical foundations and unique structural properties, differentiating it from existing local vertex invariants. We also establish a novel methodology linking changes in a nation's local balance to historical events. By scrutinizing the time series of local balance for countries between 1816 and 2014, we detect and categorize major historic events based on balance fluctuations. This approach harmonizes quantitative and qualitative analyses, and combined with the theory of "balance of power" is able to build up a new mixed approach to history based on network theory.</description>

      <title>Herd Behaviour in Public Goods Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of free-riding arises when individuals benefit from a shared resource, service, or public good without contributing proportionately to its provision. This conduct often leads to a collective action problem, as individuals pursue personal gains while relying on the contributions of others. In this study, we present a Bayesian inference model to elucidate the behaviour of participants in a Public Goods Game, a conceptual framework that captures the essence of the free-riding problem. Here, individuals possess information on the distribution of group donations to the public good. Our model is grounded in the premise that individuals strive to harmonise their actions with the group's donation patterns. Our model is able to replicate behavioural patterns that resemble those observed in experiments with midsized groups (100 people), but fails to replicate those for larger scales (1000 people). Our results suggest that, in these scenarios, humans prefer imitation and convergence behaviours over profit optimisation. These insights contribute to understanding how cooperation is achieved through alignment with group behaviour.</description>

      <title>Enhancing social cohesion with cooperative bots in societies of greedy, mobile individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing collective issues in social development requires a high level of social cohesion, characterized by cooperation and close social connections. However, social cohesion is challenged by selfish, greedy individuals. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the dynamics of human-machine hybrid interactions introduce new complexities in fostering social cohesion. This study explores the impact of simple bots on social cohesion from the perspective of human-machine hybrid populations within network. By investigating collective self-organizing movement during migration, results indicate that cooperative bots can promote cooperation, facilitate individual aggregation, and thereby enhance social cohesion. The random exploration movement of bots can break the frozen state of greedy population, help to separate defectors in cooperative clusters, and promote the establishment of cooperative clusters. However, the presence of defective bots can weaken social cohesion, underscoring the importance of carefully designing bot behavior. Our research reveals the potential of bots in guiding social self-organization and provides insights for enhancing social cohesion in the era of human-machine interaction within social networks.</description>

      <title>Social norm dynamics in a behavioral epidemic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the social determinants that influence the adoption of preventive measures during a disease outbreak is crucial for building effective epidemic models and hence for policy making. While traditional behavioral epidemic models focused on rational decision-making, psychological biases and the incorporation of simple imitation-based mechanisms to account for social influence, recent experimental studies highlight the necessity of considering the role of social norm dynamics. Here, we develop a behavioral epidemic model on a multilayer network, by integrating an Experience Weighted Attractor (EWA) learning mechanism with the dynamics of social norms. The resulting decision making process, can potentially lead to a boost in vaccination coverage and hence to a significantly reduced final infected fraction, offering an alternative social mechanism to altruism that can achieve this. Furthermore, we examine the importance of the dynamics of each one of the social norms' types, injunctive or descriptive, in reducing the infected fraction, finding that the former have a more significant effect. We also explore the effect that external interventions on the dynamics of social norms can have on the expansion of an epidemic, aiming in identifying improved public communication protocols. Enhanced models of social norm dynamics, if validated and tested, can better capture the complexities of human social behavior and mitigate various societal challenges beyond pandemics.</description>
