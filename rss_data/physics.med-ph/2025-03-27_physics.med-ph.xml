      <title>A dynamic reconstruction and motion estimation framework for cardiorespiratory motion-resolved real-time volumetric MR imaging (DREME-MR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a 3D pre-treatment magnetic resonance (MR) scan, we developed DREME-MR to jointly reconstruct the reference patient anatomy and a data-driven, patient-specific cardiorespiratory motion model. Via a motion encoder simultaneously learned during the reconstruction, DREME-MR further enables real-time volumetric MR imaging and cardiorespiratory motion tracking with minimal intra treatment k-space data. From a 3D radial-spoke-based pre-treatment MR scan, DREME-MR uses spatiotemporal implicit-neural-representation (INR) to reconstruct pre-treatment dynamic volumetric MR images (learning task 1). The INR-based reconstruction takes a joint image reconstruction and deformable registration approach, yielding a reference anatomy and a corresponding cardiorespiratory motion model. The motion model adopts a low-rank, multi-resolution representation to decompose motion fields as products of motion coefficients and motion basis components (MBCs). Via a progressive, frequency-guided strategy, DREME-MR decouples cardiac MBCs from respiratory MBCs to resolve the two distinct motion modes. Simultaneously with the pre-treatment dynamic MRI reconstruction, DREME-MR also trains an INR-based motion encoder to infer cardiorespiratory motion coefficients directly from the raw k-space data (learning task 2), allowing real-time, intra-treatment volumetric MR imaging and motion tracking with minimal k-space data (20-30 spokes) acquired after the pre-treatment MRI scan. Evaluated using data from a digital phantom (XCAT) and a human scan, DREME-MR solves real-time 3D cardiorespiratory motion with a latency of &lt; 165 ms (= 150-ms data acquisition + 15-ms inference time), fulfilling the temporal constraint of real-time imaging.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic thermal management in X-ray tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In X-ray tubes, more than 99% of the kilowatts of power supplied to generate X-rays via bremsstrahlung are lost in the form of heat generation in the anode. Therefore, thermal management is a critical barrier to the development of more powerful X-ray tubes with higher brightness and spatial coherence, which are needed to translate imaging modalities such as phase-contrast imaging to the clinic. In rotating anode X-ray tubes, the most common design, thermal radiation is a bottleneck that prevents efficient cooling of the anode$\unicode{x2014}$the hottest part of the device by far. We predict that nanophotonically patterning the anode of an X-ray tube enhances heat dissipation via thermal radiation, enabling it to operate at higher powers without increasing in temperature. The focal spot size, which is related to the spatial coherence of generated X-rays, can also be made smaller at a constant temperature. A major advantage of our "nanophotonic thermal management" approach is that in principle, it allows for complete control over the spectrum and direction of thermal radiation, which can lead to optimal thermal routing and improved performance.</description>

      <title>In vivo dynamic optical coherence tomography of human skin with hardware- and software-based motion correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vivo application of dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) is hindered by bulk motion of the sample. We demonstrate DOCT imaging of \invivo human skin by adopting a sample-fixation attachment to suppress bulk motion and a subsequent software motion correction to further reduce the effect of sample motion. The performance of the motion-correction method was assessed by DOCT image observation, statistical analysis of the mean DOCT values, and subjective image grading. Both the mean DOCT value analysis and subjective grading showed statistically significant improvement of the DOCT image quality. In addition, a previously unobserved high DOCT layer was identified though image observation, which may represent the stratum basale with high keratinocyte proliferation.</description>

      <title>A universal bioluminescence tomography system for pre-clinical image-guided radiotherapy research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CBCT-guided small animal irradiators encounter challenges in localizing soft-tissue targets due to low imaging contrast. Bioluminescence tomography (BLT) offers a promising solution, but they have largely remained in laboratorial development, limiting accessibility for researchers. In this work, we develop a universal, commercial-graded BLT-guided system (MuriGlo) designed to seamlessly integrate with commercial irradiators and empower researchers for translational studies. We demonstrate its capabilities in supporting in vitro and in vivo studies. The MuriGlo comprises detachable mouse bed, thermostatic control, mirrors, filters, and CCD, enabling multi-projection and multi-spectral imaging. We evaluate that the thermostatic control effectively sustains animal temperature at 37{\deg}C throughout imaging, and quantify that the system can detect as few as 61 GL261-AkaLuc cells in vitro. To illustrate how the MuriGlo can be utilized for in vivo image-guided research, we present 3 strategies, BLT-guided 5-arc, 2-field box, and BLI-guided single-beam, ranging from complicated high-conformal to simplest high-throughput plans. The high conformal BLT-guided 5-arc plan fully covers the gross tumor volume (GTV) at prescribed dose with minimal normal tissue exposure (3.9%), while the simplified, high-throughput BLT-guided 2-field box achieves 100% GTV coverage but results in higher normal tissue exposure (13.1%). Moreover, we demonstrate that the localization accuracy of MuriGlo for both widely-used SARRP and SmART irradiators is within1 mm, and the tumor coverage reaches over 97% with 0.75mm margin. The universal BLT-guided system offers seamless integration with commercial irradiators, achieving comparable localization accuracy, expected to supporting high-precision radiation research.</description>

      <title>Concrete and Lead Shielding Requirements for PET Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate shielding thickness requirements in concrete and lead walls for positron emission tomography (PET) facilities. F\textsuperscript{18}, the most commonly used PET radiotracer, emits two back-to-back 511 keV photons, necessitating effective shielding to protect hospital staff while patients are in treatment rooms and during their hospital stay. Photon transmission measurements were conducted through a standard Israeli B30 concrete wall (3 m high, 20 cm thick) using photons from an F\textsuperscript{18} source. A narrow-beam transmission coefficient of \( T = (3.0 \pm 1.0)\% \) was recorded with the source positioned 0.05 m from the wall, and the detector at distances of 0.05--3.0 m on the opposite side. When the source is 3 meters from the wall, photons within a 0.64 m radius circular disk (wide-beam) strike the wall. This produces a dose ``buildup'' effect, whereby photons striking within the disk reach the dosimeter after Compton scattering within the wall. The wide-beam transmission coefficient was measured as \( T = (8.8 \pm 1.8)\% \), corresponding to a buildup factor \( B = 4.0 \pm 0.8 \), consistent with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations \( B = 3.9 \pm 0.6 \), validating the simulation reliability for this specific setup. Note however that reliance solely on thick concrete walls presents construction challenges due to weight, space, and cost inefficiency. Since ordinary concrete effectively interacts only through Compton scattering, while lead walls interact via the photoelectric effect, lead is preferable for shielding. A 3.3 cm lead wall results in \( &lt; 0.5\% \) transmission, and lead sheets can be supported by a 5 cm gypsum wall, optimizing shielding design. However, considering the environmental toxicity of lead, note that recent studies advocate the use of tungsten carbide.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for in vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. We propose to use the \textit{a priori} knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC \textit{in vivo} in 5 mouse brains. We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\mu$m to 18.3 $\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction.</description>
