      <title>Dynamical phase transitions in postictal generalized EEG suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) is a neurological condition that occurs in patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It is marked by suppressed signals just after the seizure before the brain gradually recovers. Recovery from PGES involves a mixed state of amplitude suppression and high-amplitude oscillations, exhibiting a bimodal exponential distribution in power, unlike the unimodal exponential distribution of PGES. In this study, using the subcritical Hopf model, we explain the nature of phase transitions that underlie PGES. Our results reveal that recovery from PGES involves a change from a fixed point state to a bistable state (mixed phase), effectively captured by the noisy fixed-point and bistable regimes of the model. Consistent patterns across patients suggest a universal dynamical signature in PGES recovery. Our findings offer a mechanistic understanding of seizure termination and postictal brain state transitions.</description>

      <title>How spatial patterns can lead to less resilient ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several theoretical models predict that spatial patterning increases ecosystem resilience. However, these predictions rely on strong simplifying assumptions, such as isotropic and infinite ecosystems, and we lack empirical evidence directly linking spatial patterning to enhanced resilience. We introduce a unifying framework, encompassing existing models for vegetation pattern formation in water-stressed ecosystems, that relaxes these assumptions. This framework incorporates finite vegetated areas surrounded by desert and anisotropic environmental conditions that induce non-reciprocal plant interactions. Under these more realistic conditions, we identify a novel desertification mechanism, known as convective instability in physics but largely overlooked in ecology. These instabilities form when non-reciprocal interactions destabilize the vegetation-desert interface and can trigger desertification fronts even under stress levels where isotropic models predict stability. Importantly, ecosystems with periodic vegetation patterns are more vulnerable to convective instabilities than those with homogeneous vegetation, suggesting that spatial patterning may reduce, rather than enhance, resilience. These findings challenge the view of self-organized patterns as indicators of resilience and provide a new framework to investigate how spatial dynamics determine the stability and resilience of ecological systems across scales.</description>

      <title>Modeling the time evolution of a camphor rotor perturbed by a stationary camphor source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-propelled motion resulting from the dissipation of camphor molecules on the water surface has been attracting scientific attention for more than 200 years. A generally accepted description of the phenomenon includes equations for the object motion coupled with the hydrodynamics of Marangoni flows and the time evolution of camphor surface concentration. The solution of such equations is a numerically complex problem. In recent publications, an alternative approach based on Hamiltonian including the potential term representing Marangoni interactions has been applied to simulate the time evolution of camphor rotors. Such a model represents a significant numerical simplification if compared to the standard description. Here, we comment on the applicability of Hamiltonian approach by applying it to a single camphor rotor perturbed by a camphor disk fixed on the water surface. We demonstrate that in such a case, the approach leads to the results qualitatively different from the experimental ones. Therefore, we doubt in its applicability to describe the time evolution of interacting camphor rotors. We also show that the approximation of the Marangoni forces by a potential gives more realistic results if used together with the equation of motion that includes the hydrodynamic friction. Still, a better agreement with experiments can be obtained by considering an additional equation for the time evolution of camphor surface concentration.</description>
