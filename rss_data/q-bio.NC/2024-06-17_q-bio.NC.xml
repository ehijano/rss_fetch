      <title>Implementing engrams from a machine learning perspective: XOR as a basic motif</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously presented the idea of how complex multimodal information could be represented in our brains in a compressed form, following mechanisms similar to those employed in machine learning tools, like autoencoders. In this short comment note we reflect, mainly with a didactical purpose, upon the basic question for a biological implementation: what could be the mechanism working as a loss function, and how it could be connected to a neuronal network providing the required feedback to build a simple training configuration. We present our initial ideas based on a basic motif that implements an XOR switch, using few excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Such motif is guided by a principle of homeostasis, and it implements a loss function that could provide feedback to other neuronal structures, establishing a control system. We analyse the presence of this XOR motif in the connectome of C.Elegans, and indicate the relationship with the well-known lateral inhibition motif. We then explore how to build a basic biological neuronal structure with learning capacity integrating this XOR motif. Guided by the computational analogy, we show an initial example that indicates the feasibility of this approach, applied to learning binary sequences, like it is the case for simple melodies. In summary, we provide didactical examples exploring the parallelism between biological and computational learning mechanisms, identifying basic motifs and training procedures, and how an engram encoding a melody could be built using a simple recurrent network involving both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</description>

      <title>Suppressing seizure via optimal electrical stimulation to the hub of epileptic brain network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical stimulation to the seizure onset zone (SOZ) serves as an efficient approach to seizure suppression. Recently, seizure dynamics have gained widespread attendance in its network propagation mechanisms. Compared with the direct stimulation to SOZ, other brain network-level approaches that can effectively suppress epileptic seizures remain under-explored. In this study, we introduce a platform equipped with a system identification module and a control strategy module, to validate the effectiveness of the hub of the epileptic brain network in suppressing seizure. The identified surrogate dynamics show high predictive performance in reconstructing neural dynamics which enables the model predictive framework to achieve accurate neural stimulation. The electrical stimulation on the hub of the epileptic brain network shows remarkable performance as the direct stimulation of SOZ in suppressing seizure dynamics. Underpinned by network control theory, our platform offers a general tool for the validation of neural stimulation.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks as a tool for epileptic seizures forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evidence indicates that intracranial EEG connectivity, as estimated from daily resting state recordings from epileptic patients, may be capable of identifying preictal states. In this study, we employed hyperbolic embedding of brain networks to capture non-trivial patterns that discriminate between connectivity networks from days with (preictal) and without (interictal) seizure. A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that representations of brain connectivity in a latent geometry space can reveal a daily and reliable signature of the upcoming seizure(s), thus providing a promising biomarker for seizure forecasting.</description>

      <title>Metacognitive particles, mental action and the sense of agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper articulates metacognition using the language of statistical physics and Bayesian mechanics. Metacognitive beliefs, defined as beliefs about beliefs, find a natural description within this formalism, which allows us to define the dynamics of 'metacognitive particles', i.e., systems possessing metacognitive beliefs. We further unpack this typology of metacognitive systems by distinguishing passive and active metacognitive particles, where active particles are endowed with the capacity for mental actions that update the parameters of other beliefs. We provide arguments for the necessity of this architecture in the emergence of a subjective sense of agency and the experience of being separate from the environment. The motivation is to pave the way towards a mathematical and physical understanding of cognition -- and higher forms thereof -- furthering the study and formalization of cognitive science in the language of mathematical physics.</description>
