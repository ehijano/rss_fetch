      <title>Configurational entropy of randomly double-folding ring polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically constrained genome-like polymers often double-fold into tree-like configurations. Here we calculate the exact number of tightly double-folded configurations available to a ring polymer in ideal conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a scheme which allows us to define a ``code'' specifying how a ring wraps a randomly branching tree and calculate the number of admissible wrapping codes via a variant of Bertrand's ballot theorem. As a validation, we demonstrate that data from Monte Carlo simulations of an elastic lattice model of non-interacting tightly double-folded rings with controlled branching activity are in excellent agreement with exact expressions for branch-node and tree size statistics that can be derived from our expression for the ring entropy.</description>

      <title>Dehydration-Driven Ion Aggregation and the Onset of Gelation in ZnCl$_2$ Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A minimal model of ionic aggregation in concentrated ZnCl$_2$ is developed, guided by molecular dynamics simulations with a machine-learned potential. It explicitly incorporates solvent-site depletion, correlated chloride binding, and allows for loops within Zn-Cl clusters. Dehydration is shown to drive ion binding through two sharp transitions set by the Zn coordination number $Z$: a crossover at $Z=2$ from isolated ions to Cl-bridged clusters, and gelation near $Z\approx 3$. The model agrees quantitatively with MD results, and the critical exponent of the cluster-size distribution matches percolation theory.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Many-Body Potentials for Charged Colloids reveal Gas-Liquid Spinodal Instabilities only in the strong-coupling regime of Primitive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past experimental observations of gas-liquid and gas-crystal coexistence in low-salinity suspensions of highly charged colloids have suggested the existence of like charge attraction. Evidence for this phenomenon was also observed in primitive-model simulations of (asymmetric) electrolytes and of low-charge nanoparticle dispersions. These results from low-valency simulations have often been extrapolated to experimental parameter regimes of high colloid valency where like-charge attraction between colloids has been reported. However, direct simulations of highly charged colloids remain computationally demanding. To circumvent slow equilibration, we employ a machine-learning (ML) framework to construct ML potentials that accurately describe the effective colloid interactions. Our ML potentials enable fast simulations of dispersions and successfully reproduce the gas-liquid and gas-solid phase separation observed in primitive-model simulations at low charge numbers. Extending the ML-based simulations to higher valencies, where primitive-model simulations become prohibitively slow, also reveals like-charge attractions and gas-liquid spinodal instabilities, however only in the regime of strongly coupled electrostatic interactions and not in the weakly coupled Poisson-Boltzmann regime of the experimental observations of colloidal like-charge attractions.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of polycatenane chains and ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-chain elasticity is of fundamental importance in polymer physics, as it underlies many of the unique properties of polymer systems. Recently, there has been interest in characterizing the elastic properties of catenanes, molecular architectures composed of linked molecular rings. To date most studies have focused on the force-extension behavior of polycatenane and catenane dimers. In this study, we employ Monte Carlo computer simulations to investigate the elastic properties of a collection of catenane chains. In addition to polycatenane, we also examine the properties of catenane ribbons constructed by connecting two or three polycatenane chains together with a variable number of side-link rings. After first characterizing the behavior of free polycatenane chains and catenane ribbons, we examine their mechanical response to both an elongational force and a torque applied to the end rings of the chain. We find that the stretching induced by the force is counterbalanced by increasing the torque, which tends to twist the chains and in so doing reduce the extension length. At low torque, the twist angle of the end rings of the chain varies linearly with torque, and the associated torsional spring constant, characterizing the resistance of the chain to twist with the applied torque, tends to increase with stretching force. Relative to polycatenane, ribbons tend to be more elongated at low force and less elongated at strong force. In addition, increasing the ribbon width dramatically increases the torsional stiffness of the chain. Finally, decreasing the degree of side-linking in ribbons tends to decrease slightly the extension length at moderate force and to increase the torsional stiffness for sufficiently large gaps.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Translational Dynamics of Molecular Probes Near the Polymer Glass Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the dramatic slowdown of dynamics near the glass transition temperature (Tg) remains a long-standing fundamental and unresolved issue in soft condensed matter. While single-molecule (SM) experiments using fluorescent probes have provided critical insight for molecular and polymeric glass formers through rotational measurements, translational dynamics remain largely unexplored in such systems at the molecular length scale. Here, we report SM translational dynamics of molecular probes in high molecular weight polystyrene at three temperatures near Tg. The probes exhibit quasi-stationary position fluctuations, non-Gaussian displacement distributions, sub-diffusive transport with anti-correlated displacements, and a characteristic translational relaxation time. The observations are quantitatively described using a microscopic framework based on the generalized Langevin equation and supported by numerical modeling for heterogeneous transport. The translational dynamics of the probes provides direct microscopic evidence of dynamic heterogeneity and suggests a pathway to more fully understand glassy dynamics in glass formers near Tg.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Aggregate Anisotropy in Sheared Suspensions of Carbon Black</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon Black is a filler frequently used in conductive suspensions or nanocomposites, in which it forms networks supporting electric conductivity. Although Carbon Black aggregates originate from a presumably isotropic aggregation process, the resulting particles are inherently anisotropic. Therefore, they can be expected to interact with shear flow, which significantly influences material properties. In this study, we investigate sheared suspensions of Carbon Black aggregates to elucidate the impact of aggregate anisotropy on the rheological properties. We aim at concentrations below and above the conductivity percolation threshold and comprehensively characterize particle behavior under flow conditions. Aggregates assembled by a diffusion-limited aggregation process are simulated with Langevin dynamics in simple shear flow. The simulations reveal a clear alignment of the aggregates' long axis with the flow direction, an increase in tumbling frequency with higher shear rates, and a shear-thinning response. This behavior closely parallels that of rod-like particles and underlines the significance of the anisotropic nature of Carbon Black aggregates. These findings will facilitate the optimization of nanocomposite precursor processing and the tailoring of Carbon Black-based conductive suspensions.</description>

      <title>Capillary Condensation in Nanogaps: Nucleation or Film Coalescence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleation and film coalescence represent two fundamentally different pathways for capillary condensation. Yet, both have so far been proposed as the processes driving the condensation in nanometric confinements, leading to a long-standing and overlooked ambiguity. Here, we delineate the dichotomy between these mechanisms and test their validity using an experimental method capable of absolute distance measurement during capillary condensation. We show that the molecular content of the capillary meniscus given by the first nucleation theorem is far smaller than what the confinement geometry and the Kelvin equation require. In contrast, the analysis based on film coalescence reproduces the experimental observations and describes the final meniscus formation as a barrierless process, while allowing for an intermediate, first-order-like film-thickening transition prior to the meniscus formation.</description>

      <title>Is the active suspension in a complex viscoelastic fluid more chaotic or more ordered?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The habitat of microorganisms is typically complex and viscoelastic. A natural question arises: Do polymers in a suspension of active swimmers enhance chaotic motion or promote orientational order? We address this issue by performing lattice Boltzmann simulations of squirmer suspensions in polymer solutions. At intermediate swimmer volume fractions, comparing to the Newtonian counterpart, polymers enhance polarization by up to a factor of 26 for neutral squirmers and 5 for pullers, thereby notably increasing orientational order. This effect arises from hydrodynamic feedback mechanism: squirmers stretch and align polymers, which in turn reinforce swimmer orientation and enhance polarization via hydrodynamic and steric interactions. The mechanism is validated by a positive correlation between polarization and a defined polymer-swimmer alignment parameter. Our findings establish a framework for understanding collective motion in complex fluids and suggest strategies for controlling active systems via polymer-mediated interactions.</description>

      <title>Phase separation kinetics of 2-TIPS at low density: Cluster growth by ballistic agglomeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the kinetics of two-temperature induced phase separation (2-TIPS) in dilute binary mixtures of active ("hot") and passive ("cold") particles using molecular dynamics simulations and a coarse-grained hydrodynamic model. Following a temperature quench, cold particles nucleate into mobile clusters that move ballistically and merge through successive coalescence events. The resulting domain growth exhibits dynamic scaling with a growth exponent of approximately 0.7, markedly faster than diffusive coarsening. We identify this regime as ballistic agglomeration of cold clusters, demonstrating a distinct nonequilibrium growth mechanism in low-density scalar active systems.</description>

      <title>Peeling-Induced Rolling and Heterogeneous Adhesion in Blistered Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blisters, delaminated regions that form in multilayered structures under compressive stresses, are observed across a wide range of length scales, from two-dimensional materials to protective coatings and laminated composites. Far from being passive defects, such interfacial features have emerged as functional motifs for three-dimensional architectures and reconfigurable surfaces. Here we reveal an unusual peel response of a blistered thin film on a soft substrate. When peeled from one end, the advancing peel front triggers reattachment at the blister edge once a critical separation is reached, initiating spontaneous rolling of the film on the substrate. This peel-to-roll transition produces a sharp drop in the measured adhesion force, which then remains constant throughout the rolling phase. Using experiments, scaling analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations, we resolve the contact morphology at the transition and identify the contact length at which rolling initiates. We show that this length arises from interactions between the two contact edges and is independent of the work of adhesion. Once rolling begins, a dynamically imposed dwell time - defined by the rolling length and peel speed - translates contact history into spatial variations in adhesion force, thereby governing the magnitude of the force drop. Together, these results point to a new pathway for generating spatially tunable, heterogeneous adhesion from otherwise homogeneous interfaces.</description>

      <title>Diversity of critical phenomena in the ordered phase of polar active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analytical linear stability analysis of the Toner-Tu model for polar active fluids in the ordered phase. Our results provide exact instability criteria and demonstrate that all generic hydrodynamic instabilities fall into two fundamental categories, distinguished by their scaling with the wavevector magnitude. By applying a general criticality condition, we show that each instability can give rise to a critical point by fine-tuning only two parameters. We identify four previously unreported critical points of the Toner-Tu model, two of which already display nonequilibrium critical behavior that extends beyond known universality classes at the linear level. We further construct explicit hydrodynamic models that realize each newly identified critical point, establishing their physical attainability and providing concrete targets for future renormalization-group analyses and microscopic model studies. Altogether, our framework offers a unified theoretical foundation and a practical roadmap for the systematic discovery of new universality classes in active matter.</description>

Abstract: We study the role of repulsive granular interactions between identical intruders as they impact a granular bed. We demonstrate experimentally that repulsion does have a measurable effect in the aspect ratio of binary craters. Furthermore, we show that the protocol followed for the preparation of the granular bed plays a crucial role in the output of table-top experiments on doublet craters.</description>

      <title>A Smoluchowski equation for a sheared suspension of frictionally interacting rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we develop constitutive equations for a dense, sheared suspension of frictionally interacting rods by applying Onsager's variational method as formulated by Doi. We treat both solid friction, of the Amontons-Coulomb form; and lubricated friction, which scales with relative tangential velocity at the contact point. Dissipation functions in terms of the rod angular velocity are derived via a mean field approach for each form of friction, and from these, a Rayleighian for dense suspensions of rigid rods under shear constructed. Derivatives of this Rayleighian with respect to rod angular velocity and velocity gradient give a Smoluchowski equation and stress tensor, respectively. We show that these are representable as perturbations to Doi's model for a sheared liquid crystal. We also suggest a form for the average number of contacts between rods as a function of volume fraction, aspect ratio, and nematic order parameter, generalizing Philipse's random contact equation for disordered packings.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical and ultrametric barriers in the energy landscape of jammed granular matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the mean-field glass theory, the (free) energy landscape of disordered systems is hierarchical and ultrametric if they belong to the full-replica-symmetry-breaking universality class. However, examining this theoretical picture in three-dimensional systems remains challenging, where the energy barriers become finite. Here, we numerically explore the energy landscape of granular models near the jamming transition using a saddle dynamics algorithm to locate both local energy minima and saddles. The multi-scale distances and energy barriers between minima are characterized by two metrics, both of which exhibit signatures of an ultrametric space. The scale-free distribution of energy barriers reveals that the landscape is hierarchical.</description>

      <title>CO2-induced Rejuvenation in Polyetherimide: a New Key to Understand the Brittle-to-Ductile Transition in Mechanical Behavior of Nanocellular Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanocellular polyetherimide exhibits significant improvements in mechanical properties like toughness and impact resistance, commonly associated with the presence of nanoporosity. However, this work demonstrates these enhancements, often measured directly after processing, cannot be fully explained solely by the cellular structure but also originate from a modification of the polymer matrix induced by the CO2-saturation process. Through a systematic study involving thermal treatments and saturation-desorption processes without foaming, it is shown that CO2 exposure, even in the absence of pore formation, induces an apparent rejuvenation of the polymer, as evidenced by a reduction in the yield stress, which persists after complete CO2 desorption and in the absence of residual gas during mechanical testing. Therefore, the observed ductile response is not associated with the presence of CO2 during deformation, but with a permanent modification of the polymer matrix induced by prior gas exposure. This structural state can be thermally reversed by activating the beta relaxation of the polymer. For nanocellular polymers, the presence of residual gas within the matrix during foaming restricts thermal relaxation and helps preserve the CO2-modified state. As a result, the mechanical response of the solid phase reflects the intrinsic properties of the saturated polymer and the architecture imposed by the cellular structure. This work demonstrates for the first time that CO2 saturation can permanently alter the mechanical state of a high-Tg amorphous polymer, providing a new framework to interpret the brittle-to-ductile transition in nanocellular PEI.</description>

      <title>Active diffusing crystals in a 2D non-equilibrium system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a 2D dynamical absorbing state model of monodisperse disks, in which rich phase behavior arises from interactions consisting solely of repulsive displacements between overlapping particles. The phase diagram reveals several unconventional features, including a disordered and static absorbing configuration, where no particles overlap, separated by a second-order phase transition to a continuously evolving active hexagonal crystal with collective ring diffusion, which in turn undergoes a first-order phase transition to an active isotropic liquid. The only driving parameter is $\epsilon$, the maximum size of the random repulsive kicks. Small $\epsilon$ facilitates self-organization into an ordered state, but large $\epsilon$ prevents this organization from occurring. This is very different from typical order-disorder transitions, where there are two competing influences, energy and entropy, that drive the transition.</description>

      <title>Phase coexistence in thermo-responsive PNIPAM hydrogels triggered by mechanical forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a temperature-responsive polymer that undergoes large volumetric deformations through a transition from a swollen to a collapsed state at the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT). Locally, these deformations stem from the coil-to-globule transition of individual chains. In this contribution, I revisit the study of Suzuki and Ishii ("Phase coexistence of neutral polymer gels under mechanical constraint"), which demonstrated that a PNIPAM rod can exhibit phase coexistence (i.e. comprise swollen and collapsed domains) near the VPTT when subjected to mechanical constraints. Specifically, that paper showed that (1) collapsed domains gradually form in a fixed swollen rod with time and (2) swollen domains can nucleate in a collapsed rod that under uniaxial extension. These behaviors originate from the local thermo-mechanical response of the chains, which transition between states in response to the applied mechanical loading. Here, I develop a statistical-mechanics based framework that captures the behavior of individual chains below and above the VPTT and propose a probabilistic model based on the local chain response that sheds light on the underlying mechanisms governing phase nucleation and growth. The model is validated through comparison with experimental data. The findings from this work suggest that in addition to the classical approaches, in which the VPTT is programmed through chemical composition and network topology, the transition can be tuned by mechanical constraints. Furthermore, the proposed framework offers a pathway to actively tailor the VPTT through the exertion of mechanical forces, enabling improved control and performance of PNIPAM hydrogels in modern applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid multiscale method for polymer melts: analysis and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the flow behaviour of dense melts of flexible and semiflexible ring polymers in the presence of walls using a hybrid multiscale approach. Specifically, we perform molecular dynamics simulations and apply the Irving-Kirkwood formula to determine an averaged stress tensor for a macroscopic model. For the latter, we choose a Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system with dynamic and no-slip boundary conditions. We present numerical simulations of the macroscopic flow that are based on a finite element method. In particular, we present detailed proofs of the solvability and the energy stability of our numerical scheme. Phase segregation under flow between flexible and semiflexible rings, as observed in the microscopic simulations, can be replicated in the macroscopic model by introducing effective attractive forces.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of pattern formation in a generalized multi-species Vicsek model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of pattern formation in active systems remains a central problem of interest. Heterogeneous flocks made up of multiple species can exhibit a remarkable diversity of collective states that cannot be obtained from single-species models. In this paper, we derive a kinetic theory for multi-species systems of self-propelled particles with (anti-)alignment interactions. We summarize the numerical results for the binary system before employing linear stability analysis on the coarse-grained system. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and particle simulations, and our kinetic theory is able to capture the correct lengthscale in the emergent coexistence phases through a Turing-Hopf instability. Extending the kinetic framework to multi-species systems with cyclic alignment interactions, we recover precisely the same emergent ordering as corresponding simulations of the microscopic model. More generally, our kinetic theory provides an extensible framework for analyzing pattern formation and collective order in multi-species active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Ferro-hydrodynamics of droplet necking filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the necking, filament thinning, and pinchoff dynamics of ferrofluid droplets within a magnetic field, via a simple and low-cost experimental method. In our studies, both the Ohnesorge number Oh and the Deborah number De are O1, a typically inaccessible regime with conventional extensional rheometers. Under magnetic forcing, the nanoparticles assemble into field aligned, chainlike structures, that generate a tunable magnetoelastic response, and markedly alter the extensional flow. Although behaving as Newtonian liquids in the absence of a magnetic field, the field induces extensional thickening, and the emergence of beads on a string BOAS structures in the ferrofluid filaments, a non-Newtonian signature. By combining controlled elongation with high speed imaging, we directly quantify the magnetic field-dependent extensional viscosity and relaxation time. Our findings underscore how magnetically induced microstructures govern filament stability and extensional dynamics in ferrofluids.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced splitting of the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition in 1T-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain on the $\rho_{xx}$ and $\rho_{yy}$ components of the resistivity tensor, and the commensurable-nearly commensurate CDW (CCDW-NCCDW) transition temperature in 1T-TaS$_2$ are studied. At room temperature, uniaxial tensile strain increases the resistivity tensor components by a comparable magnitude both parallel and perpendicular to the strain axis. In the case of biaxial strain, up to 20~K decrease in the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperature is observed. In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K. The occurrence of such a phase is associated with the transition of the CDW into the commensurate state along the tensile strain direction while maintaining nearly commensurability along the perpendicular one. The results allow to justify various models widely used in analysis of transport properties of 1T-TaS$_2$ in commensurate and nearly commensurate states.</description>

Abstract: Block-copolymer electrolytes with lamellar microstructure show promising results regarding the ion transport in experiments. Motivated by these observations we study block-copolymers consisting of a polystyrene (PS) block and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block which were assembled in a lamellar structure. The lamella was doped with various amounts of lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) until very high loadings with ratios of EO monomers to cations up to 1:1 were reached. We present insights into the structure and ion transport from extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. For high salt concentrations most cations are not coordinated by PEO but rather by TFSI and THF. More specifically, LiTFSI partially separates from the PEO domain and forms a network-like structure in the middle of the lamella. This central salt-rich layer plays a decisive role to enable remarkably good cationic mobilities as well as high transport numbers in agreement with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Dielectrocapillarity for exquisite control of fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially varying electric fields are prevalent throughout nature, such as in nanoporous materials and biological membranes, and technology, e.g, patterned electrodes and van der Waals heterostructures. While uniform fields cause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply reorient the constituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a dielectrophoretic force, offering fine control of polar fluids even in the absence of free charges. Despite their vast potential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in nanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials. EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level due to the absence of a rigorous first-principles theory of electrostriction. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid state theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and capillarity. We demonstrate that dielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase transition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our findings establish "dielectrocapillarity" -- the use of EFGs to manipulate confined fluids -- as a powerful mechanism for controlling volumetric capacity in nanopores, holding immense potential for energy storage, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in neuromorphic nanofluidics. Furthermore, by linking nanoscale dielectrocapillarity to macroscopic dielectrowetting, we establish a foundation for field-controlled wetting and adsorption phenomena of polar fluids across length scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programmable assembly of nanoparticles into structures other than hexagonal lattices remains challenging. Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures.</description>

Abstract: A promising approach to transport cargo at the microscale lies within the use of self-propelled microorganisms, whose motion entrains that of passive particles. However, most applications remain limited to just a few passive particles of similar size as the microorganisms, since the transport mechanism relies on the interaction between individual swimmers and single particles. Here, we demonstrate how to control the collective transport of hundreds of large passive particles with phototactic microalga. Using directional light stimuli in suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we trigger bioconvection rolls capable of macroscale transport. Passive particles an order of magnitude larger than the microalgae are either attracted or repelled by the rolls depending on their density. Using experiments and simulation, we rationalize these bioconvective flows and describe how to harness them for cargo transport, with future applications in targeted drug delivery and decontamination.</description>

Abstract: Active navigation in disordered media depends on a biased random walk interacting with environmental constraints. Using E. coli chemotactic navigation in agar gels as a model system, we reveal a fundamental trade-off between diffusive exploration and chemotactic directional bias that dictates the optimal strategy for population range expansion. Counter-intuitively, evolution selects for shorter mean run times ({\tau}_f) to achieve faster chemotactic migration in denser environments. Controlled experiments reveal a non-monotonic relationship between chemotactic navigation speed and {\tau}_f, with the optimum shifting according to the density of physical traps in the gel. Single-cell analysis demonstrates that escape from these traps occurs independently of the tumbling mechanism, challenging the classical view that reorientation is essential for navigation in obstructed spaces. Based on these insights, we develop a minimal theoretical model showing that the optimal {\tau}_f emerges from an antagonistic scaling: while the diffusion coefficient increases with {\tau}_f, the chemotactic bias coefficient decreases with it. This work establishes a general principle for optimizing active transport through complex, disordered environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature gradients drive asymmetric ion distributions via thermodiffusion (the Soret effect), leading to deviations from the classical Debye--H\"uckel potential.We introduce the Eastman entropy of transfer, $\hat{S}_\pm = \alpha_\pm k_{\rm B}$ for cations and anions, respectively, where $k_{\rm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and analyze non-isothermal electric double layers in terms of the dimensionless Soret coefficients $\alpha_\pm$. Analytical solutions of the generalized Debye--H\"uckel equation show that, for $\alpha_+ = \alpha_-$, the potential is exactly described by a modified Bessel function, while the marginal case $\alpha_\pm = 1$ exhibits algebraic decay. An effective screening length, $\lambda_{\rm eff}$, characterizes the near-electrode potential and increases with temperature, resulting in weaker screening on the hot side and stronger screening on the cold side for $\alpha_\pm &gt; -1$. The differential capacitance is controlled by $\alpha_\pm$ via $\lambda_{\rm eff}$, with its minimum coinciding with the potential of zero charge (PZC) even in the presence of a temperature gradient. These findings highlight the fundamental coupling between electrostatics and thermodiffusion in non-isothermal electrolytes.</description>

Abstract: Fluid ferroelectrics, a recently discovered class of liquid crystals that exhibit switchable, long-range polar order, offer opportunities in ultrafast electro-optic technologies, responsive soft matter, and next-generation energy materials. Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research. These results demonstrate a practical, closed-loop approach to discovering synthesizable fluid ferroelectrics, marking a step toward autonomous design of functional soft materials.</description>

Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative (phase rigidity) information supercurrents, analogous to a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically and empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: Probing forces, deformations and generally speaking the mechanical properties of cells is the hallmark of mechanobiology. In the last two decades many techniques have been developed to this end that are largely based on deforming the cells and measuring the reaction force. In cells, an alternative approach has been implemented mid 2010's, based on Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) that produces a spectrum that can be interpreted as the response of the sample to an infinitesimal uniaxial compression at picosecond timescales. In all of these measurements, the response of the cell is quantified with a colloquial "stiffness" that encompasses both the contribution of load-bearing structures and volume changes, much to confusion. To clarify the interpretation of the hypersonic data obtained from BLS spectra, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and solid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus, we observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with increasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an estimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network. By comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly that BLS shift alone is mostly sensitive to water content while the additional analysis of the linewidth allows identifying the contribution of the biopolymer-based network dynamics in living cells.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a frustration parameter $\alpha$ into the Vicsek-Kuramoto systems of self-propelled particles. While the system exhibits conventional synchronized states, such as global phase synchronization and swarming, for low frustration ($\alpha &lt; \pi/2$), beyond the critical point $\alpha = \pi/2$, a Hopf-Turing bifurcation drives a transition to a resting hexagonal lattice, accompanied by spatiotemporal patterns such as vortex lattices and dual-cluster lattices with oscillatory unit-cell motions. Lattice dominance is governed by coupling strength and interaction radius, with a clear parametric boundary balancing pattern periodicity and particle dynamics. Our results demonstrate that purely orientational interactions are sufficient to form symmetric lattices, challenging the necessity of spatial forces and illuminating the mechanisms driving lattice formation in active matter systems.</description>
