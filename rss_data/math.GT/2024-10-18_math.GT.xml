      <title>A note on rational surgeries on a Hopf link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is clear that every rational surgery on a Hopf link in $3$-sphere is a lens space surgery. In this note we give an explicit computation which lens space is a resulting manifold. The main tool we use is the calculus of continued fractions. As a corollary, we recover the (well known) result on the criterion for when rational surgery on a Hopf link gives the $3$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Tangle replacements and knot Floer homology torsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the torsion order $\mathrm{Ord}(K)$ of a knot $K$ in knot Floer homology gives a lower bound on the minimum number $n$ such that an oriented $(n+1)$-tangle replacement unknots $K$. This generalizes earlier results by Alishahi and the author and by Juhasz, Miller and Zemke, that $\mathrm{Ord}(K)$ is a lower bound for both the unknotting number $u(K)$ and for $br(K)-1$, where $br(K)$ denotes the bridge index of $K$.</description>

      <title>Whitehead Doubles and Non-Orientable Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whitehead doubles provide a plethora of examples of knots that are topologically slice but not smoothly slice. We discuss the problem of the Whitehead double of the Figure 8 knot and survey commonly used techniques to obstructing sliceness. Additionally, we improve bounds in general for the non-orientable 4 genus of $t$-twisted Whitehead doubles and provide genus 1 non-orientable cobordisms to cable knots.</description>

      <title>On hidden face contributions of configuration space integrals for long embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Configuration space integrals are powerful tools for studying the homotopy type of the space of long embeddings in terms of a combinatorial object called a graph complex. It is unknown that these integrals give a cochain map due to potential obstructions called hidden faces. The purpose of this paper is to address these hidden faces by modifying configuration space integrals: we incorporate the bar complex of some dg algebra into the original graph complex, without changing its cohomology. Then, we give a cochain map from the new graph complex to the de Rham complex of the space of long embeddings modulo immersions, by combining the original configuration space integrals with Chen's iterated integrals. As the original complex, we choose quite a modified graph complex so that we can show it is quasi-isomorphic to one of the graph complexes introduced in the context of embedding calculus.</description>

      <title>Touching Loop Patterns with Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective is the design of a Cellular Automata rule that can form patterns with 'touching' loops. A loop is defined as a closed path of 1-cells in a 2D grid on a zero background and with a zero border. A path cell is connected with two of its adjacent neighbors. In touching loops a path cell is also allowed to touch another on a diagonal. A CA rule was designed that can evolve stable touching loop patterns. The rule tries to cover the 2D space by overlapping tiles. The rule uses so-called templates, 5 x 5 matching patterns which are systematically derived from the given set of 3 x 3 tiles. The rule checks the pattern being evolved against a list of templates. If the outer neighbors of a template match, then the cell's state is set to the template's center value. Noise is injected if there is no matching template, or the tiles are not properly assembled. Thereby the evolution is driven to the desired loop patterns.</description>

      <title>Friezes from surfaces and Farey triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a classification of positive integral friezes on marked bordered surfaces. The classification is similar to the Conway--Coxeter's one: positive integral friezes are in one-to-one correspondence with ideal triangulations supplied with a collection of rescaling constants assigned to punctures. For every triangulation the set of the collections of constants is finite and is completely determined by the valencies of vertices in the triangulation. In particular, it follows that the number of non-equivalent friezes on bordered surfaces is finite, and all friezes on unpunctured surfaces are unitary.</description>

      <title>Direct proof of one-hook scaling property for Alexander polynomial from Reshetikhin-Turaev formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that normalized colored Alexander polynomial (the $A \rightarrow 1$ limit of colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial) evaluated for one-hook (L-shape) representation R possesses scaling property: it is equal to the fundamental Alexander polynomial with the substitution $q \rightarrow q^{|R|}$. The proof is simple and direct use of Reshetikhin-Turaev formalism to get all required R-matrices.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type by Miyaoka (1977) and Yau (1978). Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>

      <title>On a canonical polynomial for links of elliptic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The canonical polynomial is an important output of the multivariable topological Poincar\'e series associated with a normal surface singularity. It can be considered as a multivariable polynomial generalization of the Seiberg--Witten invariant of the link. In the case of elliptic germs, another key topological invariant was considered, the elliptic sequence, which mirrors the specific structure of the elliptic germs and guides several properties of them.
  In this note we study the relationship of these two objects. First of all, we describe the structure of the exponents of the canonical polynomial and prove that they determine the elliptic sequence. For the converse problem, we consider an inductive setup of elliptic germs via natural extension of their graphs and compare the corresponding sets of exponents. This leads to the definition of a good extension which can be characterized by an inclusion type formula for the corresponding canonical polynomials. This reflects in a compatible way the `flag structure' of the elliptic sequence.</description>

      <title>Definite fillings of lens spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of determining the smallest (as measured by the second Betti number) smooth negative-definite filling of a lens space. The main result is to classify those lens spaces for which the associated negative-definite canonical plumbing is minimal. The classification takes the form of a list of 10 "forbidden" subgraphs that cannot appear in the plumbing graph if the corresponding plumbed 4-manifold is minimal. We also show that whenever the plumbing is minimal any other negative-definite filling for the given lens space has the same intersection form up to addition of diagonal summands. Consequences regarding smooth embeddings of lens spaces in 4-manifolds are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Cocycles of the space of long embeddings and BCR graphs with more than one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01573v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to construct non-trivial cocycles of the space $Emb(\mathbb{R}^j, \mathbb{R}^{n})$ of long embeddings. We construct the cocycles by integral over configuration spaces, associated with Bott-Cattaneo-Rossi graphs with more than one loop. As an application, we give explicitly a non-trivial family of trivial long embeddings for odd $n,j$ with $n-j \geq 2$ and $j \geq 3$. This family (cycle) is constructed from a chord diagram on directed lines. The non-triviality is shown by cocycle-cycle paring, described by paring between graphs and chord diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an exact triangle relating knot instanton Floer homology to the instanton homology of surgeries along the knot. To the author's knowledge, this is the first such result in instanton homology with integer coefficients and has no analogue in Heegaard Floer homology. To illustrate the latter claim, we derive as a consequence of this triangle, building on previous computations in the literature, that the Poincar\'e Homology Sphere is not an instanton $L$-space with $\mathbb{Z}/2$-coefficients.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian surplusection phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose you have a family of Lagrangian submanifolds \(L_t\) and an auxiliary Lagrangian \(K\). Suppose that \(K\) intersects some of the \(L_t\) more than the minimal number of times. Can you eliminate surplus intersection (surplusection) with all fibres by performing a Hamiltonian isotopy of \(K\)? Or will any Lagrangian isotopic to \(K\) surplusect some of the fibres? We argue that in several important situations, surplusection cannot be eliminated, and that a better understanding of surplusection phenomena (better bounds and a clearer understanding of how the surplusection is distributed in the family) would help to tackle some outstanding problems in different areas, including Oh's conjecture on the volume-minimising property of the Clifford torus and the concurrent normals conjecture in convex geometry. We pose many open questions.</description>
