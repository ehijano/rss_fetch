      <title>Ranks of Checkered Pattern Matrices with Applications to Information Embedding and Retrieving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Checkered patterns are characterized by their square structure and the use of only two distinct colors. These colors are typically represented by two types of numerical sets: {1,0} and {1,-1}. Matrices based on {1,0} may seem identical to those based on {1,-1} when forming checkered patterns because the only difference is that the numbers 0 are changed to -1. However, these two kinds of matrices are completely different in a mathematical sense because a matrix using {1,0} has a rank of 2 and a matrix using {1,-1} has a rank of 1. Knowing this difference in advance allows us to reduce the computational effort required for matrix operations such as information embedding and retrieving.</description>

      <title>The meaning of doing mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can AI solve all math? What do we actually mean by doing mathematics? How do we communicate mathematics? What is mathematics beyond problem solving?
  This essay is my attempt to answer these questions.</description>

      <title>Der Stern von Bethlehem -- Einige Theorien und Hintergruende: Von der altorientalischen Astrologie ueber Kepler zu Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many have have taken in hand to write a treatise on the Star of Bethlehem, particularly on Kepler's explanation as a stellar birth, triggered by Mars joining a great conjunction (a meeting of Jupiter and Saturn), as he observed it in October 1604. It is the aim of my short treatise to introduce, at a hopefully well digestible level, into underlying antiquity's concepts of physics, astrology, and astronomy around the time of Christ's birth and to demonstrate their essential developments up to the early modern period. In the latter, Kepler played a significant role. His contributions enabled him to calculate back to the year 7 BC with astonishing precision, locating a triple great conjunction in Pisces, which was then complemented by Mars. This is confirmed by both Babylonian tradition and modern astronomy. The following background provided may be specifically helpful for a more theologically oriented audience, also because the controversy surrounding "geocentric" and "heliocentric" world systems (Copernicus) is touched upon. And, because the overall context raises questions for theology, with which the epilogue concludes.</description>
