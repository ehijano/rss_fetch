      <title>Computer Assisted Discovery of Integrability via SILO: Sparse Identification of Lax Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the discovery of Lax integrability of Hamiltonian dynamical systems as a symbolic regression problem, which, loosely speaking, seeks to maximize the compatibility between a pair of Lax operators and the known Hamiltonian of the dynamical system. Our approach is first tested on the simple harmonic oscillator. We then move on to the Henon-Heiles system, i.e. a two-degree-of-freedom system of nonlinear oscillators. The integrability of the Henon-Heiles system is critically dependent on a set of three parameters within its Hamiltonian, a fact that we leverage to assess the robustness of our approach in detecting the integrability of this system with respect to the parameter dependence of the Hamiltonian. We then adapt our method to canonical examples of Hamiltonian partial differential equations, including the Korteweg-de Vries and cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, again testing robustness against nonintegrable perturbations of their respective Hamiltonians. In all examples, our approach reliably confirms or denies the integrability of the equations of interest. Moreover, by appropriately adjusting the loss function and applying thresholded $l^0$ regularization to enforce sparsity in the operator weights, we successfully recover accurate forms of the Lax pairs despite wide initial hypotheses on the operators. Some of the relevant Lax pairs, notably for the Henon-Heiles system and the Korteweg-deVries equation, are distinct from the ones that are typically reported in the literature. The Lax pairs that our methodology discovers warrant further mathematical and computational investigation, and we discuss extensively the opportunities for further improvement of SILO as a viable tool for interpretable exploration of integrable Hamiltonian dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Methods for exact solutions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations\</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to find closed form solutions of nonintegrable nonlinear ordinary differential equations, numerous tricks have been proposed. The goal of this short review is to recall classical, 19th-century results, completed in 2006 by Eremenko, which can be turned into algorithms, thus avoiding \textit{ad hoc} assumptions, able to provide \textit{all} (as opposed to some) solutions in a precise class. To illustrate these methods, we present some new such exact solutions, physically relevent.</description>

      <title>Algebro-geometric integration to the discrete Chen-Lee-Liu system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebro-geometric solutions for the discrete Chen-Lee-Liu (CLL) system are derived in this paper. We construct a nonlinear integrable symplectic map which is used to define discrete phase flows. Compatibility of the maps with different parameters gives rise to the discrete CLL system whose solutions (discrete potentials) can be formulated through the discrete phase flows. Baker-Akhiezer functions are introduced and their asymptotic behaviors are analyzed. Consequently, we are able to reconstruct the discrete potentials in terms of the Riemann theta functions. These results can be extended to 3-dimensional case and algebro-geometric solutions of the discrete modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation are obtained. Some solutions of genus one case are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Regularizations for shock and rarefaction waves in the perturbed solitons of the KP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of an asymptotic perturbation method, we study the initial value problem of the KP equation with initial data consisting of parts of exact line-soliton solutions of the equation. We consider a slow modulation of the soliton parameters, which is described by a dynamical system obtained by the perturbation method. The system is given by a quasi-linear system, and in particular, we show that a singular solution ({shock wave}) leads to a generation of new soliton as a result of resonant interaction of solitons. We also show that a regular solution corresponding to a rarefaction wave can be described by a parabola (we call it {parabolic}-soliton). We then perform numerical simulations of the initial value problem and show that they are in excellent agreement with the results obtained by the perturbation method.</description>

      <title>What is the symmetry group of a d-${\text{P}_{\mathrm{II}}}$ discrete Painlev\'e equation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry group of a (discrete) Painlev\'e equation provides crucial information on the properties of the equation. In this paper we argue against the commonly-held belief that the symmetry group of a given equation is solely determined by its surface type as given in the famous Sakai classification. We will dispel this misconception on a specific example of a d-${\text{P}_{\mathrm{II}}}$ equation which corresponds to a half-translation on the root lattice dual to its surface-type root lattice, but which becomes a genuine translation on a sub-lattice thereof that corresponds to its real symmetry group. The latter fact is shown in two different ways: first by a brute force calculation and second through the use of normalizer theory, which we believe to be an extremely useful tool for this purpose. We finish the paper with the analysis of a sub-case of our main example which arises in the study of gap probabilities for Freud unitary ensembles, and the symmetry group of which is even further restricted due to the appearance of a nodal curve on the surface on which the equation is regularized.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of soliton gases for the defocusing NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive Nonlinear Dispersion Relations (NDR) for the defocusing NLS (dark) soliton gas using the idea of thermodynamic limit of quasimomentum and quasienergy differentials on the underlying family of Riemann surfaces. It turns out that the obtained NDR are closely connected with the recently studied NDR for circular soliton gas for the focusing NLS. We find solutions for the kinetic equation for the defocusing NLS soliton condensate, which is defined by the endpoints of the spectral support $\G$ for the NDR.It turns out that, similarly to KdV soliton condensates (\cite{CERT}), the evolution of these endpoints is governed by the defocusing NLS-Whitham equations (\cite{Kodama}). We also study the Riemann problem for step initial data and the kurtosis of genus zero and one defNLS condensates, where we proved that the kurtosis of genus one condensate can not exceed 3/2, whereas for genus zero condensate the kurtosis is always 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at providing an exact algebro-geometric solution of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation derived from hyperelliptic curves in $4(p+q)-1$ genus. To achieve this goal, we construct the Riemann-Hilbert problems cosponsoring to the mCH equation, which can be solved exactly by the Baker-Akhiezer function. Then the precise expression of the algebro-geometric solution of the mCH equation can be obtained through reconstructed formula.</description>

      <title>Scalar products and norm of Bethe vectors in $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ invariant integrable models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute scalar products of off-shell Bethe vectors in models with $o_{2n+1}$ symmetry. The scalar products are expressed as a sum over partitions of the Bethe parameter sets, the building blocks being the so-called highest coefficients. We prove some recurrence relations and a residue theorem for these highest coefficients, and prove that they are consistent with the reduction to $gl_n$ invariant models. We also express the norm of on-shell Bethe vectors as a Gaudin determinant.</description>

      <title>On Lax representations under the gauge equivalence relation induced by the matrix gauge group action and Miura-type transformations for lattice equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore interconnections of differential-difference matrix Lax representations (MLRs), gauge transformations, and discrete Miura-type transformations (MTs), which belong to the main tools in the theory of integrable differential-difference (lattice) equations.
  For a given equation, two MLRs are said to be gauge equivalent if one of them can be obtained from the other by means of a matrix gauge transformation. Matrix gauge transformations constitute an infinite-dimensional group called the matrix gauge group, which acts naturally on the set of MLRs of a given equation. Two MLRs are gauge equivalent if and only if they belong to the same orbit of the matrix gauge group action.
  For a wide class of MLRs of evolutionary differential-difference equations with any number of components, we present results on the following questions:
  1. When and how can one simplify a given MLR by matrix gauge transformations and bring the MLR to a form suitable for constructing MTs?
  2. A MLR is called fake if it is gauge equivalent to a trivial MLR. How to determine whether a given MLR is not fake?
  This allows us to construct new integrable equations (with new MLRs) connected by new MTs to several known differential-difference equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13913v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fully discrete analog of the massive Thirring model in light-cone coordinates by constructing its Lax-pair representation. This Lax-pair representation can also be used to define a new Yang-Baxter map, so we obtain a Yang-Baxter map that admits a continuous limit. We present most of the results for the general case where the dependent variables are matrix-valued.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenstates of central spin models in which the central spin is unentangled with the environment are known as dark states. They have recently been observed in a class of integrable XX models. Here we find that dark states are present in XY models, but only for particular configurations of the central spin magnetic field. We show this via an explicit construction of the Bethe states.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</description>
