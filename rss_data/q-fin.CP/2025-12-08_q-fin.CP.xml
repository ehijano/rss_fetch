      <title>Convolution-FFT for option pricing in the Heston model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a convolution-FFT method for pricing European options under the Heston model that leverages a continuously differentiable representation of the joint characteristic function. Unlike existing Fourier-based methods that rely on branch-cut adjustments or empirically tuned damping parameters, our approach yields a stable integrand even under large frequency oscillations. Crucially, we derive fully analytical error bounds that quantify both truncation error and discretization error in terms of model parameters and grid settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide such explicit, closed-form error estimates for an FFT-based convolution method specialized to the Heston model. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical rates and illustrate robust, high-accuracy option pricing at modest computational cost.</description>

      <title>A Unified AI System For Data Quality Control and DataOps Management in Regulated Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In regulated domains such as finance, the integrity and governance of data pipelines are critical - yet existing systems treat data quality control (QC) as an isolated preprocessing step rather than a first-class system component. We present a unified AI-driven Data QC and DataOps Management framework that embeds rule-based, statistical, and AI-based QC methods into a continuous, governed layer spanning ingestion, model pipelines, and downstream applications. Our architecture integrates open-source tools with custom modules for profiling, audit logging, breach handling, configuration-driven policies, and dynamic remediation. We demonstrate deployment in a production-grade financial setup: handling streaming and tabular data across multiple asset classes and transaction streams, with configurable thresholds, cloud-native storage interfaces, and automated alerts. We show empirical gains in anomaly detection recall, reduction of manual remediation effort, and improved auditability and traceability in high-throughput data workflows. By treating QC as a system concern rather than an afterthought, our framework provides a foundation for trustworthy, scalable, and compliant AI pipelines in regulated environments.</description>

      <title>Semantic Faithfulness and Entropy Production Measures to Tame Your LLM Demons and Manage Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05156v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to a given task is a complex challenge. We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.</description>

      <title>Predicting Price Movements in High-Frequency Financial Data with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern high-frequency trading (HFT) environments are characterized by sudden price spikes that present both risk and opportunity, but conventional financial models often fail to capture the required fine temporal structure. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired framework well-suited to these challenges due to their natural ability to process discrete events and preserve millisecond-scale timing. This work investigates the application of SNNs to high-frequency price-spike forecasting, enhancing performance via robust hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization (BO). This work converts high-frequency stock data into spike trains and evaluates three architectures: an established unsupervised STDP-trained SNN, a novel SNN with explicit inhibitory competition, and a supervised backpropagation network. BO was driven by a novel objective, Penalized Spike Accuracy (PSA), designed to ensure a network's predicted price spike rate aligns with the empirical rate of price events. Simulated trading demonstrated that models optimized with PSA consistently outperformed their Spike Accuracy (SA)-tuned counterparts and baselines. Specifically, the extended SNN model with PSA achieved the highest cumulative return (76.8%) in simple backtesting, significantly surpassing the supervised alternative (42.54% return). These results validate the potential of spiking networks, when robustly tuned with task-specific objectives, for effective price spike forecasting in HFT.</description>
