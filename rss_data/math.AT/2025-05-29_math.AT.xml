      <title>Bochner-type theorems for distributional category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in the presence of a geometric condition such as non-negative Ricci curvature, the distributional category of a manifold may be used to bound invariants, such as the first Betti number and macroscopic dimension, from above. Moreover, \`a la Bochner, when the bound is an equality, special constraints are imposed on the manifold. We show that the distributional category of a space also bounds the rank of the Gottlieb group, with equality imposing constraints on the fundamental group. These bounds are refined in the setting of cohomologically symplectic manifolds, enabling us to get specific computations for the distributional category and LS-category.</description>

      <title>On the Farrell--Tate $K$-theory of $\text{Out}(F_n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using L\"uck's Chern character isomorphism we obtain a general formula in terms of centralisers for the $p$-adic Farrell--Tate $K$-theory of any discrete group $G$ with a finite classifying space for proper actions. We apply this formula to $\text{Out}(F_n)$. The case $n=p+1$ turns out to be especially interesting for the following reason: Up to conjugacy there is exactly one order $p$ element in $\text{Out}(F_{p+1})$ which does not lift to an order $p$ element in $\text{Aut}(F_{p+1})$. We compute the rational cohomology of the centraliser of this element and as a consequence obtain a full calculation of the $p$-adic Farrell--Tate $K$-theory of $\text{Out}(F_{p+1})$ for any prime $p \geq 5$. Our arguments provide an infinite family of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ summands in $K^1(B \text{Out}(F_n)) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Q}$, with no need for computer calculations: the first such summand is in $K^1(B \text{Out}(F_{12})) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Free Circle Actions on the Product of Three Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbit spaces of free S^0-actions on the mod 2 cohomology product of three spheres, S^n x S^m x S^l, 1 &lt;= n &lt;= m &lt;= l have been determined in [6]. In this paper, we extend these findings to free S^1-actions on the rational cohomology product of three spheres. This extension also builds upon the work of Dotzel et al. [7], who studied free circle actions on the rational cohomology product of two spheres. Additionally, we establish Borsuk-Ulam type theorems.</description>

      <title>Simplicial properadic homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we settle the homotopy properties of the infinity-morphisms of homotopy (bial)-gebras over properads, i.e. algebraic structures made up of operations with several inputs and outputs. We start by providing the literature with characterizations for the various types of infinity-morphisms, the most seminal one being the equivalence between infinity-quasi-isomorphisms and zig-zags of quasi-isomorphisms which plays a key role in the study the formality property. We establish a simplicial enrichment for the categories of gebras over some cofibrant properads together with their infinity-morphisms, whose homotopy category provides us with the localisation with respect to infinity-quasi-isomorphisms. These results extend to the properadic level known properties for operads, but the lack of the rectification procedure in this setting forces us to use different methods.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of the Klein-Williams Invariant and Universality Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the Klein-Williams invariant $\ell_G(f)$ from \cite{KW2} and the generalized equivariant Lefschetz invariant $\lambda_G(f)$ from \cite{weber07} serve as complete obstructions to the fixed point problem in the equivariant setting. The latter is functorial in the sense of Definition \ref{functorial}. The first part of this paper aims to demonstrate that $\ell_G(f)$ is also functorial. The second part summarizes the ``universality" theory of such functorial invariants, developed in \cites{lueck1999, Weber06}, and explicitly computes the group in which the universal invariant lies, under a certain hypothesis. The final part explores the relationship between $\ell_G(f)$ and $\lambda_G(f)$, and presents examples to compare $\ell_G(f)$, $\lambda_G(f)$, and the universal invariant.</description>

      <title>On the categorification of homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We categorify the concept of homology theories, which we term categorical homology theories. More precisely, we extend the notion of homology theory from homotopy theory to the realm of $(\infty,\infty)$-categories and show that several desirable features remain: we prove that categorical homology theories are homological in a precise categorified sense, satisfy a categorified Whitehead theorem and are classified by a higher categorical analogue of spectra. To study categorical homology theories we categorify stable homotopy theory and the concept of stable $(\infty,1)$-category. As guiding example of a categorical homology theory we study the categorification of homology, the categorical homology theory whose coefficients are the commutative monoid of natural numbers, which we term categorical homology. We prove that categorical homology admits a description analogous to singular homology that replaces the singular complex of a space by the nerve of an $(\infty,\infty)$-category. We show a categorified version of the Dold-Thom theorem and Hurewicz theorem, compute categorical homology of the globes, the walking higher cells, and prove that categorical $R$-homology with coeffients in a rig $R$ multiplicatively lifts to the higher category of $(R,R)$-bimodules.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood.
  Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum-observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces.
  Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Homotopical Observables and the Langlands Program via $\infty$-Topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a pro-\'etale geometric object $D_\infty$ arising naturally from the tower of Artin-Schreier extensions in characteristic 2, equipped with a canonical endofunctor $O$ whose fixed points correspond to automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{F}_2})$. The main theorem establishes that invariant predicates on $D_\infty$ parametrize cuspidal automorphic representations, preserving $L$-functions. We provide complete proofs using $\infty$-categorical techniques, explicit computations for small cases, and establish connections to discrete conformal field theory. As applications, we resolve the Carlitz-Drinfeld uniformization conjecture for function fields and compute previously unknown motivic cohomology groups. Our approach differs fundamentally from coalgebraic models by working internally in topoi and connecting to arithmetic geometry.</description>

      <title>Multiple Cylinder of Relations for Finite Spaces and Nerve Theorem for Strong-Good Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the concept of multiple cylinder of relations which is a generalization of the relation cylinder, extending the multiple non-Hausdorff mapping cylinder to sequences of finite T0-spaces linked by a series of relations. This construction is important in capturing complex homotopical structures across chains of finite spaces and, when the relations are induced by maps, it serves as a third space that collapses to two distinct finite spaces. Additionally, we introduce the concept of a strong-good cover for simplicial complexes and finite spaces, char acterized by collapsible (rather than merely contractible) intersections. This leads to a strengthened version of the Nerve Theorem, which we develop for simplicial complexes as well as for finite spaces with strong-good covers, demonstrating that these complexes and spaces and their associated nerves maintain the same simple homotopy type, thereby refining classical results for finite simplicial complexes and finite topological structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13227v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for certain pushouts of topological spaces in the category of Cech's closure spaces to agree with their pushout in the category of topological spaces. We prove that in these two categories, the constructions of cell complexes by a finite sequence of closed cell attachments, which attach arbitrarily many cells at a time, agree. Likewise, the constructions of CW complexes relative to a compactly generated weak Hausdorff space that attach only finitely many cells, also agree. On the other hand, we give examples showing that the constructions of finite-dimensional CW complexes, CW complexes of finite type, and relative CW complexes that attach only finitely many cells, need not agree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local-triviality dimensions of actions on $C^*$-algebras, which are invariants developed for noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory. While finiteness of the local-triviality dimensions is known to guarantee freeness of an action, we show that free actions need not have finite weak local-triviality dimension. Moreover, the local-triviality dimensions of a continuous field may be greater than those of its individual fibers, and the dimensions may fail to vary continuously across the fibers. However, in certain circumstances upper semicontinuity of the weak local-triviality dimension is guaranteed. We examine these results and counterexamples with a focus on noncommutative tori and noncommutative spheres, both in terms of computation and theory.</description>

      <title>Diss-l-ECT: Dissecting Graph Data with Local Euler Characteristic Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently-computable geometrical-topological invariant that characterizes the global shape of data. In this paper, we introduce the Local Euler Characteristic Transform ($\ell$-ECT), a novel extension of the ECT particularly designed to enhance expressivity and interpretability in graph representation learning. Unlike traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which may lose critical local details through aggregation, the $\ell$-ECT provides a lossless representation of local neighborhoods. This approach addresses key limitations in GNNs by preserving nuanced local structures while maintaining global interpretability. Moreover, we construct a rotation-invariant metric based on $\ell$-ECTs for spatial alignment of data spaces. Our method exhibits superior performance compared to standard GNNs on a variety of node-classification tasks, while also offering theoretical guarantees that demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Lie-operads and operadic modules from poset cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As observed by Joyal, the cohomology groups of the partition posets are naturally identified with the components of the operad encoding Lie algebras. This connection was explained in terms of operadic Koszul duality by Fresse, and later generalized by Vallette to the setting of decorated partitions. In this article, we set up and study a general formalism which produces a priori operadic structures (operads and operadic modules) on the cohomology of families of posets equipped with some natural recursive structure, that we call "operadic poset species". This framework goes beyond decorated partitions and operadic Koszul duality, and contains the metabelian Lie operad and Kontsevich's operad of trees as two simple instances. In forthcoming work, we will apply our results to the hypertree posets and their connections to post-Lie and pre-Lie algebras.</description>
