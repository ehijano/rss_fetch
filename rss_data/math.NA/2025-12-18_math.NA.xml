      <title>Accuracy of the Yee FDTD Scheme for Normal Incidence of Plane Waves on Dielectric and Magnetic Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the accuracy of the standard Yee finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme for simulating normal incidence of harmonic plane waves on planar interfaces between lossless, linear, homogeneous, isotropic media. We consider two common FDTD interface models based on different staggered-grid placements of material parameters. For each, we derive discrete analogs of the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients by formulating effective boundary conditions that emerge from the Yee update equations. A key insight is that the staggered grid implicitly spreads the material discontinuity over a transition layer of one spatial step, leading to systematic deviations from exact theory. We quantify these errors via a transition-layer model and provide (i) qualitative criteria predicting the direction and nature of deviations, and (ii) rigorous error estimates for both weak and strong impedance contrasts. Finally, we examine the role of the Courant number in modulating these errors, revealing conditions under which numerical dispersion and interface discretization jointly influence accuracy.</description>

      <title>Extending the explicit constraint force method to inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the explicit constraint force method (ECFM) was introduced as a principled approach to solution reconstruction in the presence of missing physics. In solution reconstruction, parameters of a physical model are estimated from sparse measurement data as a means to obtain the full solution field. In contrast, inverse problems target the missing parameters and estimate the solution along the way. Noting the similarity of the mathematical formulations of these two tasks, we investigate the use of ECFM to solve inverse problems. First, we compare the ECFM formulation of the inverse problem to a standard approach using two numerical examples. The first example provides an extension of ECFM to dynamic problems, and the second offers a novel approach to treat noisy measurement data. Next, we introduce a method to solve inverse problems for which the parameterized model has stochastic components. This approach is based on constraint forces and the polynomial chaos expansion, and is illustrated with another numerical example. Finally, we discuss extensions of ECFM to recover missing boundary conditions and domain geometries from measurement data, which are shown to be special cases of problems treated previously in the literature. The purpose of this work is to extend the mathematical framework of ECFM to novel applications and to gauge the method's viability as an alternative strategy for inverse analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimization of gridding algorithms for FFT by vector optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is widely used in applications such as MRI, CT, and interferometry; however, because of its dependence on uniformly sampled data, it requires the use of gridding techniques for practical implementation. The performance of these algorithms strongly depends on the choice of the gridding kernel, with the first prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF) regarded as optimal. This work redefines kernel optimality through the lens of vector optimization (VO), introducing a rigorous framework that characterizes optimal kernels as Pareto-efficient solutions of an error shape operator. We establish the continuity of such operator, study the existence of solutions, and propose a novel methodology to construct kernels tailored to a desired target error function. The approach is implemented numerically via interior-point optimization. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed kernels outperform both the PSWF and the state-of-the-art methods (MIRT-NUFFT) in specific regions of interest, achieving orders-of-magnitude improvements in mean absolute errors. These results confirm the potential of VO-based kernel design to provide customized accuracy profiles aligned with application-specific requirements. Future research will extend this framework to multidimensional cases and relative error minimization, with potential integration of machine learning for adaptive target error selection.</description>

      <title>Boundary condition enforcement with PINNs: a comparative study and verification on 3D geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their advent nearly a decade ago, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been studied extensively as a novel technique for solving forward and inverse problems in physics and engineering. The neural network discretization of the solution field is naturally adaptive and avoids meshing the computational domain, which can both improve the accuracy of the numerical solution and streamline implementation. However, there have been limited studies of PINNs on complex three-dimensional geometries, as the lack of mesh and the reliance on the strong form of the partial differential equation (PDE) make boundary condition (BC) enforcement challenging. Techniques to enforce BCs with PINNs have proliferated in the literature, but a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these techniques and a study of their efficacy on geometrically complex three-dimensional test problems are lacking. In this work, we i) systematically compare BC enforcement techniques for PINNs, ii) propose a general solution framework for arbitrary three-dimensional geometries, and iii) verify the methodology on three-dimensional, linear and nonlinear test problems with combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundaries. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying PDE, the geometry of the computational domain, and the nature of the BCs, while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. This work represents a step in the direction of establishing PINNs as a mature numerical method, capable of competing head-to-head with incumbents such as the finite element method.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tensor Train Approximation for Kinetic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical solution of kinetic equations is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the underlying phase space. In this paper, we develop a dynamical low-rank method based on the projector-splitting integrator in tensor-train (TT) format. The key idea is to discretize the three-dimensional velocity variable using tensor trains while treating the spatial variable as a parameter, thereby exploiting the low-rank structure of the distribution function in velocity space. In contrast to the standard step-and-truncate approach, this method updates the tensor cores through a sweeping procedure, allowing the use of relatively small TT-ranks and leading to substantial reductions in memory usage and computational cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several representative kinetic equations.</description>

      <title>Determinant-Based Error Bounds for CUR Matrix Approximation: Oversampling and Volume Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive error bounds for CUR matrix approximation using determinant-based methods that relate local projection errors to global approximation quality. For general matrices, we establish determinant identities for bordered Gramian matrices that decompose CUR approximation errors into interpretable local components. These identities connect projection errors onto submatrix column spaces directly to determinants, providing geometric insight into approximation degradation. We develop a probabilistic framework based on volume sampling that yields interpolation-type error bounds quantifying the benefits of oversampling: when $r &gt; k$ rows are selected for $k$ columns, the expected error factor transitions linearly from $(k+1)^2$ (no oversampling) to $(k+1)$ (full oversampling). Our analysis establishes that the expected squared error is bounded by this interpolation factor times the squared error of the best rank-$k$ approximation, directly connecting CUR approximation quality to the optimal low-rank approximation. The framework applies to both CUR decomposition for general matrices and the Nystr\"om method for symmetric positive semi-definite matrices, providing a unified theoretical foundation for determinant-based low-rank approximation analysis.</description>

      <title>A geometrically informed algebraic multigrid preconditioned iterative approach for solving high-order finite element systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is conventionally applied in a black-box fashion, agnostic to the underlying geometry. In this work, we propose that using geometric information -- when available -- to assist with setting up the AMG hierarchy is beneficial, especially for solving linear systems resulting from high-order finite element discretizations. High-order problems draw considerable interest to both the scientific and engineering communities, but lack efficient solvers, at least open-source codes, tailored for unstructured high-order discretizations targeting large-scale, real-world applications. For geometric multigrid, it is known that using p-coarsening before h-coarsening can provide better scalability, but setting up p-coarsening is non-trivial in AMG. We develop a geometrically informed algebraic multigrid (GIAMG) method, as well as an associated high-performance computing program, which is able to set up a grid hierarchy that includes p-coarsening at the top grids with minimal information of the geometry from the user. A major advantage of using p-coarsening with AMG -- beyond the benefits known in the context of geometric multigrid (GMG) -- is the increased sparsification of coarse grid operators. We extensively evaluate GIAMG by testing on the 3D Helmholtz and incompressible flow problems, and demonstrate mesh-independent convergence, and excellent parallel scalability. We also compare the performance of GIAMG with existing AMG packages, including Hypre and ML.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new second-order fast finite difference scheme in time for solving the Tempered Time Fractional Advection-Dispersion Equation. Under the assumption that the solution is nonsmooth at the initial time, we investigate the uniqueness, stability, and convergence of the scheme. Furthermore, we prove that the scheme achieves second-order convergence in both time and space. Finally, corresponding numerical examples are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work constructs and analyzes new efficient high-order two-derivative diagonally implicit Runge--Kutta (TDDIRK) schemes with optimized phase errors. Specifically, we present a convergence result for TDDIRK methods and investigate their optimized phase errors and linear stability analysis. Based on these, we derive new families of 2-stage fourth-order, 2-stage fifth-order, and 3-stage fifth-order TDDIRK schemes. Finally, we provide numerical experiments at both the ODE and PDE levels to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of these new schemes compared to known DIRK schemes in the literature.</description>

      <title>From flocking to jamming in collective cell dynamics: a Vicsek-like model including contact forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the present work is to propose an agent-based model that originally combines classical Vicsek-like polarity alignments and contact forces, as implemented in the framework developed by Maury and Venel in [Maury, Venel, 2011]. The description additionally incorporates velocity feedback on polarity and soft attraction-repulsion interactions. After carefully studying the well posedness of the model, we introduce a suitable discretization and perform an extensive range of numerical experiments to assess the impact of different modeling ingredients. The dynamical system is capable of recovering the order-disorder phase transition of the flock, as well as the jamming effect in high density regimes. As such, the developed framework can be seen as a promising theoretical tool that could contribute to improving the understanding of complex collective cell dynamics and emerging tissue flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the regular decomposition technique, we decompose the space $\mathbf{H}_0^s(\mathbf{curl}; \Omega)$ into the sum of a vector potential space and the gradient of a scalar space, both possessing higher regularity. Based on this new high order regular decomposition, a novel numerical method using standard high order Lagrange finite elements is designed for solving Maxwell eigenvalue problems. Specifically, the full convergence orders of the eigenpair approximations are proved for the proposed numerical method. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the proposed scheme and confirm the theoretical convergence results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper we have introduced a new class of radial basis functions that are powerful means to approximate functions by quasi-interpolation. In this article we extend the results to create new ways of approximating functions by prewavelets that are constructed from spaced spanned of the new hyperbolic radial basis functions. They consist of highly localised time-frequency decompositions that are suitable for analysis and filtering. The construction is sufficiently general to apply for large classes of other radial basis functions too - such as multiquadrics and their generalisations and thin-plate splines -, as well as, for example, polynomial splines.</description>

      <title>A moment model of shallow granular flows with variable friction laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a modelling framework for granular flows based on the shallow water moment equations on inclined planes. Under the assumption of a polynomial expansion of the velocity field, the model extends the classical shallow water equations to vertically variable velocity profiles. The friction effects, which are captured through the strain-rate tensor, are incorporated into the model in two terms, the bulk and bottom friction. We propose a modelling procedure to incorporate general friction laws into our framework and exemplify this combining the Manning, Coulomb, Savage-Hutter, and $\mu(I)$-rheology friction models in our modeling framework. Moreover, we develop a path-conservative finite volume numerical scheme based on the polynomial viscosity matrix method to properly handle the stiffness of the source terms. Numerical simulations are presented for different models of friction, including the case of wet-dry fronts.</description>

      <title>Consistent Parametric Model Order Reduction by Matrix Interpolation for Varying Underlying Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric model order reduction (pMOR) is a powerful tool for accelerating finite element (FE) simulations while maintaining parametric dependencies. For geometric parameters, pMOR by matrix interpolation is a well-suited approach because it does not require an affine representation of the parametric dependency, which is often not available for geometric parameters. However, the method requires that the underlying FE mesh has the same number of degrees of freedom and the same topology for all parameter configurations. This requirement can be difficult or even impossible to achieve for large parameter ranges or when automatic meshing is used. In this work, we propose a novel framework for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes. The key idea is to understand the sampled reduced bases as continuous displacement fields that can be represented in different discretizations. By using mesh morphing and basis interpolation, the sampled reduced bases described in varying meshes can all be represented in terms of one reference mesh. This not only allows for performing pMOR by matrix interpolation, but also enables comparing the subspaces that the reduced bases span, which is important to detect strong changes that could lead to inconsistencies in the reduced operators. For mesh morphing, two strategies, namely morphing by spring analogy with elastic hardening and radial basis function morphing, were implemented and tested. Numerical experiments on a beam-shaped plate and a plate with a hole for one- and two-dimensional parameter spaces show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy for both morphing methods and performs significantly better than two existing approaches for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes.</description>

      <title>Randomized orthogonalization and Krylov subspace methods: principles and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of randomized orthogonalization techniques that construct a well-conditioned basis whose sketch is orthonormal. Randomized orthogonalization has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing the computational and communication cost of state-of-the-art orthogonalization procedures on parallel architectures, while preserving, and in some cases improving, their numerical stability. This approach can be employed within Krylov subspace methods to mitigate the cost of orthogonalization, yielding a randomized Arnoldi relation. We review the main variants of the randomized Gram--Schmidt and Householder QR algorithms, and discuss their application to Krylov methods for the solution of large-scale linear algebra problems, such as linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, the evaluation of matrix functions, and matrix equations.</description>

      <title>Robust a posteriori error analysis of the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation with rough noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a posteriori error estimate for a fully discrete adaptive finite element approximation of the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation with rough noise. The considered model is derived from the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation with additive space-time white noise through suitable spatial regularization of the white noise. The a posteriori estimate is robust with respect to the interfacial width parameter as well as the noise regularization parameter. We propose a practical adaptive algorithm for the considered problem and perform numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Spectral Collocation Tensor-Network Approach for Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a space--time Chebyshev spectral collocation method for three-dimensional Maxwell's equations and combine it with tensor-network techniques in Tensor-Train (TT) format. Under constant material parameters, the Maxwell system is reduced to a vector wave equation for the electric field, which we discretize globally in space and time using a staggered spectral collocation scheme. The staggered polynomial spaces are designed so that the discrete curl and divergence operators preserve the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. The magnetic field is then recovered in a space--time post-processing step via a discrete version of Faraday's law. The global space--time formulation yields a large but highly structured linear system, which we approximate in low-rank TT-format directly from the operator and data, without assuming that the forcing is separable in space and time. We derive condition-number bounds for the resulting operator and prove spectral convergence estimates for both the electric and magnetic fields. Numerical experiments for three-dimensional electromagnetic test problems confirm the theoretical convergence rates and show that the TT-based solver maintains accuracy with approximately linear complexity in the number of grid points in space and time.</description>

      <title>Reduced Basis Methods for Parametric Steady-State Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative transfer equation (RTE) is a fundamental mathematical model to describe physical phenomena involving the propagation of radiation and its interactions with the host medium. Deterministic methods can produce accurate solutions without any statistical noise, yet often at a price of expensive computational costs originating from the intrinsic high dimensionality of the model. With this work, we present the first systematic investigation of projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) following the reduced basis method (RBM) framework to simulate the parametric steady-state RTE with isotropic scattering and one energy group. Four ROMs are designed, with each defining a nested family of reduced surrogate solvers of different resolution/fidelity. They are based on either a Galerkin or least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection and utilize either an $L_1$ or residual-based importance/error indicator. Two of the proposed ROMs are certified in the setting when the absorption cross section is positively bounded below uniformly. One technical focus and contribution lie in the proposed implementation strategies under the affine assumption of the parameter dependence of the model. These well-crafted broadly applicable strategies not only ensure the efficiency and accuracy of the offline training stage and the online prediction of reduced surrogate solvers, they also take into account the conditioning of the reduced systems as well as the stagnation-free residual evaluation for numerical robustness. Computational complexities are derived for both the offline training and online prediction stages of the proposed model order reduction strategies, and they are demonstrated numerically along with the accuracy and robustness of the reduced surrogate solvers. Numerically we observe four to six orders of magnitude speedup of our ROMs compared to full order models for some 2D2v examples.</description>

      <title>Material data identification in generalized continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven framework for identifying material behavior from full-field kinematics and force measurements in generalized (micromorphic) continua. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on constitutive assumptions or homogenization schemes, our method extracts generalized stress--strain data by enforcing non-classical balance laws and compatibility relations on full-field boundary value problems. Specifically, the approach infers the associated generalized stresses and constructs representative material datasets via clustering in a non-classical phase space. We show that the proposed method reliably extracts non-symmetric and higher-order local stress states, providing material data suitable for either model calibration or model-free data-driven simulations of generalized continua. These capabilities are demonstrated in validation simulations with synthetic data and in an application to mechanical metamaterials, suggesting a practical route for material characterization of microstructured solids.</description>

      <title>Time integration of quantized tensor trains using the interpolative dynamical low-rank approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized tensor trains (QTTs) are a low-rank and multiscale framework that allows for efficient approximation and manipulation of multi-dimensional, high resolution data. One area of active research is their use in numerical simulation of hyperbolic systems such as the Navier-Stokes equations and the Vlasov equations. One popular time integration scheme is the dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), in which the time integration is constrained to a low-rank manifold. However, until recently, DLRA has typically used orthogonal projectors to project the original dynamical system into a reduced space, which is only well-suited for linear systems. DLRA has also mostly been investigated in the context of non-quantized tensor trains. This work investigates interpolative DLRA schemes in which the low-rank manifold is constructed from aptly chosen interpolation points and interpolating polynomials, in the context of QTTs. Through various examples, its performance is compared to its orthogonal counterpart. This work demonstrates how interpolative DLRA is suitable for nonlinear systems and time integrators requiring nonlinear element-wise operations, such as upwind time integration schemes.</description>

      <title>Design of a specimen to train path-dependent deep learning material models from a single uniaxial test: eliciting strain diversity via automatically differentiable elastoplastic topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks accurately learn nonlinear, path-dependent material behavior. However, training them typically requires large, diverse datasets, often created via synthetic unit cell simulations. This hinders practical adoption because physical experiments on standardized specimens with simple geometries fail to generate sufficiently diverse stress-strain trajectories. Consequently, an unreasonably large number of experiments or complex multi-axial tests would be needed. This work shows that such networks can be trained from a single specimen subjected to simple uniaxial loading, by designing the specimen using a novel automatically differentiable elastoplastic topology optimization method. Our strategy diversifies the stress-strain states observed in a single test involving plastic deformation. We then employ the automatically differentiable model updating (ADiMU) method to train the neural network surrogates. This work demonstrates that topology-optimized specimens under simple loading can train large neural networks, thereby substantially reducing the experimental burden associated with data-driven material modeling.</description>

      <title>On bifurcations and traction forces on an obstacle in incompressible flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic numerical investigation of bifurcations in the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes flow past a confined circular cylinder. The results indicate that there is a qualitative correspondence between changes in the traction profiles of the steady Navier-Stokes equations and bifurcations of the long-time behavior of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations. The bifurcations include the appearance of symmetry breaking, oscillations, and multiple steady solutions. The well-known planar Sch\"afer-Turek benchmark is considered with Reynolds numbers up to 1000. For the analysis of bifurcations and traction profiles, several numerical strategies are applied, including a duality method for computing traction profiles, deflation methods, and linear stability analysis. Long-time flow behavior is often explored through direct numerical simulation of the unsteady equations; an approach that is computationally demanding. The relations presented here indicate the possibility of a computationally inexpensive strategy to detect critical Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modeling of blood circulation with cerebral autoregulation and network pathway analysis for hemodynamic redistribution in the vascular network with anatomical variations and stenosis conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cerebral hemodynamics is fundamentally regulated by the Circle of Willis (CoW), which redistributes flow through communicating arteries to stabilize perfusion under anatomical variations and vascular stenosis. In this study, we develop a multiscale circulation model by coupling a systemic hemodynamic framework with a cerebral arterial network reconstructed from medical imaging. The model incorporates a cerebral autoregulation mechanism (CAM) and enables quantitative simulation of flow redistribution within the CoW under normal, anatomically varied, and stenotic conditions. Baseline simulations reproduce physiological flow distributions in which communicating arteries remain nearly inactive, showing negligible cross-flow and agreement with clinical measurements. In contrast, anatomical variations reveal distinct collateral activation patterns: the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) emerges as the earliest and most sensitive functional collateral, whereas the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) exhibit structure-dependent engagement. Progressive stenosis simulations further demonstrate a transition from a complete CoW to a fetal-type posterior cerebral artery (PCA) configuration, characterized by early ACoA flow reversal followed by ipsilateral PCoA activation, consistent with experimental and transcranial Doppler observations. Finally, a path-based quantitative analysis is introduced to illustrate how the cerebral vascular network dynamically reconfigures collateral pathways in response to structural changes. Overall, the proposed framework provides a physiologically interpretable, image-informed tool for investigating cerebral flow regulation through functional collaterals within the CoW, with potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment planning of cerebrovascular diseases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to compute the Fourier transform of a function $f$ on the real line numerically, one samples $f$ on a grid and then takes the discrete Fourier transform. We derive exact error estimates for this procedure in terms of the decay and smoothness of $f$. The analysis provides a new recipe of how to relate the number of samples, the sampling interval, and the grid size.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Noise-Free Sampling Algorithms with Regularized Wasserstein Proximals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the convergence properties of the backward regularized Wasserstein proximal (BRWP) method for sampling a target distribution. The BRWP approach can be shown as a semi-implicit time discretization for a probability flow ODE with the score function whose density satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. Specifically, the evolution of the density, hence the score function, is approximated via a kernel representation derived from the regularized Wasserstein proximal operator. By applying the dual formulation and a localized Taylor series to obtain the asymptotic expansion of this kernel formula, we establish guaranteed convergence in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence for the BRWP method towards a strongly log-concave target distribution. Our analysis also identifies the optimal and maximum step sizes for convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the deterministic and semi-implicit BRWP scheme outperforms many classical Langevin Monte Carlo methods, such as the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA), by offering faster convergence and reduced bias. Numerical experiments further validate the convergence analysis of the BRWP method.</description>

Abstract: We present an extension of local sensitivity analysis, also referred to as the perturbation approach for uncertainty quantification, to Bayesian inverse problems. More precisely, we show how moments of random variables with respect to the posterior distribution can be approximated efficiently by asymptotic expansions. This is under the assumption that the measurement operators and prediction functions are sufficiently smooth and their corresponding stochastic moments with respect to the prior distribution exist. Numerical experiments are presented to the illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Safer Prompts: Reducing Risks from Memorization in Visual Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Generative AI models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating high-quality images from user inputs like text prompts. However, because these models have billions of parameters, they risk memorizing certain parts of the training data and reproducing the memorized content. Memorization often raises concerns about safety of such models -- usually involving intellectual property (IP) infringement risk -- and deters their large scale adoption. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques in reducing memorization risk in image generation. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt engineering in reducing the similarity between generated images and the training data of diffusion models, while maintaining relevance and aestheticity of the generated output.</description>

      <title>Hybrid CG-Tikhonov is a filtration of the CG Lanczos vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider iterative methods for solving linear ill-posed problems with compact operator and right-hand side only available via noise-polluted measurements. Conjugate gradients (CG) applied to the normal equations with an appropriate stopping rule and CG applied to the system solving for a Tikhonov-regularized solution (CGT) $(A^\ast A + c I_{\mathcal{X}}) x^{(\delta,c)} = A^\ast y^\delta$ are closely related regularization methods that build iterates from the same Krylov subspaces.
  In this work, we show that the CGT iterate can be expressed as $
x^{(\delta,c)}_m =
\sum_{i=1}^{m} \gamma^{(m)}_i(c) z_i^{(m)}v_i, $
where $\left\lbrace\gamma_i^{(m)}(c)\right\rbrace_{i=1}^m$ are functions of the Tikhonov parameter $c$ and $x^{(\delta)}_m = \sum_{i=1}^{m} z_i^{(m)}v_i$ is the $m$-th CG iterate. We call these functions Lanczos filters, and they can be shown to have decay properties as $c\rightarrow\infty$ with the speed of decay increasing with $i$. This has the effect of filtering out the contribution of the later terms of the CG iterate. The filters can be constructed using quantities defined via recursions at each iteration.
  We demonstrate with numerical experiments that good parameter choices correspond to appropriate damping of the Lanczos vectors. The filtration approach also provides a platform for further development of parameter choice rules, and similar representations may hold for other hybrid iterative schemes.</description>

Abstract: We consider a two dimensional biharmonic problem and its discretization by means of a symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method. A novel split of an error measure based on a generalized Hessian into two terms measuring the conformity and nonconformity of the scheme is proven. This splitting is the departing point for the design of a new error estimator, which is provably reliable and efficient for polynomial degree larger than~$3$, and does not involve any DG stabilization. Such an error estimator can be bounded from above by the standard DG residual error estimator. Numerical results assess the theoretical predictions, including the efficiency of the proposed estimator, for all polynomial degrees larger than or equal to~$2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a recent a posteriori error estimator for the finite element solution of the wave equation with explicit time-stepping [Grote, Lakkis, Santos, 2024], we devise a space-time adaptive strategy which includes both time evolving meshes and local time-stepping [Diaz, Grote, 2009] to overcome any overly stringent CFL stability restriction on the time-step due to local mesh refinement. Moreover, at each time-step the adaptive algorithm monitors the accuracy thanks to the error indicators and recomputes the current step on a refined mesh until the desired tolerance is met; meanwhile, the mesh is coarsened in regions of smaller errors. Leapfrog based local time-stepping is applied in all regions of local mesh refinement to incorporate adaptivity into fully explicit time integration with mesh change while retaining efficiency. Numerical results illustrate the optimal rate of convergence of the a posteriori error estimators on time evolving meshes.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing the singularity swap quadrature for near-singular line integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singularity swap quadrature (SSQ) is an effective method for the evaluation at nearby targets of potentials due to densities on curves in three dimensions. While highly accurate in most settings, it is known to suffer from catastrophic cancellation when the kernel exhibits both near-vanishing numerators and strong singularities, as arises with scalar double layer potentials or tensorial kernels in Stokes flow or linear elasticity. This precision loss turns out to be tied to the interpolation basis, namely monomial (for open curves) or Fourier (for closed curves). We introduce a simple yet powerful remedy: target-specific translated monomial and Fourier bases that explicitly incorporate the near-vanishing behavior of the kernel numerator. We combine this with a stable evaluation of the constant term which now dominates the integral, significantly reducing cancellation. We show that our approach achieves close to machine precision for prototype integrals, and up to ten orders of magnitude lower error than standard SSQ at extremely close evaluation distances, without significant additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>Numerical and analytical modeling of heat equation in current-carrying conductors using the heat equation implemented using Finite-JAX</title>

Abstract: Current-carrying conductors inevitably experience resistive heating due to the material's finite electrical conductivity. The resulting temperature distribution within the wire has essential implications for structural integrity, efficiency, and long-term reliability of electronic and power systems. In this work, we model the steady-state heat distribution in a current-carrying wire using the classical heat conduction equation. In a two-dimensional formulation, heat transport is considered both along and across the conductor. The governing partial differential equation is discretized using finite-difference methods implemented in Finite-JAX, with appropriate initial and boundary conditions, including the Dirichlet condition relevant to practical scenarios. Time integration is performed using the Euler explicit scheme, and stability constraints are systematically examined. To assess the accuracy of the numerical approach, we compare the computed temperature fields with the exact analytical solution of the heat equation for canonical geometry. Results show that the numerical prediction converges toward the analytical solution, with error norms decreasing at the expected order of accuracy. This study demonstrates how the heat equation provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for modeling resistive heating in conductors. The errors between the numerical and analytical solutions are 1.981 K, 0.8975 K, and 0.7917 K, corresponding to the L-infinity, L1, and L2 norms. For tensor computations, TPUs deliver the highest performance, surpassing GPUs and CPUs.</description>

      <title>Data-intrinsic approximation in metric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis and processing of data is a vital part of our modern society and requires vast amounts of computational resources. To reduce the computational burden, compressing and approximating data has become a central topic. We consider the approximation of labeled data samples, mathematically described as site-to-value maps between finite metric spaces. Within this setting, we identify the discrete modulus of continuity as an effective data-intrinsic quantity to measure regularity of site-to-value maps without imposing further structural assumptions. We investigate the consistency of the discrete modulus of continuity in the infinite data limit and propose an algorithm for its efficient computation. Building on these results, we present a sample based approximation theory for labeled data. For data subject to statistical uncertainty we consider multilevel approximation spaces and a variant of the multilevel Monte Carlo method to compute statistical quantities of interest. Our considerations connect approximation theory for labeled data in metric spaces to the covering problem for (random) balls on the one hand and the efficient evaluation of the discrete modulus of continuity to combinatorial optimization on the other hand. We provide extensive numerical studies to illustrate the feasibility of the approach and to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Neural Multiscale Decomposition for Solving The Nonlinear Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a neural multiscale decomposition method (NeuralMD) for solving the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$ from the relativistic regime to the nonrelativistic limit regime. The solution of the NKGE propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ and $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in space and time, respectively, which brings the oscillation in time. Existing collocation-based methods for solving this equation lead to spectral bias and propagation failure. To mitigate the spectral bias induced by high-frequency time oscillation, we employ a multiscale time integrator (MTI) to absorb the time oscillation into the phase. This decomposes the NKGE into a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with wave operator (NLSW) with well-prepared initial data and a remainder equation with small initial data. As $\varepsilon \to 0$, the NKGE converges to the NLSW at rate $O(\varepsilon^{2})$, and the contribution of the remainder equation becomes negligible. Furthermore, to alleviate propagation failure caused by medium-frequency time oscillation, we propose a gated gradient correlation correction strategy to enforce temporal coherence in collocation-based methods. As a result, the approximation of the remainder term is no longer affected by propagation failure. Comparative experiments with existing collocation-based methods demonstrate the superior performance of our method for solving the NKGE with various regularities of initial data over the whole regime.</description>

Abstract: We study a model for lithium (Li) electrodeposition on Li-metal electrodes that leads to dendritic pattern formation. The model comprises of a system of three coupled PDEs, taking the form of an Allen--Cahn equation, a Nernst--Planck equation and a Poisson equation. We prove existence of a weak solution and stability results for this system and present numerical simulations resulting from a finite element approximation of the system, which illustrate the dendritic nature of solutions to the model.</description>

      <title>Worth Their Weight: Randomized and Regularized Block Kaczmarz Algorithms without Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the ever growing amounts of data leveraged for machine learning and scientific computing, it is increasingly important to develop algorithms that sample only a small portion of the data at a time. In the case of linear least-squares, the randomized block Kaczmarz method (RBK) is an appealing example of such an algorithm, but its convergence is only understood under sampling distributions that require potentially prohibitively expensive preprocessing steps. To address this limitation, we analyze RBK when the data is sampled uniformly, showing that its iterates converge in a Monte Carlo sense to a $\textit{weighted}$ least-squares solution. Unfortunately, for general problems the bias of the weighted least-squares solution and the variance of the iterates can become arbitrarily large. We show that these quantities can be rigorously controlled by incorporating regularization into the RBK iterations, yielding the regularized algorithm ReBlocK. Numerical experiments including examples arising from natural gradient optimization demonstrate that ReBlocK can outperform both RBK and minibatch stochastic gradient descent for inconsistent problems with rapidly decaying singular values.</description>

      <title>Discrete stochastic maximal regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete regularity estimates for a broad class of temporal numerical schemes for parabolic stochastic evolution equations. We provide a characterization of discrete stochastic maximal $\ell^p$-regularity in terms of its continuous counterpart, thereby establishing a unified framework that yields numerous new discrete regularity results. Moreover, as a consequence of the continuous-time theory, we establish several important properties of discrete stochastic maximal regularity such as extrapolation in the exponent $p$ and with respect to a power weight. Furthermore, employing the $H^\infty$-functional calculus, we derive a powerful discrete maximal estimate in the trace space norm $D_A(1-\frac1p,p)$ for $p \in [2,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Cross-Model Verification of Wall-Bounded Flows using Finite-JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed in JAX (Finite-JAX), and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations, also known as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features, including velocity profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition, numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for the laminar regime, allowing direct quantification of the verification accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research. The performance of Finite-JAX on Wall-Bounded Flows is 0.014765 in the L2 norm.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithm with extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonconvex optimization problems are widespread in modern machine learning and data science. We introduce an extrapolation strategy into a class of preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithms for nonconvex optimization problems. The proposed algorithms combine second-order backward differentiation formulas (BDF2) with an extrapolation method. Meanwhile, the implicit-explicit scheme simplifies the subproblem through a preconditioned process. As a result, our approach solves nonconvex problems efficiently without significant computational overhead. Theoretical analysis establishes global convergence of the algorithms using Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz properties. Numerical experiments include a benchmark problem, the least squares problem with SCAD regularization, and an image segmentation problem. These results demonstrate that our algorithms are highly efficient, as they achieve reduced solution times and competitive performance.</description>
