      <title>SymTFT Fans: The Symmetry Theory of 4d N=4 Super Yang-Mills on spaces with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SymTFT construction is an efficient way of studying the symmetries of Quantum Field Theories. In this paper we initiate the study of the SymTFT construction for interacting theories on spaces with boundaries, in the concrete example of $d = 4$ $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory with Gaiotto-Witten boundary conditions. The resulting SymTFT has a number of peculiarities, most prominently a fan-like structure with a number of different SymTFT sectors joined by gapless interfaces that merge at the Gaiotto-Witten boundary SCFT.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tube Algebras, Symmetry-Resolved Partition Functions, and Twisted Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of generalized tube algebras which describe how finite, non-invertible global symmetries of bosonic 1+1d QFTs act on operators which sit at the intersection point of a collection of boundaries and interfaces. We develop a 2+1d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) picture of boundaries and interfaces which, among other things, allows us to deduce the representation theory of these algebras. In particular, we initiate the study of a character theory, echoing that of finite groups, and demonstrate how many representation-theoretic quantities can be expressed as partition functions of the SymTFT on various backgrounds, which in turn can be evaluated explicitly in terms of generalized half-linking numbers. We use this technology to explain how the torus and annulus partition functions of a 1+1d QFT can be refined with information about its symmetries. We are led to a vast generalization of Ishibashi states in CFT: to any multiplet of conformal boundary conditions which transform into each other under the action of a symmetry, we associate a collection of generalized Ishibashi states, in terms of which the twisted sector boundary states of the theory and all of its orbifolds can be obtained as linear combinations. We derive a generalized Verlinde formula involving the characters of the boundary tube algebra which ensures that our formulas for the twisted sector boundary states respect open-closed duality. Our approach does not rely on rationality or the existence of an extended chiral algebra; however, in the special case of a diagonal RCFT with chiral algebra $V$ and modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, our formalism produces explicit closed-form expressions - in terms of the $F$-symbols and $R$-matrices of $\mathscr{C}$, and the characters of $V$ - for the twisted Cardy states, and the torus and annulus partition functions decorated by Verlinde lines.</description>

      <title>Light-Ray Wave Functions and Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using integrability, we construct (to leading order in perturbation theory) the explicit form of twist-three light-ray operators in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. This construction allows us to directly compute analytically continued CFT data at complex spin. We derive analytically the "magic'' decoupling zeroes previously observed numerically. Using the Baxter equation, we also show that certain Regge trajectories merge together into a single unifying Riemann surface. Perhaps more surprisingly, we find that this unification of Regge trajectories is not unique. If we organize twist-three operators differently into what we call "cousin trajectories'' we find infinitely more possible continuations. We speculate about which of these remarkable features of twist-three operators might generalize to other operators, other regimes and other theories.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weak Gravity Conjecture holds that gravity must be the weakest force. This is true of the familiar forces in our own universe -- electromagnetism, for instance, is many orders of magnitude stronger than gravity. But the bold claim of the Weak Gravity Conjecture is that this statement is true, not only for electromagnetism in our universe, but for any similar force in any consistent universe governed by quantum mechanics. In this brief introduction, aimed at advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students, we elaborate on the precise definition of the Weak Gravity Conjecture, the evidence for it, and some of the remarkable implications of it. We explain how the Weak Gravity Conjecture may play a role in bridging the gulf between the formal mathematics of string theory and the real-world observations of particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetry Resolution of Entanglement in CFT for Twisted and Anyonic sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy (EE) in $(1+1)$-d rational conformal field theories (RCFT) with categorical non-invertible symmetries is presented. This amounts to symmetry resolving the entanglement with respect to the generalized twisted and anyonic charge sectors of the theory. The anyonic sectors label the irreducible representations of a modular fusion category defining the symmetry and can be understood through the $(2+1)$-d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) that encodes the symmetry features of the CFT. Using this, we define the corresponding generalized boundary dependent charged moments necessary for the symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy, which is the main result of this work. Furthermore, contrary to the case of invertible symmetries, we observe the breakdown of entanglement equipartition between different charged sectors at the next-to-leading order in the ultraviolet cutoff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of boundary conditions (BCs) in theories with categorical (or non-invertible) symmetries. We describe how the transformation properties, or (generalized) charges, of BCs are captured by topological BCs of Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), which is a topological field theory in one higher spacetime dimension. As an application of the SymTFT chracterization, we discuss the symmetry properties of boundary conditions for (1+1)d gapped and gapless phases. We provide a number of concrete examples in spacetime dimensions $d=2,3$. We furthermore expand the lattice description for (1+1)d anyon chains with categorical symmetries to include boundary conditions carrying arbitrary 1-charges under the symmetry.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Maze: A System With Tunable Scale Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random magnetic field configurations are ubiquitous in nature. Such fields lead to a variety of dynamical phenomena, including localization and glassy physics in some condensed matter systems and novel transport processes in astrophysical systems. Here we consider the physics of a charged quantum particle moving in a ``magnetic maze'': a high-dimensional space filled with a randomly chosen vector potential and a corresponding magnetic field. We derive a path integral description of the model by introducing appropriate collective variables and integrating out the random vector potential, and we solve for the dynamics in the limit of large dimensionality. We derive and analyze the equations of motion for Euclidean and real-time dynamics, and we calculate out-of-time-order correlators. We show that a special choice of vector potential correlations gives rise, in the low temperature limit, to a novel scale-invariant quantum theory with a tunable dynamical exponent. Moreover, we show that the theory is chaotic with a tunable chaos exponent which approaches the chaos bound at low temperature and strong coupling.</description>

      <title>The Axion is Going Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the effect of a non-Abelian dark sector gauge group that couples to the axion field. In particular, we analyze effects that arise if the dark sector gauge group mixes topologically with the Standard Model. This is achieved by gauging a subgroup of the global center 1-form symmetries which embeds non-trivially in both the visible as well as the dark sector gauge groups. Leaving the local dynamics unchanged, this effect modifies the quantization conditions for the topological couplings of the axion, which enter the estimate of a lower bound on the axion-photon coupling. In the presence of a dark sector this lower bound can be reduced significantly, which might open up interesting new parameter regions for axion physics. We further determine the allowed exotic matter representations in the presence of topological mixing with a dark sector, explore the generalized categorical symmetries of such axion theories, and comment on other model-independent phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Effect of Extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwinger effect has a variety of physics applications. In the context of black hole physics, it provides a channel for the decay of charged black holes. While the Schwinger rate has been derived for extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole using the $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry of the horizon, a full analysis in the whole geometry is lacking, begging the question of whether it is sufficient to ignore contributions away from the horizon. In this paper, we address this problem and obtain the spatial profile of the Schwinger production rate in an asymptotically flat RN black hole spacetime. We find that the Schwinger effect is strongest on the horizon and decays with distance from the horizon, exhibiting a characteristic scale of the Compton wavelength of the particle. The rate is switched off when the particle's charge-to-mass ratio approaches the corresponding extremality bound for black holes, in accordance with a strong form of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC).</description>

      <title>Gravity from Pre-geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational interaction, as described by the Einstein-Cartan theory, is shown to emerge as the by-product of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a gauge symmetry in a pre-geometric four-dimensional spacetime. Starting from a formulation \`a la Yang-Mills on an SO(1,4) or SO(3,2) principal bundle and not accounting for a spacetime metric, the Einstein-Hilbert action is recovered after the identification of the effective spacetime metric and spin connection for the residual SO(1,3) gauge symmetry of the spontaneously broken phase - i.e. the stabiliser of the SO(1,4) or SO(3,2) gauge group. Thus, the two fundamental tenets of General Relativity, i.e. diffeomorphism invariance and the equivalence principle, can arise from a more fundamental gauge principle. The two mass parameters that characterise Einstein gravity, namely the Planck mass and the cosmological constant, are likewise shown to be emergent, with the correct sign for the cosmological constant depending on whether the fundamental gauge group is taken to be either the de Sitter or the anti-de Sitter group. The phase transition from the unbroken to the spontaneously broken phase is expected to happen close to the Planck temperature. This is conjectured to be dynamically driven by a scalar field that implements a Higgs mechanism, hence providing mass to new particles, with consequences for cosmology and high-energy physics. The couplings of gravity to matter are discussed after drawing up a dictionary that interconnects pre-geometric and effective geometric quantities. In the unbroken phase where the fundamental gauge symmetry is restored, the theory is potentially power-counting renormalisable without matter, offering a novel path towards a UV completion of Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-Relativistic Holography from AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a novel holographic correspondence appears after taking a suitable stringy non-relativistic limit of the AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ duality. This correspondence relates string theory in String Newton-Cartan AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ with Galilean Electrodynamics with five scalars defined on the Penrose conformal boundary. As a first test, we match the Killing vectors on the string theory side with the on-shell symmetries of the dual field theory.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a framework for computing the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories has been proposed by Saura-Bastida, Das, Sierra and Molina-Vilaplana [Phys. Rev. D109, 105026]. We revisit their theoretical setup, paying particular attention to possible contributions from the conformal boundary conditions imposed at the entangling surface -- a potential subtlety that was not addressed in the original proposal. We find that the presence of boundaries modifies the construction of projectors onto irreducible sectors, compared to what can be expected from a pure bulk approach. This is a direct consequence of the fusion algebra of non-invertible symmetries being different in the presence or absence of boundaries on which defects can end. We apply our formalism to the case of the Fibonacci category symmetry in the three-state Potts and tricritical Ising model and the Rep($S_3$) fusion category symmetry in the $SU(2)_4$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. We numerically corroborate our findings by simulating critical anyonic chains with these symmetries as a finite lattice substitute for the expected entanglement Hamiltonian. Our predictions for the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries seem to disagree with the recent work by Saura-Bastida et al.</description>

      <title>Flavor symmetries from modular subgroups in magnetized compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the flavor structures of zero-modes, which are originated from the modular symmetry on $T^2_1\times T^2_2$ and its orbifold with magnetic fluxes. We introduce the constraint on the moduli parameters by $\tau_2=N\tau_1$, where $\tau_i$ denotes the complex structure moduli on $T^2_i$. Such a constraint can be derived from the moduli stabilization. The modular symmetry of $T^2_1 \times T^2_2$ is $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})_{\tau_1} \times SL(2,\mathbb{Z})_{\tau_2} \subset Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$ and it is broken to $\Gamma_0(N) \times \Gamma^0(N)$ by the moduli constraint. The wave functions represent their covering groups. We obtain various flavor groups in these models.</description>

      <title>Bulk Reconstruction and Gauge Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the concept of bulk reconstruction, which involves mapping bulk operators into CFT operators to understand the emergence of spacetime and gravity. We argue that the $N=\infty$ approximation fails to capture crucial aspects of gravity, as it does not respect gauge invariance and lacks direct connections between energy and boundary metrics. Key concepts such as entanglement wedge reconstruction and holographic error correction codes, which are based on the $N=\infty$ theory, may be incorrect or require significant revision when finite $N$ effects are considered. We present explicit examples demonstrating discrepancies in bulk reconstructions and suggest that a gauge-invariant approach is necessary for an accurate understanding.</description>

      <title>A Supersymmetric Suspicion From Accelerating Black Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the supermassive black holes $\textrm{Sgr A}^\star$ and $\textrm{M87}^\star$, we explore a potential supersymmetry suspicion within the observational data. Specifically, we investigate the shadow of a supersymmetric accelerating black hole and compare our findings with observed quantities such as the angular diameter $\mathcal{D}$ and the fractional deviation $\bm{\delta}$. Our analysis reveals a significant alignment between the calculated quantities and the EHT collaboration measurements. This alignment suggests that the features of the black hole shadows observed by the EHT exhibit characteristics consistent with the supersymmetry framework.
  Our results provide compelling evidence for supersymmetry from a gravitational perspective, which remains absent from the particle physics viewpoint till now.</description>

      <title>On the particle content of MHS theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moyal-Higher-Spin (MHS) formalism, involving fields dependent on spacetime and auxiliary coordinates, is an approach to studying higher spin (HS)-like models. To determine the particle content of the MHS model of the Yang-Mills type, we calculate the quartic Casimir operator for on-shell MHS fields, finding it generally non-vanishing, indicative of infinite/continuous-spin degrees of freedom. We propose an on-shell basis for these infinite/continuous-spin states. Additionally, we analyse the content of a massive MHS model.</description>

      <title>A Non-Invertible Symmetry-Resolved Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy Formula and Entanglement Entropy from the Boundary Tube Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a refined version of the Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy formula for a 1+1d conformal field theory, which controls the asymptotic density of high energy states on an interval transforming under a given representation of a non-invertible global symmetry. We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the non-invertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).</description>

      <title>Vacuum Radiation Pressure Fluctuations on Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a study of the properties and applications of quantum stress tensor fluctuations. Here we treat the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic energy-momentum flux operator which as been averaged in space and time. The probability distribution of these fluctuations depends upon the details of this averaging and may allow fluctuations very large compared to the variance. The possibility of detecting their effects on electrons will be considered. The averaging of the flux operator will arise from the interaction of an electron with a wave packet containing real photons, The vacuum radiation pressure fluctuations can exert a force on the electron in any direction, in contrast to the effect of scattering by real photons. Some numerical estimates of the effect will be given.</description>

      <title>On holographic confining QFTs on AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic quantum field theories that confine in flat space, are considered on a fixed AdS space. The space of holographic solutions for such theories is constructed and three types of regular solutions are found. Theories with two AdS boundaries provide interfaces between two confining theories. Theories with a single AdS boundary correspond to ground states of a single confining theory on AdS. We find solutions without a boundary, whose interpretation is not obvious. There is also a special limiting solution that oscillates an infinite number of times around the UV fixed point. We analyze in detail the holographic dictionary for the one-boundary solutions and compute the free energy. No (quantum) phase transitions are found when we change the curvature. We find an infinite number of pure vev solutions, but no CFT solution without a vev. We also compute the free energy of the interface solutions. We find that the product saddle points have always lower free energy than the connected solutions. This implies that in such interfaces, normalized cross-correlators vanish exponentially in $N_c^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory describing accelerating, charged, and rotating black hole, i.e. the accelerating Kaluza-Klein black hole. Some properties the spacetime are discussed, such as the electromagnetic fields, the area-temperature product, and the holography according to Kerr/CFT correspondence. As expected, the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for an extremal accelerating Kaluza-Klein black hole can be recovered by using Cardy formula of a two dimensional conformal field theory. An interesting feature is found, namely the area-temperature product is just the the one belongs to the vacuum Einstein seed solution.</description>

      <title>Detecting Homeomorphic 3-manifolds via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the enumeration of the BPS spectra of certain 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum field theories, obtained from the compactification of 6d superconformal field theories on three-manifolds, we study the homeomorphism problem for a class of graph-manifolds using Graph Neural Network techniques. Utilizing the JSJ decomposition, a unique representation via a plumbing graph is extracted from a graph-manifold. Homeomorphic graph-manifolds are related via a sequence of von Neumann moves on this graph; the algorithmic application of these moves can determine if two graphs correspond to homeomorphic graph-manifolds in super-polynomial time. However, by employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the same problem can be addressed, at the cost of accuracy, in polynomial time. We build a dataset composed of pairs of plumbing graphs, together with a hidden label encoding whether the pair is homeomorphic. We train and benchmark a variety of network architectures within a supervised learning setting by testing different combinations of two convolutional layers (GEN, GCN, GAT, NNConv), followed by an aggregation layer and a classification layer. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different GNNs for this homeomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dark Matter Abundance in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scenario to obtain the correct relic abundance for thermally under-produced dark matter. This scenario utilizes a strongly first-order phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm PT}$ that gives rise to dark matter mass $m$. Freeze-out in the broken phase can yield the desired abundance in the entire region currently allowed by observational bounds and theoretical constraints for $10^2 T_{\rm PT} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^4 T_{\rm PT}$. We show that the accompanying gravitational waves are strong enough to be detected by many upcoming and proposed experiments. This, in tandem with dark matter indirect searches, provides a multi-messenger probe of such models. Positive signals in the future can help reconstruct the potential governing the phase transition and shed light on an underlying particle physics realization.</description>

      <title>State Dependent Spread Complexity Dynamics in Many-Body Localization Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the Many-Body Localization (MBL) phase transition using the dynamics of spread complexity and inverse participation ratio in the Krylov space starting from different initial states. Our analysis of the disordered Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain unravels that the ergodic-to-MBL transition can be determined from the transition of the pre-saturation peak in the thermofield double state (TFD) spread complexity. On the other hand, if an initially ordered state or a superposition of a small number of such states is chosen, then the saturation value of spread complexity and Krylov inverse participation ratio (KIPR) can distinguish the ergodic phase from the integrable phases, with no sharp difference between the integrable phases. Interestingly, the distinction between the disorder-free integrable and the MBL integrable phase is established by the spread complexity study of random states chosen from unitary and orthogonal Haar ensembles. We also study the complexity dynamics by coupling the system to a bath, which shows distinctive profiles in different phases. A stretched exponential decay of KIPR is observed when the MBL system is connected to the bath, with the decay starting at an earlier time for a greater value of environmental dephasing. Our work sheds light on the efficacy of Krylov space dynamics in understanding phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dark Matter: Covariant Brownian Motion from Planckian Discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gravity has long remained elusive from an observational standpoint. Developing effective cosmological models motivated by the fundamental aspects of quantum gravity is crucial for bridging theory with observations. One key aspect is the granularity of spacetime, which suggests that free particles would deviate from classical geodesics by following a covariant Brownian motion. This notion is further supported by swerves models in causal set theory, a discrete approach to quantum gravity. At an effective level, such deviations are described by a stochastic correction to the geodesic equation. We show that the form of this correction is strictly restricted by covariance and the mass-shell condition. Under minimal coupling to curvature, the resulting covariant Brownian motion is unique. The process is equivalently described by a covariant diffusion equation for the distribution of massive particles in their relativistic phase space. When applied to dark matter particles, covariant Brownian motion results in spontaneous warming at late times, suppressing the matter power spectrum at small scales in a time-dependent manner. Using bounds on the diffusion rate from CMB and growth history measurements of $f\sigma_8$, we show that the model offers a resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Future studies on the model's behavior at non-linear cosmological scales will provide further constraints and, therefore, critical tests for the viability of stochastic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part Ic. Limits on lens spaces from circle searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations indicate that in the best-fit $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model of the Universe, the local geometry is consistent with at most a small amount of positive or negative curvature, i.e., $\vert\Omega_K\vert\ll1$. However, whether the geometry is flat ($E^3$), positively curved ($S^3$) or negatively curved ($H^3$), there are many possible topologies. Among the topologies of $S^3$ geometry, the lens spaces $L(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ ($p&gt;1$ and $0&lt;q&lt;p$) are positive integers, are quotients of the covering space of $S^3$ (the three-sphere) by ${\mathbb{Z}}_p$, the cyclic group of order $p$. We use the absence of any pair of circles on the CMB sky with matching patterns of temperature fluctuations to establish constraints on $p$ and $q$ as a function of the curvature scale that are considerably stronger than those previously asserted for most values of $p$ and $q$. The smaller the value of $\vert\Omega_K\vert$, i.e., the larger the curvature radius, the larger the maximum allowed value of $p$. For example, if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.05$ then $p\leq 9 $, while if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.02$, $p$ can be as high as 24. Future work will extend these constraints to a wider set of $S^{3}$ topologies.</description>

      <title>Black holes of type D revisited: relating their various metric forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a complete family of spacetimes which represent black holes with rotation, NUT twist, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges. These are exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with any cosmological constant, such that the (non-null) electromagnetic field is aligned with both the double-degenerate principal null directions of the Weyl tensor. In particular, we explicitly relate various coordinates and the corresponding physical parameters of such solutions, namely the original Plebanski-Demianski (PD) form, the convenient Astorino (A) form which was found recently, and formally improved here (A+), the Griffiths-Podolsky (GP), and Podolsky-Vratny (PV) form of the metric. It is demonstrated that, if properly mapped and physically interpreted, all these representations cover the complete class of type D black holes. Using the new A-parameters, the two main PD quartic metric functions are factorized into the product of quadratic expressions, enabling thus an explicit analysis. Moreover, we clarify the role of the twist parameter $\omega$, related to both the Kerr-like rotation and the NUT parameters $a$ and $l$, respectively. Special attention is payed to the elusive subclass of accelerating NUT black holes with $a=0$.</description>

Abstract: This note addresses the problem of constructing a proper bosonized description of the collective modes in strongly interacting (non-)Fermi liquids which is specific to two spatial dimensions. Although, in a mild form, this subtlety exists in the Fermi liquid as well, the discussion focuses on the effects of long-ranged and/or retarded interactions which can completely destroy the fermionic quasiparticles. The present analysis also provides a further insight into the nature and properties of the collective bosonic modes in such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves cause a precession in a freely falling spinning object and a net change of orientation after the passage of the wave, dubbed as the gyroscopic memory. In this paper, we will consider isolated gravitational sources in the post-Newtonian framework and compute the gyroscopic precession and memory at leading post-Newtonian (PN) orders. We make a comparison between two competing contributions: the spin memory and the nonlinear helicity flux. At the level of the precession rate, the former is a 2PN oscillatory effect, while the latter is a 4PN adiabatic effect. However, the gyroscopic memory involves a time integration, which enhances subleading adiabatic effects by the fifth power of the velocity of light, leading to a 1.5PN memory effect. We explicitly compute the leading effects for a quasi-circular binary system and obtain the angular dependence of the memory on the celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Surface Tension as the Origin for the Black Hole Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the thermodynamics of black holes using the Gouy-Stodola theorem, traditionally applied to mechanical systems relating entropy production to the difference between reversible and irreversible work. We model black holes as gravitational bubbles with surface tension defined at the event horizon, deriving the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy relation for non-rotating black holes. One extends this approach to rotating black holes, incorporating the effects of angular momentum, demonstrating that the Gouy-Stodola theorem can similarly derive the entropy-area law in this case. Additionally, we analyze the merging of two black holes, showing that the resultant total entropy exceeds the sum of the individual entropies, thereby adhering to the second law of thermodynamics. Our results suggest that gravitational surface tension is a key factor in black hole thermodynamics, providing a novel and coherent framework for understanding the entropy production in these extreme astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter (I): tr-symmetric metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering four phenomenological, regular tr-symmetric space-times, featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For three of the metrics, including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones, we show that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by up to an order of magnitude, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is instead devoted to non-tr-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical instanton theory for reaction rates at any temperature: How a rigorous real-time derivation solves the crossover temperature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instanton theory relates the rate constant for tunneling through a barrier to the periodic classical trajectory on the upturned potential energy surface whose period is $\tau=\hbar /(k_{\mathrm{B}}T)$. Unfortunately, the standard theory is only applicable below the "crossover temperature", where the periodic orbit first appears. This paper presents a rigorous semiclassical ($\hbar\to0$) theory for the rate that is valid at any temperature. The theory is derived by combining Bleistein's method for generating uniform asymptotic expansions with a real-time modification of Richardson's flux-correlation function derivation of instanton theory. The resulting theory smoothly connects the instanton result at low temperature to the parabolic correction to Eyring transition state theory at high-temperature. Although the derivation involves real time, the final theory only involves imaginary-time (thermal) properties, consistent with the standard theory. Therefore, it is no more difficult to compute than the standard theory. The theory is illustrated with application to model systems, where it is shown to give excellent numerical results. Finally, the first-principles approach taken here results in a number of advantages over previous attempts to extend the imaginary free-energy formulation of instanton theory. In addition to producing a theory that is a smooth (continuously differentiable) function of temperature, the derivation also naturally incorporates hyperasymptotic (i.e.~multi-orbit) terms, and provides a framework for further extensions of the theory.</description>

      <title>Constraints for twist-two alien operators in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton evolution equations in QCD are controlled by the anomalous dimensions of gauge-invariant twist-two spin-$N$ quark and gluon operators. Under renormalization, these mix with gauge-variant operators of the same quantum numbers, referred to as alien operators. Our work addresses the systematic study of these alien operators at arbitrary spin $N$, using generalized BRST symmetry relations to derive their couplings and Feynman rules at all values of $N$. We observe how the all-$N$ structure of the generalized (anti-)BRST constraints relates the couplings of alien operators with $n+1$ gluons to those with $n$ gluons. Realizing a bootstrap, we present all one-loop results necessary for performing the operator renormalization up to four loops in QCD.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds through the synergy of LISA and ET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) interferometers LISA and ET are expected to be functional in the next decade(s), possibly around the same time. They will operate over different frequency ranges, with similar integrated sensitivities to the amplitude of a stochastic GW background (SGWB). We investigate the synergies between these two detectors, in terms of a multi-band detection of a cosmological SGWB characterised by a large amplitude, and a broad frequency spectrum. By investigating various examples of SGWBs, such as those arising from cosmological phase transition, cosmic string, primordial inflation, we show that LISA and ET operating together will have the opportunity to assess more effectively the characteristics of the GW spectrum produced by the same cosmological source, but at separate frequency scales. Moreover, the two experiments in tandem can be sensitive to features of early universe cosmic expansion before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which affects the SGWB frequency profile, and which would not be possible to detect otherwise, since two different frequency ranges correspond to two different pre-BBN (or post-inflationary) epochs. Besides considering the GW spectrum, we additionally undertake a preliminary study of the sensitivity of LISA and ET to soft limits of higher order tensor correlation functions. Given that these experiments operate at different frequency bands, their synergy constitutes an ideal direct probe of squeezed limits of higher order GW correlators, which can not be measured operating with a single instrument only.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from binary systems in Unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity (UG) is classically considered identical to General Relativity (GR). However, due to restricted diffeomorphism symmetry, the Bianchi identites do not lead to the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. Thus, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor needs to be separately assumed in order to reconcile with GR. Relaxing this assumption, one finds that the conservation violation can lead to differences with GR, which can be subsequently examined in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. To this end, we examine the predictions of UG in the context of binary systems emitting gravitational radiation. Primarily, we show how the field equations involve a diffusion function which quantifies the measure of non-conservation. Due to this violation, the dispersion relation is modified. Incorporating these changes, we provide an expression for the energy loss by the binaries, which reduces to Peters-Mathews result in the GR limit. Using binary pulsar data, we constrain the theory parameter $\zeta$ (which signifies non-conservation) by determining the rate of orbital decay. The strongest constrain on $\zeta$ comes out to be $\vert \zeta \vert \leq 5\times 10^{-4}$ which is better by an order of magnitude than an existing equivalent constraint coming from the tidal deformability of the neutron stars.</description>

      <title>A New Solution to the Callan Rubakov Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00680v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the scattering of massive fermions off of smooth, spherically symmetric monopoles in $4d$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory. We propose a complete physical picture of the monopole-fermion interaction which encompasses all angular momentum modes. We show that as an in-going fermion scatters off a monopole, it excites trapped $W$-bosons in the monopole core by a version of the Witten effect so that the monopole can accrue charge and transform into a dyon at parametrically low energies. The imparted electric charge is then protected from decay by an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalized global symmetry, creating a stable dyon. At sufficiently low energies, the scattered fermion can be trapped by the dyon's electrostatic potential, forming a bound state, which can decay into spherically symmetric fermion modes subject to the preserved $\mathbb{Z}_N$ global symmetry. We propose that monopole-fermion scattering can be described in this way without needing to add ``new'' states to the Hilbert space, thereby eliminating a long standing confusion in the Callan Rubakov effect.</description>

Abstract: We study self-gravitating solutions of 3-dimensional massive gravity coupled to Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons gauge theory. Among these, there is a family of asymptotically Warped-Anti de Sitter black holes that come to generalize previous solutions found in the literature and studied in the context of WAdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. We also present self-gravitating solutions to the 3-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, as well as other self-gravitating solutions in the presence of higher-curvature terms.</description>

      <title>Moduli Dynamics in Effective Nested Warped Geometry in Four Dimensions and Some Cosmological Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the effective four-dimensional dynamics of the extra-dimensional moduli fields in curved braneworlds having nested warping, with particular emphasis on the doubly warped model which is interesting in the light of current collider constraints on the mass of the Kaluza-Klein graviton. The presence of a non-zero brane cosmological constant ($\Omega$) naturally induces an effective moduli potential in the four-dimensional action, which shows distinct features in dS ($\Omega&gt;0$) and AdS ($\Omega&lt;0$) branches. For the observationally interesting case of dS 4-branes, a metastable minimum in the potential arises along the first modulus, with no minima along the higher moduli. The underlying nested geometry also leads to interesting separable forms of the non-canonical kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, where the brane curvature directly impacts the kinetic properties of only the first modulus. The non-canonicity of the scenario has been illustrated via an explicit computation of the field space curvature. We subsequently explore the ability of curved multiply warped geometries to drive inflation with an in-built exit mechanism, by considering predominant slow roll along each modular direction on a case-by-case basis. We find slow roll on top of the metastable plateau along the first modular direction to be the most viable scenario, with the higher-dimensional moduli parametrically tuning the height of the potential without significant impact on the inflationary observables. On the other hand, while slow roll along the higher moduli can successfully inflate the background and eventually lead to an exit, consistency with observations seemingly requires unphysical hierarchies among the extra-dimensional radii, thus disfavouring such scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we uncover a collection of non invertible topological operators linked to the 0-, 2-, 4- and 6-form symmetries related to the type IIB superstring effective theory. By pinpointing the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$-covariant conserved currents corresponding to these symmetries, we first derive a set of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant invertible topological operators that encapsulate the integer BPS charges inherent to the theory. Moving forward, by incorporating fractional charges while maintaining gauge invariance, we introduce the non invertible topological operators for each generalized symmetry, and in particular for the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ 0-form symmetry. Identifying them as a novel kind of symmetries reminiscent of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE)-like non invertible operators, we study their action on charged objects and their associated SymTFTs obtained via half (higher) gauging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes are chaotic quantum systems that are expected to exhibit random matrix statistics in their finite energy spectrum. Lin, Maldacena, Rozenberg and Shan (LMRS) have proposed a related characterization of chaos for the ground states of BPS black holes with finite area horizons. On a separate front, the "fuzzball program" has uncovered large families of horizon-free geometries that account for the entropy of holographic BPS systems, but only in situations with sufficient supersymmetry to exclude finite area horizons. The highly structured, non-random nature of these solutions seems in tension with strong chaos. We verify this intuition by performing analytic and numerical calculations of the LMRS diagnostic in the corresponding boundary quantum system. In particular we examine the 1/2 and 1/4-BPS sectors of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, and the two charge sector of the D1-D5 CFT. We find evidence that these systems are only weakly chaotic, with a Thouless time determining the onset of chaos that grows as a power of $N$. In contrast, finite horizon area BPS black holes should be strongly chaotic, with a Thouless time of order one. In this case, finite energy chaotic states become BPS as $N$ is decreased through the recently discovered "fortuity" mechanism. Hence they can plausibly retain their strongly chaotic character.</description>

Abstract: We present a theory of false vacuum decay induced by spherical nucleation seeds. The type of seed considered has a boundary characterised by surface energy terms. The theory applies to false vacuum decay at zero and finite temperatures. Seeded nucleation may be important for enabling future false vacuum decay experiments on analogue systems using Bose Einstein Condensates (BEC). We show that our theory of seeded nucleation at finite temperature applied to a potassium BEC in two spatial dimensions agrees with numerical, real-time, simulations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the most general gauging operations in 2+1 dimensional oriented field theories with finite symmetry groups, which correspond to gapped boundary conditions in 3+1 dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. The classification is achieved by enumerating 2+1 dimensional oriented topological quantum field theories that cancel the 't Hooft anomaly associated with the symmetry. This framework is rigorously formulated using twisted crossed extensions of modular fusion categories and projective 3-representations. Additionally, we explore the resulting fusion 2-category symmetries and argue that this framework captures all possible categorical symmetries in 2+1 dimensional oriented field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly gives rise to certain modifications in the conserved currents. In the case of the Maxwell gauge fields there appears a new contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the chiral magnetic effect and it is widely discussed in the current literature. In the case of the gravitational field, the anomaly, as we show here, induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the possible manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and in hydrodynamics in the chiral media. We also make some comments regarding the backreaction effects in electrodynamics in the chiral media. In each of these directions we observe the systematical appearance of the Beltrami type fields. In electrodynamics or in hydrodynamics the Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector that is parallel to its own curl. We suggest a generalization of the Beltrami fields for the tensorial gravitational perturbations. The respective solutions to the gravitational equations we call gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics in the chiral media the vorticity is asymptotically a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>

      <title>Extremal rotating BTZ black holes cannot be dressed in (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the (anti-)self-dual condition for orthonormal components of the Faraday tensor, the 3D Einstein-Maxwell system with a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$ admits a solution obtained by Kamata and Koikawa and later by Cataldo and Salgado in the most general form. Actually, Clement first obtained this solution and interpreted it as a regular particle-like solution without horizon. Nevertheless, it has been erroneously stated in some literature that this Clement-Cataldo-Salgado (CCS) solution, locally characterized by a single parameter, describes a black hole even in the charged case as it reduces to the extremal rotating Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) solution in the vacuum limit and its curvature invariants are constant. In this paper, we supplement Clement's interpretation by showing that there appears a parallelly propagated curvature singularity corresponding to an infinite affine parameter along spacelike geodesics at the location of the Killing horizon in the extremal rotating BTZ solution when the (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field is added. If the spatial coordinate $\theta$ is periodic, closed timelike curves exist near the singularity. It is also shown that the CCS solution is of the Cotton type N (in contrast to charged rotating BTZ black holes which are of type I away from the horizon), and the energy-momentum tensor of the Maxwell field is of the Hawking-Ellis type II. The metric solves the Einstein-$\Lambda$ equations also with a massless scalar field or a null dust fluid. We demonstrate that it belongs to the Kundt shear-free, non-twisting, non-expanding class of geometries, whereas extremal rotating BTZ black holes have expanding principal null directions. It means that the CCS metric represents the specific null ("radiative") Maxwell field generated by a singular source, rather than an extremal rotating BTZ black hole dressed in an (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field.</description>

      <title>Fusion of irreducible modules in the periodic Temperley--Lieb algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new family ${\sf Y}_{k,\ell,x,y,[z,w]}$ of modules over the enlarged periodic Temperley--Lieb algebra ${\sf{\cal E}PTL}_N(\beta)$. These modules are built from link states with two marked points, similarly to the modules ${\sf X}_{k,\ell,x,y,z}$ that we constructed in a previous paper. They however differ in the way that defects connect pairwise. We analyse the decomposition of ${\sf Y}_{k,\ell,x,y,[z,w]}$ over the irreducible standard modules ${\sf W}_{k,x}$ for generic values of the parameters $z$ and $w$, and use it to deduce the fusion rules for the fusion $\sf W \times W$ of standard modules. These turn out to be more symmetric than those obtained previously using the modules ${\sf X}_{k,\ell,x,y,z}$.
  From the work of Graham and Lehrer, it is known that, for $\beta=-q-q^{-1}$ where $q$ is not a root of unity, there exists a set of non-generic values of the twist $y$ for which the standard module ${\sf W}_{\ell,y}$ is indecomposable yet reducible with two composition factors: a radical submodule ${\sf R}_{\ell,y}$ and a quotient module ${\sf Q}_{\ell,y}$. Here, we construct the fusion products $\sf W\times R$, $\sf W\times Q$ and $\sf Q\times Q$, and analyse their decomposition over indecomposable modules. For the fusions involving the quotient modules ${\sf Q}$, we find very simple results reminiscent of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ fusion rules.
  This construction with modules ${\sf Y}_{k,\ell,x,y,[z,w]}$ is a good lattice regularization of the operator product expansion in the underlying logarithmic bulk conformal field theory. Indeed, it fits with the correspondence between standard modules and connectivity operators, and is useful for the calculation of their correlation functions. Remarkably, we show that the fusion rules $\sf W\times Q$ and $\sf Q\times Q$ are consistent with the known fusion rules of degenerate primary fields.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points and quantum phase transition in a fermionic extension of the Swanson oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the structure of the Swanson oscillator which is a well-known example of a non-Hermitian quantum system consisting of a general representation of a quadratic Hamiltonian, we propose a fermionic extension of such a scheme which incorporates two fermionic oscillators together with bilinear-coupling terms that do not conserve particle number. We determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and expose the appearance of exceptional points where two of the eigenstates coalesce with the corresponding eigenvectors exhibiting self-orthogonality with respect to the bi-orthogonal inner product. The model admits a quantum phase transition - we discuss the two phases and also demonstrate that the ground-state entanglement entropy exhibits a discontinuous jump indicating the transition between the two phases.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Hawking Evaporation opens new Mass Window for Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy injection through Hawking evaporation has been used to put strong constraints on primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate at masses below $10^{17}\,\rm{g}$. However, Hawking's semiclassical approximation breaks down at latest after half-decay. Beyond this point, the evaporation could be significantly suppressed, as was shown in recent work. In this study, we review existing cosmological and astrophysical bounds on primordial black holes, taking this effect into account. We show that the constraints disappear completely for a reasonable range of parameters, which opens a new window below $10^{10}\,\rm{g}$ for light primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved quantities within a subsystem are non-local observables that provide unique insights into quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we explore the behaviors of bipartite charge (and spin) fluctuations across interaction-driven "metal-insulator transitions" out of Landau Fermi liquids. The "charge insulators" include a class of non-Fermi-liquid states of fractionalized degrees of freedom, such as compressible composite Fermi liquids (for spinless electrons) and incompressible spin-liquid Mott insulators (for spin-$1/2$ electrons). We find that charge fluctuations $F$ exhibit distinct leading-order scalings across the phase transition: $F \sim L\log(L)$ in Landau Fermi liquids and $F \sim L$ in charge insulators, where $L$ is the linear size of the subsystem under bipartition. In the case of composite Fermi liquids (under certain conditions), we also identify a universal constant term $-f(\theta)|\sigma_{xy}|/(2\pi)$ arising when the subsystem geometry incorporates a sharp corner. Here, $f(\theta)$ represents a function of the corner angle, and $\sigma_{xy}$ denotes the Hall conductivity. At the critical point of each example, provided the transition is continuous, we find that the leading-order scaling $F \sim L$ is accompanied by a subleading universal corner contribution $-\log(L)f(\theta)C_{\rho}/2$ with the same angle dependence $f(\theta)$. The universal coefficient $C_{\rho}$ is linked to the predicted universal longitudinal (and Hall) resistivity jump $\Delta\rho_{xx}$ (and $\Delta\rho_{xy}$) at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Understanding the puzzle of angular momentum conservation in beta decay and related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We ask the question of how angular momentum is conserved in electroweak interaction processes. To introduce the problem with a minimum of mathematics, we first raise the same issue in elastic scattering of a circularly polarized photon by an atom, where the scattered photon has a different spin direction than the original photon, and note its presence in scattering of a fully relativistic spin-1/2 particle by a central potential. We then consider inverse beta decay in which an electron is emitted following the capture of a neutrino on a nucleus. While both the incident neutrino and final electron spins are antiparallel to their momenta, the final spin is in a different direction than that of the neutrino -- an apparent change of angular momentum. However, prior to measurement of the final particle, in all these cases angular momentum is indeed conserved, The apparent non-conservation of angular momentum arises in the quantum measurement process in which the measuring apparatus does not have an initially well-defined angular momentum, but is localized in the outside world. We generalize the discussion to massive neutrinos and electrons, and examine nuclear beta decay and electron-positron annihilation processes through the same lens, enabling physically transparent derivations of angular and helicity distributions in these reactions.</description>

      <title>Wormhole formations in the galactic halos supported by dark matter models and global monopole charge within $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the possibility of traversable wormholes in the galactic region supported by dark matter (DM) models and global monopole charge in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. To understand the features of the wormholes, we comprehensively studied wormhole solutions with various redshift functions under different $f(Q)$ models. We obtained wormhole shape functions for Pseudo Isothermal (PI) and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profiles under linear $f(Q)$ gravity. In contrast, we employed an embedding class I approach for the non-linear $f(Q)$ models to investigate wormholes. We noticed that our obtained shape functions satisfy the flare-out conditions under an asymptotic background for each DM profile. Moreover, we checked the energy conditions at the wormhole throat with a radius $r_0$ and noticed the influences of the global monopole's parameter $\eta$ in the violation of energy conditions, especially null energy conditions. Further, for the non-linear case, we observed that wormhole solutions could not exist for $f(Q)=Q+mQ^n$, $f(Q)=Q+\frac{\beta}{Q}$, and $f(Q)=\alpha_1+\beta_1 \log(Q)$ under embedding class I approach. Finally, we study the amount of exotic matter via the volume integral quantifier technique for the linear $f(Q)$ model, and we confirm that a small amount of exotic matter is required to sustain the traversable wormholes.</description>
