      <title>Unitary causal decompositions: a combinatorial characterisation via lattice theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a unitary transformation has a decomposition into a quantum circuit with no directed path from input $a$ to output $b$, then $a$ does not influence $b$ through the overall unitary. Conversely, it is known that if $a$ does not influence $b$, one may always find a circuit decomposition lacking a path between these systems, thus making the no-influence condition directly apparent in the connectivity of the circuit. Causal decompositions are circuit decompositions in which, more generally, multiple such no-influence conditions are made apparent simultaneously. They bridge two fundamental concepts in quantum causality: causal structure, as expressed by influences through unitary transformations (and related to signalling through quantum channels); and compositional structure, expressed in terms of the shape of quantum circuits or networks. The general existence of causal decompositions remains unknown.
  This work focusses on unitary causal decompositions, i.e. decompositions in terms of unitary circuits in the traditional quantum circuit formalism that do not require the generalisation to `extended' or `routed' quantum circuits prompted by earlier research on this topic. We identify a combinatorial condition that characterises precisely those sets of causal no-influence constraints $G$ for which any unitary transformation satisfying $G$ has a unitary causal decomposition compositionally representing those constraints. Our methods are based on finite-dimensional operator algebra as well as the concept lattice construction, which was recently shown to provide a canonical shape $L_G$ for causal decompositions. The combinatorial condition we identify can be formulated in terms of $G$ as the absence of a forbidden substructure $C_3$ and in terms of $L_G$ as the existence of no more than one path between each input and output.</description>

      <title>On the compatibility of the Betti harmonic coproduct with cyclotomic filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, the second author introduced a Betti counterpart of $N$-cyclotomic double shuffle theory for any $N \geq 1$. The construction is based on the group algebra of the free group $F_2$, endowed with a filtration relative to a morphism $F_2 \to \mu_N$ (where $\mu_N$ is the group of $N$-th roots of unity). One of the main results therein is the construction of a complete Hopf algebra coproduct $\widehat{\Delta}^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}_N$ on the relative completion of a specific subalgebra $\mathcal{W}^\mathrm{B}$ of the group algebra of $F_2$. However, an explicit formula for this coproduct is missing. In this paper, we show that the discrete Betti harmonic coproduct $\Delta^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}$ defined in \cite{EF1} for the classical case ($N=1$) by the first author and Furusho remains compatible with the filtration structure on $\mathcal{W}^\mathrm{B}$ induced by the relative completion for arbitrary $N$. This compatibility suggests that the completion corresponding to $\Delta^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}$ is a candidate for an explicit realization of $\widehat{\Delta}^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}_N$.</description>

      <title>Tilting theory for hypersurface singularities of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was shown by Buchweitz, the first author, and Yamaura that any $\mathbb{N}$-graded commutative Gorenstein ring $R$ of Krull dimension one with $R_0$ a field admits a standard silting object $V$ in the stable category $\underline{\mathrm{CM}\, \!}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$. Moreover, they proved that the object $V$ is tilting if and only if the $a$-invariant $a$ is non-negative. In this article, under the additional assumption that $R$ is a hypersurface singularity, we give an explicit description of the endomorphism algebra of $V$ and prove that it is Iwanaga-Gorenstein of self-injective dimension at most $2$. In the case of where $a$ is negative, we give an explicit description of the endomorphism dg algebra of $V$ and prove that it is Gorenstein. Moreover, we give a characterization of Gorensteinness of homologically finite dg algebras in terms of Serre functors.</description>

      <title>Silting correspondences and Calabi-Yau dg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying two important classes of objects in triangulated categories; silting objects and $d$-cluster tilting objects, and their correspondences. First, we introduce the notion of $d$-silting objects as a generalization tilting objects whose endomorphism algebras have global dimension at most $d$. For a smooth dg algebra $A$ and its $(d+1)$-Calabi-Yau completion $\Pi$, we show that the induction functor gives an embedding from the poset $\operatorname{silt}^dA$ of $d$-silting objects of $A$ to the poset $\operatorname{silt}\Pi$ of silting objects of $\Pi$. Moreover, when $H^0\Pi$ is finite dimensional, this functor identifies the Hasse quiver of $\operatorname{silt}^dA$ as a full subquiver of the Hasse quiver of $\operatorname{silt}\Pi$. In this case, we also prove that each $d$-silting object $P$ of $A$ gives a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of $\operatorname{per} A$ as the $\nu[-d]$-orbit of $P$. Secondly, for a connective Calabi-Yau dg algebra $\Pi$, we study the map from $\operatorname{silt}\Pi$ to the set $d\text{-}\operatorname{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ of $d$-cluster tilting objects in the cluster category $\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$. We call $\Pi$ $\mathcal{F}$-liftable if the induced map $\operatorname{silt}\Pi\cap\mathcal{F}\to d\text{-}\operatorname{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ is bijective, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the fundamental domain in $\operatorname{per}\Pi$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}$-liftable Calabi-Yau dg algebras $\Pi$ such that $H^0\Pi$ is hereditary are precisely the Calabi-Yau completions of hereditary algebras. As an application, we obtain counter-examples to an open question posed in [IYa1]. We also study Calabi-Yau dg algebras such that the map $\operatorname{silt}\Pi\to d\text{-}\operatorname{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ is surjective, which we call liftable. We explain our results by polynomial dg algebras and Calabi-Yau completions of type $A_2$.</description>

      <title>On Banach subalgebras of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ consisting of lacunary Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ be the set of all Dirichlet series $f=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nn^{-s}$ (where $a_n\in\mathbb{C}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\cdots\}$) that converge at each $s$ in $\mathbb{C}_0=\{s\in \mathbb{C}:\text{Re}(s)&gt;0\}$, such that $\|f\|_{\infty}=\sup_{s\in\mathbb{C}_0}|f(s)|&lt;\infty$. Then $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ is a Banach algebra with pointwise operations and the supremum norm $\|\cdot\|_\infty$, and has been studied in earlier works. The article introduces a new family of Banach subalgebras $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$. For $S\subset\mathbb{N}$, let $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ be the set of all elements $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nn^{-s}\in \mathscr{H}^\infty$ such that for all $n\in \mathbb{N}\setminus S$, we have $a_n=0$. Then $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is a unital Banach subalgebra of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ with the supremum norm if and only if $S$ is a multiplicative subsemigroup of $\mathbb{N}$ containing $1$. It is shown that for such $S$, $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is the multiplier algebra of $\mathscr{H}^2_S$, where $\mathscr{H}^2_S$ is the Hilbert space of all Dirichlet series $f=\sum_{n\in S} a_nn^{-s}$ such that $\|f\|_2:=(\sum_{n\in S} |a_n|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;\infty$. A characterisation of the group of units in $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is also given, by showing an analogue of the Wiener $1/f$ theorem for $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study operads with trivial $\mathbb{A}$-actions and prove an equivalence between the category of $\mathbb{A}$-trivial operads and that of pseudo-graded-Perm associative algebras. As a consequence, we show that finitely generated $\mathbb{A}$-trivial operads are right noetherian of integral Gelfand-Kirillov dimension and that every element in a prime $\mathbb{A}$-trivial operad is central.</description>

      <title>Numerical homological regularities over positively graded algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerical regularities for complexes over noncommutative noetherian locally finite $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebras $A$ such as CM (cm)-regularity, Tor (tor)-regularity (Ext (ext)-regularity) and Ex (ex)-regularity, which are the supremum or infimum degrees of some associated canonical complexes. We show that for any right bounded complex $X$ with finitely generated cohomologies, the supremum degree of $R\underline{\text{Hom}}_A(X, A_0)$ coincides with the opposite of the infimum degree of $X$ if $A_0$ is semisimple. If $A$ has a balanced dualizing complex and $A_0$ is semisimple, we prove that the CM-regularity of $X$ coincides with the supremum degree of $R\underline{\text{Hom}}_A(A_0,X)$ for any left bounded complex $X$ with finitely generated cohomologies.
  Several inequalities concerning the numerical regularities and the supremum or infimum degree of derived Hom or derived tensor complexes are given for noncommutative noetherian locally finite $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebras. Some of these are generalizations of J\o rgensen's results on the inequalities between the CM-regularity and Tor-regularity, some are new even in the connected graded case. Conditions are given under which the inequalities become equalities by establishing two technical lemmas.
  Following Kirkman, Won and Zhang, we also use the numerical AS-regularity (resp. little AS-regularity) to study Artin-Schelter regular property (finite-dimensional property) for noetherian $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebras. We prove that the numerical AS-regularity of $A$ is zero if and only if that $A$ is an $\mathbb{N}$-graded AS-regular algebra under some mild conditions, which generalizes a result of Dong-Wu and a result of Kirkman-Won-Zhang. If $A$ has a balanced dualizing complex and $A_0$ is semisimple, we prove that the little AS-regularity of $A$ is zero if and only if $A$ is finite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa Theory for GU(2,1) at inert primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many problems of arithmetic nature rely on the computation or analysis of values of $L$-functions attached to objects from geometry. Whilst basic analytic properties of the $L$-functions can be difficult to understand, recent research programs have shown that automorphic $L$-values are susceptible to study via algebraic methods linking them to Selmer groups. Iwasawa theory, pioneered first by Iwasawa in the 1960s and later Mazur and Wiles provides an algebraic recipe to obtain a $p$-adic analogue of the $L$-function. In this work we aim to adapt Iwasawa theory to a new context of representations of the unitary group GU(2,1) at primes inert in the respective imaginary quadratic field. This requires a novel approach using the Schneider--Venjakob regulator map, working over locally analytic distribution algebras. Subsequently, we show vanishing of some Bloch--Kato Selmer groups when a certain $p$-adic distribution is non-vanishing. These results verify cases of the Bloch--Kato conjecture for GU(2,1) at inert primes in rank 0.</description>
