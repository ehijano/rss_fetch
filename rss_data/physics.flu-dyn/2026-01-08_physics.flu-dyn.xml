      <title>X-CAL: Explaining latent causality in physical space for fluid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-CAL, a pipeline that combines a $\beta$-variational autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE) with the synergistic-unique-redundant decomposition (SURD)~\cite{surd} approach for causality analysis to interpret low-dimensional latent representations of turbulent fluid flows. Combining $\beta$-VAE compression with SURD and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) yields interpretable latent representations and structure-level attributions in physical space, offering a general methodology for causal analysis of high-dimensional flows. Using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of the flow around a wall-mounted square cylinder at $Re_h=2000$, we (i) learn a compact latent space with near-orthogonal variables, (ii) quantify directed information flows among these variables via the SURD approach, and (iii) map latent-space causality back to physical space through gradient-SHAP fields . By means of percolation analysis of the SHAP fields, we extract the coherent, time-resolved structures that most influence each latent variable. The analysis connects coherent structures with latent variables which are in turn associated with wake-boundary-layer interactions. This method enables translating the insight obtained through causal analysis in the latent space into interpretable phenomena in physical space.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Metric Two-Field Framework for Turbulence: Emergent Stress Anisotropy and Wall Asymptotics from a Single Scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work~\cite{SanchisAgudoVinuesa2025PRL}, we argued that viscous dissipation in turbulence can be understood as the macroscopic imprint of microscopic path uncertainty, and showed that a kernel variance field $s(y)$ constrained by a balance condition yields both the Kolmogorov scales and the logarithmic law of the wall from a single stochastic principle. In the present work we promote $s$ to a dynamical field $s(\bm{x},t)$ with units of kinematic viscosity and develop a two-field framework in which the velocity $\ve$ and an \emph{intermittency} (or stochastic diffusivity) field $s$ evolve in a coupled way. The effective viscosity is $\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}=\nu_0+s$, but the stress tensor is generalized to include a non-linear closure driven by the commutator of strain and rotation, $[\bm{S}, \bm{\Omega}]$, capturing emergent anisotropy. The evolution of $s$ is defined as a mixed-metric gradient flow: a Wasserstein-2 gradient flow for morphology, $\Div(s\grad s)$, combined with a local $L^2$ gradient flow driven by an objective coupling term $q$. The coupling is decomposed as $q=q_{\mathrm{prod}}-q_{\mathrm{relax}}$, where production is driven by a vortex-stretching invariant, $\mathcal{I} = \|\bm{S}\boldsymbol{\omega}\|^2$. This choice ensures that production vanishes identically in strictly two-dimensional flows. We show that, under standard assumptions of constant stress, high Reynolds number and overlap-layer scale invariance, the only scale-invariant overlap-layer solution of the mixed-metric equation is $s(y)\propto y$, which recovers the logarithmic velocity profile. Thus the same mixed-metric equation organizes both wall-resolved and wall-modeled asymptotics within a single, energetically constrained framework.</description>

      <title>Lensing Capillary Waves with a Meniscus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of water waves is altered when interacting with curved surfaces. Here, we consider the problem of capillary waves interacting with a 3D meniscus. We show that when capillary waves scatter off an object surrounded by a meniscus, the resulting wavefield can be drastically altered and lensing phenomena is observed. Our results are not only an important step in surface tension dominated wave interactions, but may have implications in the biological communication of surface dwelling animals.</description>

      <title>PhysicsFormer: An Efficient and Fast Attention-Based Physics Informed Neural Network for Solving Incompressible Navier Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional experimental and numerical approaches for fluid dynamics problems often suffer from high computational cost, mesh sensitivity, and limited capability in capturing complex physical behaviors. Moreover, conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) frequently struggle in chaotic and highly unsteady flow regimes. In this work, we propose \textit{PhysicsFormer}, a fast and efficient transformer-based physics-informed framework that incorporates multi-head encoder-decoder cross-attention. Unlike multilayer perceptron-based PINNs, PhysicsFormer operates on sequential representations constructed from spatio-temporal data, enabling effective learning of long-range temporal dependencies and improved propagation of initial condition information. A data-embedding strategy is employed to convert spatio-temporal points into pseudo-sequences, while a dynamics-weighted loss function replaces the standard PINNs formulation. Owing to its parallel learning structure, PhysicsFormer demonstrates superior computational efficiency compared to existing transformer-based approaches. The framework is validated on Burgers' equation and flow reconstruction governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, achieving mean squared errors on the order of $10^{-6}$. In addition, an inverse problem involving parameter identification in the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is investigated. For clean data, PhysicsFormer achieves zero identification error for both $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$; under $1\%$ Gaussian noise, the errors are $0.07\%$ for $\lambda_1$ and $0\%$ for $\lambda_2$. These results demonstrate that PhysicsFormer provides a reliable and computationally efficient surrogate modeling framework for time-dependent fluid flow problems.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Thermo-Fluid Model for Pressure-Driven Extraction in a Moka Pot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moka pot provides a familiar example of a thermally driven flow system in which heating, vapor pressure generation, and fluid extraction are strongly coupled. We present a minimal, dimensionless dynamical model describing the evolution of temperature, pressure, and extracted volume during moka pot brewing. The model consists of a small set of coupled ordinary differential equations incorporating constant heating, heat loss, vapor pressure buildup, and pressure-driven flow through the coffee bed. The heating stage of the model is quantitatively compared with published experimental temperature time data, allowing the characteristic thermal timescale to be fixed independently. Using the experimentally constrained temperature evolution as input, the model predicts the pressure rise and identifies the onset of extraction without additional fitting parameters. Despite its simplicity, the model exhibits several qualitatively distinct extraction regimes, including delayed onset of flow, smooth extraction, and rapid extraction driven by nonlinear feedback between temperature and pressure. These regimes are governed by a small number of dimensionless parameters with clear physical interpretation. Rather than providing detailed quantitative predictions for specific devices, the model is intended as a transparent pedagogical framework for illustrating how physicists construct, simplify, and test coupled thermo-fluid models using experimentally accessible data in an everyday physical system in an everyday physical context.</description>

      <title>Most probable path and invariant sets in noise-induced transition to turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence transition often arises from a subcritical transition between bistable states characterized by invariant sets of deterministic dynamical systems, and such transitions can be triggered by system noise as rare events. In this study, we employ the Onsager-Machlup (OM) formulation of stochastic dynamics to examine the Hamilton equations governing the most probable transition paths (MPPs). We introduce an effective potential function, termed the OM potential, which depends on the noise strength. Focusing on the Dauchot-Manneville model as a minimal system with an edge state, we comprehensively analyze the MPP between laminar and turbulent states for different transition times. We find that the MPPs cross the separatrix at nearly the same point regardless of the transition time, and the obtained OM action values suggest that the transition to turbulence occurs more frequently than the transition to the laminar state. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that the noise-induced transition paths follow the OM potential landscape and its bifurcation diagram, indicating that the qualitative behavior of the MPPs is determined by the OM potential. Our methodology formulated in general dynamical systems provides a theoretical basis for predicting noise-induced transitions among invariant sets of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Pressure Drop in Non-Spherical Packed Beds: Influence of Geometry and Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding fluid flow through porous media with complex geometries is essential for improving the design and operation of packed-bed reactors. Most existing studies focus on spherical packings, having as a consequence that accurate models for irregular interstitial geometries are scarce. In this study, we numerically investigated the flow through a set of packed-bed geometries consisting of square bars stacked on top of each other and arranged in disk-shaped modules. Rotation of each module allows the generation of a variety of geometrical configurations at Reynolds numbers of up to 200 (based on the bar size). Simulations were carried out using the open-source solver OpenFOAM. Selected cases (e.g., $\alpha = 30^\circ$, $\mathrm{Re}_\mathrm{p} = 100, 200$) were compared against Particle Image Velocimetry measurements. Results reveal that, based on the relative rotation angle, the realized geometries can be classified as channel-like ($\alpha \leq 20^\circ$ and $\alpha = 90^\circ$) and lattice-like, fundamentally altering the friction factor. Furthermore, the maximum friction factor obtained in the creeping regime occurred at $\alpha = 25^\circ$, whereas in the inertial regime, this occurred at $\alpha = 60^\circ$. Varying the rotation angle also affects the transition from the viscous to the inertial regime.</description>

      <title>Microbubble surface instabilities in a strain stiffening viscoelastic material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of instabilities along fluid-solid interfaces is critical for the efficacy of focused ultrasound therapy tools (e.g., histotripsy) and microcavitation rheometry techniques. Non-uniform pressure fields generated by either ultrasound or a focused laser can cause non-spherical microcavitation bubbles. Previous perturbation amplitude evolution models in viscoelastic materials either assume pure radial deformation or have inconsistent kinematic fields between the fluid and solid contributions. We derive a kinematically-consistent theoretical model for the evolution of surface perturbations. The model captures the non-linear kinematics of a strain-stiffening viscoelastic material surrounding a non-spherical bubble. The model is validated for (i) small, approximately linear radial oscillations and (ii) large inertial oscillations using laser-induced microcavitation experiments in a soft hydrogel. For the former, the bubble is allowed to reach mechanical equilibrium, and then surface perturbations are excited using ultrasound forcing. For the latter, the microbubble forms small bubble surface perturbations at its maximum radius that grow during collapse. The model's dominant surface perturbation mode scales linearly with equilibrium radius and matches experiments. Similarly, the model's perturbation amplitude evolution sufficiently constrains the rheometry problem and is experimentally validated.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Structure-Performance Trade-offs in Porous Transport Layers for PEM Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable hydrogen production using proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers depends on overcoming efficiency losses arising from coupled multiphase, multicomponent transport and interfacial phenomena across the membrane electrode assembly. Here, we demonstrate a multiscale computational framework that combines pore network modeling with finite-element-based reactive transport simulations to accurately and efficiently resolve structure-performance trade-offs in porous transport layers (PTLs). We perform experiments for both commercial single-layer PTLs and microporous layer (MPL)-integrated configurations to benchmark the electrochemical model, achieving excellent agreement between modeling and measurements. We show that in single-layer PTLs, open porous networks facilitate mass transport but incur large voltage penalties from PTL-anode catalyst layer (ACL) contact resistance. Bilayer architectures with dense MPLs reduce these losses by simultaneously improving transport, contact, and structural stability. Finally, in stratified multilayer stacks, combining fine pores near the ACL with highly porous backing layers delivers superior performance at high current densities. Altogether, these results establish mechanistic guidelines for porosity-informed PTL design that minimize interfacial resistance and enable high-efficiency PEMWE operation.</description>

      <title>Ghost-Mode Filtered Fluctuating Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuating lattice Boltzmann solvers are widely employed to model mesoscopic fluid behavior in soft-matter systems, including colloidal suspensions and dilute polymer solutions. Despite their utility, these methods can lose accuracy and stability when non-hydrodynamic modes interfere with the dynamics, especially in single--relaxation-time schemes. Here, we introduce a ghost-mode filtered fluctuating lattice Boltzmann method (GMF-FLBM) for the D3Q27 lattice, obtained by selectively eliminating the propagation of the ghost deterministic content while preserving the necessary stochastic forcing. We show, over a broad range of relaxation times, that GMF-FLBM recovers the amplitudes of equilibrium fluctuations with a comparable accuracy as a fully regularized high-order formulation, while requiring only minor adjustments to the conventional BGK collision framework.</description>

      <title>Two Charging Mechanisms in Contact Electrification of Liquid and Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic and fundamental origin of slide electrification, where droplets of water move across insulating surfaces accumulating and depositing electrical charges, is still debated. Charge transfer is often attributed to ion transfer at the receding contact line. However, it is still unclear whether ion transfer alone can fully account for the observed charge separation. We examined slide electrification of two polar, self-ionizing liquids (water, formamide) and two non-polar liquids (diiodomethane, bromonaphthalene). By cooling below the melting temperature, we were able to compare this process to tribocharging of the respective frozen components. Despite having ions immobilized at sub-freezing temperatures, the ice of the polar liquids continues to accumulate significant charge. Non-polar liquids exhibit lower charging (&lt;25% of polar liquids) and nearly identical charging behaviour in both their liquid and frozen phases on five different substrates. Since non-polar liquids contain few free ions, these observations indicate an alternative charging mechanism, which could be electron transfer. Our findings suggest that slide electrification operates through two mechanisms, with the dominant charge transfer pathway shifting between ions and electron transfer depending on the electronegativity, phase, and temperature.</description>

      <title>Effects of Horizontal Discretization on Triangular and Hexagonal Grids on Linear Baroclinic and Symmetric Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As global ocean general circulation models are run at eddy-permitting resolutions, reproducing accurate growth rates of baroclinic instabilities is a major concern when choosing a discretization of the equations of motion. From this viewpoint, we analyze discretizations on triangular and hexagonal grids with different types of variable staggering used in several ocean circulation models. By extending the linear baroclinic instability analysis in the Eady configuration to discretizations on more complex grids, several numerical subtleties are revealed. In comparison to discretizations on quadrilateral grids, the analyzed discretizations are less robust against unstable spurious modes, partly created by the mesh geometry. Some of the subtleties arise because spurious modes on staggered triangular and hexagonal grids do not adhere to Galilean invariance. As a consequence, their growth rates demonstrate a dependence on the alignment between the background flow and the grid, as well as the strength of a uniform background flow. The interactions with spurious modes become more significant on the axis of symmetric instabilities where the physical and spurious branches of instability are more difficult to separate in wavenumber space. Our analysis shows that in most cases moderate biharmonic viscosity and diffusion suppress spurious branches. However, one needs to carefully calibrate the viscosity and diffusivity parameters for each of the considered discretizations in order to achieve this.</description>

      <title>Holey sheets: Double-Threshold Rupture of Draining Liquid Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical rupture is attributed to molecular (van der Waals) forces acting at nanometric thicknesses. Nonetheless, micron-thick liquid sheets routinely perforate far above the scale where these molecular forces act, yet the mechanism that selects opening versus healing has remained unclear. Using direct numerical simulations of a draining sheet with an entrained air bubble (cavity), we show that irreversible rupture occurs only when a deterministic double-threshold is crossed: (i) the outward driving (from airflow or inertia) is strong enough and (ii) the cavity is distorted enough. If either condition falls short, surface tension heals the cavity and the sheet reseals. The time for this process is set by the balance between inertia and viscosity -- fast for inertia-dominated sheets and slower for viscous ones. This double-threshold mechanism explains why micrometer-thick films perforate and offers practical control options -- driving strength and defect geometry -- for predicting and controlling breakup in spray formation processes, wave breaking, and respiratory films.</description>

      <title>Flow Development in the Entrance Region of Slender Converging Pipes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an analytical investigation of the hydrodynamic entrance region in laminar flows through slender converging pipes. Extending previous analyses for straight pipes, the model radially divides the flow into a viscous wall region and a central core where both inertia and viscous effects are important. The study analyzes the impact of the inlet Reynolds number and convergence angle on the velocity profile and pressure drop. Results show that a converging geometry, which imposes a favorable pressure gradient, significantly shortens the hydrodynamic entrance length compared to a straight pipe. Analytical solutions show good agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the interaction of an initially uniform near-inertial wave (NIW) field with a steady background flow, with the goal of predicting the subsequent organization of the wave field. To wit, we introduce an exact analogy between the Young Ben Jelloul (YBJ) equation and the quantum dynamics of a charged particle in a steady electromagnetic field, whose potentials are expressed in terms of the background flow. We derive the time-averaged spatial distributions of wave kinetic energy, potential energy and Stokes drift in two asymptotic limits. In the `strongly quantum' limit where the background flow is weak compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by extending a strong-dispersion expansion initially introduced by YBJ. In the `quasi-classical' limit where the background flow is strong compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by leveraging the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical systems. We compare our predictions to numerical simulations of the YBJ equation, using an instantaneous snapshot from a two-dimensional turbulent flow as the steady background flow. The agreement is very good in both limits. In particular, we quantitatively describe the preferential concentration of NIW energy in anticyclones. We predict weak NIW concentration in both asymptotic limits of weak and strong background flow, and maximal anticyclonic concentration for background flows of intermediate strength, providing theoretical underpinning to observations reported by Danioux, Vanneste and B\"uhler (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 773, 2015).</description>

      <title>Electroosmotic lubrication flow in constricted microchannels with a compliant wall and DLVO interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a nonlinear model for electroosmotic transport in a constricted microchannel with a compliant lower wall, with applications to soft microfluidics, bio-inspired sensing, and energy harvesting. The formulation couples electroosmotic slip-driven flow under a globally constrained electric field with pressure-driven lubrication and elastic wall deformation, modeled as a clamped Kirchhoff-Love plate. Short-range intermolecular stresses are incorporated through an extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek framework combining electrostatic double-layer repulsion and van der Waals attraction, enabling us to probe the nonlinear coupling between intermolecular forces, wall deformation, and electroosmotic flow in compliant microchannels. The flow is governed by six nondimensional parameters: wall compliance, geometric curvature, electrostatic and van der Waals strengths, scaled Debye length, and Dukhin number. Asymptotic analysis clarifies the role of these parameters in limiting regimes. In the stiff-wall limit, electroosmotic slip acts as a uniform offset to the pressure-driven flow. Fully coupled spectral collocation simulations confirm the asymptotic predictions and capture nonlinear feedback between pressure, deformation, and intermolecular stresses. Three regimes emerge: a stiff-wall regime with negligible deformation, a deformation-limited regime in which elastic narrowing strongly suppresses flux, and a repulsion-limited regime where DLVO forces cap wall deflection and prevent collapse. These results show how elasticity, geometry, and molecular forces jointly regulate electroosmotic lubrication and provide scaling rules for the design of compliant electrokinetic channels operating under nanometric confinement.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous transition to active nematic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active turbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are increasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to turbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through simulations of a minimal model of unbounded and defect-free active nematics, we find that the transition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition features a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and hysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\approx 4900$ of the dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find subcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar patterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic transients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence. Overall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in channel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background. We propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions of Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and thus render the transition discontinuous.</description>

      <title>The algebraic structure of the gradient expansion in linearised classical hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically treat the ambiguities that generically arise in the gradient expansion of any hydrodynamic theory. While these ambiguities do not affect the physical content of the equations, they induce two types of transformations in the space of transport coefficients. The first type is known as the 'frame' transformations, and amounts to field redefinitions. The second type, which we introduce and formalise here, we term the 'on-shell' transformations. This identifies equivalence classes of hydrodynamic theories that provide an equally valid low-energy description of the underlying microscopic theory. We show that in any (classical) theory of hydrodynamics (at arbitrary order in derivatives), the action of such transformations on the dispersion relations and two-point correlation functions is universal. We explicitly construct invariants which can then be matched to a microscopic theory. Among them are, expectedly, the low-momentum expansions of the hydrodynamic modes. The (unphysical) gapped modes can, however, be added or removed at will. Finally, we show that such transformations assign a nilpotent Lie group to every hydrodynamic theory, and discuss the related algebraic properties underlying classical hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Machine Learning of Lattice Boltzmann Collision Operators for Fluid Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We attempt the use of a unitary operator to approximate the lattice Boltzmann collision operator. We use a modified amplitude encoding to bypass the renormalization that would have required classical processing at every step (thus eroding any quantum advantage to be had). We describe the hard-wiring of the lattice Boltzmann symmetries into the quantum circuit and show that, for the specific case of the cavity flow, approximating the nonlinear system is limited to low velocities. These findings may help us understand better the possibilities of nonlinear simulations on a quantum computer, and also pave the way for a discussion on how quantum machine learning might be harnessed to address more complex problems.</description>
