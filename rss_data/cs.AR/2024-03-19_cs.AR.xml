      <title>System Support for Environmentally Sustainable Computing in Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern data centers suffer from a growing carbon footprint due to insufficient support for environmental sustainability. While hardware accelerators and renewable energy have been utilized to enhance sustainability, addressing Quality of Service (QoS) degradation caused by renewable energy supply and hardware recycling remains challenging: (1) prior accelerators exhibit significant carbon footprints due to limited reconfigurability and inability to adapt to renewable energy fluctuations; (2) integrating recycled NAND flash chips in data centers poses challenges due to their short lifetime, increasing energy consumption; (3) the absence of a sustainability estimator impedes data centers and users in evaluating and improving their environmental impact. This study aims to improve system support for environmentally sustainable data centers by proposing a reconfigurable hardware accelerator for intensive computing primitives and developing a fractional NAND flash cell to extend the lifetime of recycled flash chips while supporting graceful capacity degradation. We also introduce a sustainability estimator to evaluate user task energy consumption and promote sustainable practices. We present our preliminary results and recognize this as an ongoing initiative with significant potential to advance environmentally sustainable computing in data centers and stimulate further exploration in this critical research domain.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Emerging AI/ML Accelerators: IPU, RDU, and NVIDIA/AMD GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relentless advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications necessitates the development of specialized hardware accelerators capable of handling the increasing complexity and computational demands. Traditional computing architectures, based on the von Neumann model, are being outstripped by the requirements of contemporary AI/ML algorithms, leading to a surge in the creation of accelerators like the Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), Sambanova Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU), and enhanced GPU platforms. These hardware accelerators are characterized by their innovative data-flow architectures and other design optimizations that promise to deliver superior performance and energy efficiency for AI/ML tasks.
  This research provides a preliminary evaluation and comparison of these commercial AI/ML accelerators, delving into their hardware and software design features to discern their strengths and unique capabilities. By conducting a series of benchmark evaluations on common DNN operators and other AI/ML workloads, we aim to illuminate the advantages of data-flow architectures over conventional processor designs and offer insights into the performance trade-offs of each platform. The findings from our study will serve as a valuable reference for the design and performance expectations of research prototypes, thereby facilitating the development of next-generation hardware accelerators tailored for the ever-evolving landscape of AI/ML applications. Through this analysis, we aspire to contribute to the broader understanding of current accelerator technologies and to provide guidance for future innovations in the field.</description>
