      <title>TES Bolometer Design and Testing for the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment Millimeter Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers are a well-established technology with a strong track record in experimental cosmology, making them ideal for current and future radio astronomy instruments. The Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), in collaboration with JPL, has developed advanced silicon nitride leg isolated superconducting titanium detectors for 200 to 300 GHz observations of the Epoch of Reionization. Compared to their MHz counterparts, bolometers operating in this frequency range are less common because of their large absorber size and fragility. TIME aims to fabricate a total of 1920 high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) detectors to fully populate the focal plane. TIME has successfully developed HF (230 to 325 GHz) and LF (183 to 230 GHz) wafers that are physically robust and perform well at cryogenic temperatures (300 mK). Recent laboratory tests have shown high optical efficiencies for the LF wafers (30 to 40%), but low device yield for the HFs. To address this, new HF modules have been designed with improved cabling and a reduced backshort distance, and are expected to perform similarly to LFs in a similar lab setting. We report on the development of these detectors as well as recent laboratory and on sky tests conducted at the Arizona Radio Observatory's (ARO) 12 meter prototype antenna at Kitt Peak National Observatory.</description>

      <title>Optical Design Pathways to Fluidic Space-Assembled Reflectors &amp; Dual-Configuration Spectrographs for Characterizing Exo-Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textbf{Fluidic Telescopes}$ | We present a conceptual framework for optically designing space-assembled telescopes whose primary mirror is formed $\textit{in situ}$ via the enabling, scale-invariant technology of fluidic shaping. In-space assembly of optical reflectors can solve light-gathering aperture scaling, which currently limits space-borne optical telescopes. Our compass reduces the top-level optical design trade to three types of avenues---a fluidic pathway, a legacy one building upon the James Webb Space Telescope, and hybrid solutions---with a focus on exo-Earths. A primarily fluidic pathway leads, in the first place, to a post-prime-focus architecture. We apply this configuration to propose the tentative optical design for a ~1-m technology demonstrator and pathfinder for fluidic-telescope apertures scaling up to many tens of meters in diameter.
  $\textbf{Dual-Configuration Spectrographs}$ | The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be the first mission equipped for the high-contrast direct imaging and remote spectral characterization, in reflected starlight, of exo-Earths in our galactic neighborhood. We present a novel concept for a compact, dual-configuration HWO spectrograph tailored for a broad wavelength range covering at least 600--1000 nm. Our design can interchange dispersive elements via a slider mechanism while preserving the rest of the optical path, enabling both a spectral resolving power $R$~140 integral-field spectrograph and a single- or multi-object spectrograph with $R$ on the order of 10$^3$. Although $R$~140 is near-optimal for the $O_2$ absorption $A$-band around 760 nm, higher values of $R$ can be utilized with spectral cross-correlation matched-filter techniques to enhance, e.g., HWO's atmospheric characterization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Habitable World Discovery and Characterization: Coronagraph Concept of Operations and Data Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and characterization of habitable worlds was the top scientific recommendation of the Astro2020 decadal survey and is a key objective of the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Biosignature identification drives exceedingly challenging observations, which require raw contrasts of roughly 10$^{-10}$ contrast and ultimately, 1$\sigma$ photometric precision of roughly 3$\times 10^{-12}$ contrast. Despite significant advances for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's Coronagraph Instrument, technological gaps still exist in a wide range of technologies such as starlight suppression, deformable mirrors, wavefront control, low noise detectors, and high-contrast spectroscopy. Even with these new technologies matured, the Habitable Worlds Observatory must carefully obtain the observations and rely on post-processing of the data to achieve its science objectives.
  During the START and TAG efforts, a working group was convened to explore the Coronagraph Concept of Operations and Post Processing (COPP) in the context of the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This COPP working group evaluated coronagraphic concept of operations to enable different post processing approaches, such as reference differential imaging and angular differential imaging, polarization differential imaging, orbital differential imaging, coherent differential imaging, spectral processing, and point-spread function subtraction algorithms that incorporate ancillary telemetry and data. Future integrated modeling simulations and testbed demonstrations are needed to determine the achievable post processing gains for each approach. We report a summary of this working group's activities and findings, as well as an outlook for maturation of these techniques and infusion into the Habitable Worlds Observatory technology portfolio.</description>

      <title>The simulation chain for the Terzina Cherenkov telescope on board the NUSES space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Terzina telescope is designed to detect ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and Earth-skimming neutrinos from a 550 km low-Earth orbit (LEO) by observing Cherenkov light emitted by Extensive Air Showers (EAS) in the Earth's atmosphere pointing towards the telescope and in the field of view. In this contribution, a simulation chain for the Terzina telescope on board the NUSES mission will be presented. The chain encompasses all stages of the detection process, from event generation and EAS modelling with CORSIKA and EASCherSim to Geant4-based simulations of the telescope's geometry and optics, followed by modelling of the trigger system and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) response. The Geant4 module includes the real CAD model of the telescope structure and optical components, with aspherical lenses manually implemented to ensure accurate representation of the optical efficiency and point spread function in Geant4. This comprehensive pipeline, developed using modular C++ code and Python tools for event analysis and reconstruction, produces detailed performance assessments of a telescope operating in a LEO mission but can be adapted for any high altitude Cherenkov telescope, making it a versatile tool for future observatory designs. The possibility of modelling balloons in the atmosphere has also been developed.</description>

      <title>Accelerating cosmological simulations on GPUs: a portable approach using OpenMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present the porting to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs, using OpenMP target directives) and optimization of a key module within the cosmological {\pinocchio} code, a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT)-based framework widely used for generating dark matter (DM) halo catalogs. Our optimization focuses on a specific segment of the code responsible for calculating the collapse time of each particle involved in the simulation. Due to the embarrassingly parallel nature of this computation, it represents an ideal candidate for GPU offloading. As part of the porting process, we developed fully GPU-native implementations of both cubic spline and bilinear interpolation routines, required for evaluating collapse times. Since GNU Scientific Library (GSL) does not support GPU offloading, these custom implementations run entirely on the GPU and achieve residuals of only $\sim0.003\%$ when compared to the CPU-based implementation of GSL. Comparative benchmarking on the LEONARDO (NVIDIA-based) and SETONIX (AMD-based) supercomputers reveals notable portability and performance, with speedups of~\textit{4x} and up to~\textit{8x}, respectively. While collapse time calculation is not a primary bottleneck in the overall workflow, the acceleration reduces full production runs by $\sim 100$ seconds each leading to a cumulative saving of $\sim 160000$ Standard-h ($\sim28$ hours wall time) across thousands of simulations. Roofline analysis confirms that our GPU porting achieves over 80\% of the theoretical FP64 peak performance, confirming efficient compute-bound execution. This work demonstrates that OpenMP directives offer a portable, effective strategy for accelerating large-scale cosmological simulations on heterogeneous hardware.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Birks' coefficient of GAGG:Ce using hard X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inorganic scintillators continue to be widely used within astrophysical X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. This is in part thanks to the development of new scintillators, such as GAGG:Ce, as well as the availability of new scintillator readout sensors such as Silicon Photomultipliers and Silicon Drift Detectors. In order to use such scintillator materials for spectrometry or polarimetry, a detailed understanding of their response is important. One parameter that can affect the scintillator performance, particularly at lower photon energies, is their Birks' coefficienct, which correlates the relative light yield to the ionization energy. While for many high-Z inorganic scintillators this effect can be ignored, for GAGG:Ce this appears to not be the case. Here we provide a measurement of the Birks' coefficient for GAGG:Ce using data from two different detectors irradiated in the 20-80 keV energy range at the LARIX-A X-ray beam in Ferrara, Italy. While the effects due to Birks' law are visible below 30 keV, they also significantly influence the performance of GAGG:Ce performance near one of the K-edges, affecting both the measured gain and the energy resolution. Here, we use beam test data to derive the Birks' coefficient from GAGG:Ce. The results indicate that for usage in hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray missions, this coefficient has a significant effect on the measurements.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wavelength Dual-Polarized Lens-Absorber-Coupled Ti/Al Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents Ti/Al bi-layer Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) based on lens-coupled spiral absorbers as the quasi-optical coupling mechanism for millimeter-wavelength radiation detection. From simulations, the lens-coupled absorbers provide a 70% lens aperture efficiency in both polarizations over an octave band with a spiral array absorber and over 10% relative bandwidth with a single spiral. We have fabricated and measured two devices with bare Ti/Al MKIDs: a 3x3 cm chip with 9 pixels to characterize the optical response at 85 GHz of the two variations of the absorber; and a large format demonstrator with 253 spiral-array pixels showing potential towards a large format millimeter-wavelength camera. We find a sensitivity of 1 mK/sqrt{Hz} and a detector yield of 95%.</description>

      <title>Multi-faceted light pollution modelling and its application to the decline of artificial illuminance in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) has been increasing steadily over the past century, particularly during the last decade. This leads to rising light pollution, which is known to have adverse effects on living organisms, including humans. We present a new software package to model light pollution from ground radiance measurements. The software is called Otus 3 and incorporates innovative ALAN diffusion models with different atmospheric profiles, cloud covers and urban emission functions. To date, light pollution modelling typically focused on calculating the zenith luminance of the skyglow produced by city lights. In Otus 3 we extend this and additionally model the horizontal illuminance on the ground, including the contributions from skyglow and the direct illumination. We applied Otus 3 to France using ground radiance data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We calibrated our models using precise sky brightness measurements we obtained over 6 years at 139 different locations and make this dataset publicly available. We produced the first artificial illuminance map for France for the periods of 2013-2018 and 2019-2024. We found that the artificial ground illuminance in the middle of the night decreased by 23 % between these two periods, in stark contrast to the global trend.</description>

      <title>Focal-plane wavefront sensing with moderately broadband light using a short multi-mode fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a focal-plane wavefront sensor (FPWFS) based on a short multimode fiber (MMF) capable of operating under moderately broadband illumination. By coupling the aberrated focal-plane field into an MMF of length &lt;1 cm, we preserve modal interference over a 10 nm bandwidth at near-infrared wavelengths. The resulting output intensity pattern encodes pupil phase information, enabling wavefront recovery via a neural network. Our approach resolves the inherent sign ambiguity of even pupil-phase aberrations and operates on millisecond timescales using readily available computing hardware, suitable for real-time adaptive optics. Unlike traditional pupil-plane sensors, the proposed FPWFS shares the optical path with the science beam, eliminating non-common-path aberrations by enabling simultaneous wavefront and focal-plane intensity retrieval. Its simplicity, compactness, sensitivity, and low cost make it an attractive candidate for next-generation astronomical instruments.</description>

      <title>Advancing the Concept Maturity Level of the Servicing Architecture for Habitable Worlds Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advances the concept maturity level (CML) of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) servicing architecture. Since servicing has occurred on other missions, this paper argues that the current CML is 2. To advance to CML 3, option spaces must be established for trade studies. We introduce the three space ages and the argument that we are on the cusp of a new revolutionary era. Servicing is only part of that coming change and the other elements of the future space age are introduced. The challenge of designing a flagship mission such as HWO is discussed. The value proposition for the adoption of a new technology, such as servicing HWO, is established. In the latter portion of the paper it is shown that these elements have promise of being beneficial to HWO and should be included in any trade space.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning for costate initialization using Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions. We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a separate dedicated global search.</description>

      <title>microJAX: A Differentiable Framework for Microlensing Modeling with GPU-Accelerated Image-Centered Ray Shooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce microJAX, the first fully differentiable implementation of the image-centered ray-shooting (ICRS) algorithm for gravitational microlensing. Built on JAX and its XLA just-in-time compiler, microJAX exploits GPU parallelism while providing exact gradients through automatic differentiation. The current release supports binary- and triple-lens geometries, including limb-darkened extended-source effects, and delivers magnifications that remain differentiable for all model parameters. Benchmarks show that microJAX matches the accuracy of established packages and attains up to a factor of $\sim$5-6 speed-up in the small-source, limb-darkened regime on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Since the model is fully differentiable, it integrates seamlessly with probabilistic programming frameworks, enabling scalable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference workflows. Although the present work focuses on standard microlensing magnification models, the modular architecture is designed to support upcoming implementations of microlensing higher-order effects, while remaining compatible with external likelihood frameworks that incorporate advanced noise models. microJAX thus provides a robust foundation for precise and large-scale surveys anticipated in the coming decade, including the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, where scalable, physically self-consistent inference will be essential for maximizing scientific return.</description>

      <title>Medium-scale anisotropies measured by Telescope Array surface detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Telescope Array (TA) experiment, the largest observatory for ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the Northern Hemisphere, has identified two medium-scale anisotropies: the TA Hotspot near the constellation Ursa Major and an excess in the direction of the Perseus-Pisces supercluster. Studying these medium-scale anisotropies may provide insights into the origins of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. This presentation will explore an oversampling analysis of TA surface detector data to evaluate these medium-scale event excesses and will present the latest findings on the TA Hotspot and the Perseus-Pisces supercluster excess.</description>

      <title>Wide-field GMRT imaging of X-shaped Radio-Galaxies: Spectral properties of 4C32.25 and 4C61.23</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present wide-field upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) images of the fields around the X-shaped radio-galaxies (XRGs) 4C32.25, 4C61.23, and MRC 2011-298 obtained at 400 MHz. The observations are calibrated using the extreme peeling method to account for direction-dependent effects across the field of view, as previously applied to Low-frequency array (LOFAR) data. Our 400 MHz images capture in fine detail the radio-morphology of the XRGs, as well as other serendipitous radio-sources located in these fields. We use these images along with archival low-frequencyand high-frequency radio data to investigate the spectral properties of the XRGs 4C32.25 and 4C61.23. Under the assumption of conditions corresponding to the maximum radio-source age, we estimate the spectral ages of both the primary lobes and the wings. These ages indicate that the wings are the oldest component of the XRGs and are a product of past radio activity. Moreover, we have used the radio images available to derive high-resolution spectral index maps for these two XRGs. We find that the spectral index steepens from the primary lobes towards the wings, consistent with our spectral age estimates. These results suggest that precessional and backflow models explain the X-shaped radio-morphology of 4C32.25 and 4C61.23, respectively. Finally, taking advantage of our wide-area images, we identify several serendipitous diffuse radio-sources located in our XRG fields and cross-reference them with previous surveys.</description>

      <title>PINNGraPE: Physics Informed Neural Network for Gravitational wave Parameter Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly-modelled searches for gravitational waves are essential for ensuring that all potential sources are accounted for in detection efforts, as they make minimal assumptions regarding source morphology. While these searches primarily target generic transient sources, they are also highly effective at identifying a broad range of compact binary coalescences, demonstrated by the weakly-modelled search algorithm coherent WaveBurst being the first to detect GW150914. Despite their ability to detect compact binaries with diverse properties, the accurate estimation of source parameters from their output remains to be a challenging task. To overcome this, we leverage physics-informed neural networks, which serve as a powerful tool for parameter estimation by applying physical constraints through the universal differential equation governing a compact binary system. With this approach, we rapidly infer the mass parameters of binary black hole merger systems to within 7% from only the time-frequency representation of the gravitational wave signal.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-based reconstruction of muon lateral distribution function using combined integrator and binary detector modes</title>

Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, with energies $E \geq 10^{18}$ eV, remains unknown. Among the key observables used to investigate their nature are the energy spectrum, the arrival direction distribution, and the composition as a function of energy. The composition of the primary cosmic ray is inferred from properties of the extensive air showers they initiate, particularly from parameters sensitive to the primary mass. The most sensitive parameters to the primary mass are the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, typically measured with fluorescence telescopes, and the muon content of the shower, measured using dedicated muon detectors. A commonly used observable in composition studies is the muon density at a fixed distance from the shower axis, derived by evaluating the reconstructed muon lateral distribution function (MLDF) at a reference distance. A specific type of muon detector features two acquisition modes: binary and integrator (commonly referred to as ADC mode, for Analog-to-Digital Converter). The binary mode allows for direct muon counting, while the ADC mode infers the muon number from the integrated signal of the detector response. Existing methods reconstruct the MLDF using data from either acquisition mode individually, or by combining both, but usually assigning a single mode per detector station in a given event. This work presents a novel method to reconstruct the MLDF based on a likelihood approach that simultaneously incorporates data from both acquisition modes at each detector station. We apply our method to the underground muon detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study. However, this general approach can be applied to future detectors with dual acquisition capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the combined method outperforms traditional techniques that rely solely on either binary or ADC mode data.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation with Autoregressive Tiling for Detecting Objects in Astronomical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming astronomical surveys will produce petabytes of high-resolution images of the night sky, providing information about billions of stars and galaxies. Detecting and characterizing the astronomical objects in these images is a fundamental task in astronomy -- and a challenging one, as most of these objects are faint and many visually overlap with other objects. We propose an amortized variational inference procedure to solve this instance of small-object detection. Our key innovation is a family of spatially autoregressive variational distributions that partition and order the latent space according to a $K$-color checkerboard pattern. By construction, the conditional independencies of this variational family mirror those of the posterior distribution. We fit the variational distribution, which is parameterized by a convolutional neural network, using neural posterior estimation (NPE) to minimize an expectation of the forward KL divergence. Using images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate that the proposed autoregressive structure greatly improves posterior calibration.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Mapping with Ariel: Future Prospects for a Population-Level Mapping Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eclipse mapping is a powerful tool for measuring 3D profiles of exoplanet atmospheres. To date, only JWST has been capable of widely applying this technique, but as a general observatory, it is too time-limited to conduct population-level mapping studies. Ariel, on the other hand, is a dedicated exoplanet mission set to observe 1000 transiting exoplanets, making it a natural candidate for this. To assess Ariel's mapping potential, we quantitatively benchmark its abilities against those of JWST using a simulation-and-retrieval framework with existing JWST eclipse maps as test cases. We find that for high-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to derive qualitatively similar maps to JWST using the same amount of observations; for mid-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to compete using as few as 3x as many observations; and for lower-ranking targets, the use of phase curves overcomes the need for an impractical number of repeated eclipse observations. We find that while Ariel is unlikely to have extensive latitudinal mapping abilities, it will have wide-ranging longitudinal abilities, from which the first-order atmospheric dynamics can be constrained. Using an analytically-derived metric, we determine the best eclipse mapping targets for Ariel, finding that it will be able to map nearly 100 targets using full phase curves in only quarter of its lifetime. This would be the largest mapping survey to date, and have enormous ramifications for our understanding of exoplanet atmospheric dynamics. Finally, we rank all the best mapping targets for both JWST and Ariel in order to encourage future eclipse mapping studies.</description>

      <title>An Open-Access Web Tool for Light Curve Simulation and Analysis of Small Solar System Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a web-based application designed to simulate rotational light curves of small airless Solar System bodies under user-defined geometrical and physical conditions. The tool integrates both physical and empirical photometric models and enables users to input custom shape models, surface properties, and viewing geometries. A dedicated module also computes projected silhouettes at the epoch of stellar occultations, allowing direct comparison with observed chords. The application, developed in Python and Django, has been validated using well-characterized targets such as (136108) Haumea, (101955) Bennu, and (433) Eros, showing excellent agreement between synthetic and observed light curves and silhouettes. Beyond standard light curve simulations, the tool supports scenarios including surface heterogeneity, non-principal axis rotation (tumbling), and phase-angle effects. This flexible and accessible platform provides a powerful resource for interpreting photometric data, supporting ongoing observation campaigns, and aiding future mission planning.</description>

      <title>Millisecond Cadence Radio Frequency Interference Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) greatly reduces sensitivity of radio observations to astrophysical signals and creates false positive candidates in searches for radio transients. Real signals are missed while considerable computational and human resources are needed to remove RFI candidates. Effective RFI removal is vital to carry out successful searches for fast radio bursts and pulsars. Mitigation techniques that excise RFI on short timescales account for a changing radio frequency and pulse environments. We evaluate the effectiveness of three filters, as well as a novel composite of the three, that excises RFI at the cadence that the data is recorded. Each of these filters operates in a different domain and thus excises as a different RFI morphology. The composite filter removes RFI not accessible to other filtering methods. We analyze the performance of these four filters in three different situations: (i) synthetic pulses in Gaussian noise; (ii) synthetic pulses injected into observed spectra; (iii) test observations of four pulsars. From these tests, we gain insight into how the filters affect both the pulse and the noise level. This allows us to outline which and how the filters should be used based on the RFI present and the characteristics of the source signal. These filters both increase sensitivity and reduce the number of false positives. By flagging less than 5% of the spectrum, we demonstrate a 53% increase in detected pulses and 34% decrease in the number of RFI candidates relative to the Heimdall-Fetch-Your search pipeline.</description>

      <title>A novel inversion algorithm for weak gravitational lensing using quasi-conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge in weak gravitational lensing caused by galaxies and clusters is to infer the projected mass density distribution from gravitational lensing measurements, known as the inversion problem. We introduce a novel theoretical approach to solving the inversion problem. The cornerstone of the proposed method lies in a complex formalism that describes the lens mapping as a quasi-conformal mapping with the Beltrami coefficient given by the negative of the reduced shear, which can, in principle, be observed from the image ellipticities. We propose an algorithm called QCLens that is based on this complex formalism. QCLens computes the underlying quasi-conformal mapping using a finite element approach by reducing the problem to two elliptic partial differential equations that solely depend on the reduced shear field. Experimental results for both the Schwarzschild and the singular isothermal lens demonstrate the agreement of our proposed method with the analytically computable solutions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.</description>

      <title>Application of Non-Linear Noise Regression in the Virgo Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06220v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first demonstration of non-linear noise regression in the Virgo detector using deep learning techniques. We use DeepClean, a convolutional autoencoder previously shown to be effective in denoising LIGO data, as our tool for modeling and subtracting environmental and technical noise in Virgo. The method uses auxiliary witness channels to learn correlated noise features and remove them from the strain data. For this study, we apply DeepClean to Virgo O3b data, using 225 witness channels selected across 13 targeted frequency bands. Our analysis confirms the presence of non-linear couplings in the subtracted noise, highlighting the importance of DeepClean-like tools in capturing such effects. We observe up to a 1.3 Mpc improvement in the binary neutron star inspiral range (~2.5% gain), and an average increase of 1.7% in the recovered signal-to-noise ratio for injected binary black hole signals. Parameter estimation studies further confirm that DeepClean does not introduce bias in the recovery of source parameters. These results demonstrate the robustness of DeepClean on Virgo data and support its adoption in real-time noise subtraction frameworks for future observing runs.</description>

Abstract: This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of weak gravitational lensing and its current applications in cosmology. We begin by introducing the fundamental concepts of gravitational lensing and derive the key equations for the deflection angle, lensing potential, convergence, and shear. We explore how weak lensing can be used as a cosmological probe, discussing cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and their combination with galaxy clustering in the 3$\times$2pt analysis. The chapter covers the theoretical framework for modeling lensing observables, shear estimation techniques, and major systematic effects such as intrinsic alignments and baryonic feedback. We review the current results of weak lensing cosmology from major surveys and outline prospects for future advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set: Improved Timing Precision With VLBI Astrometric Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate pulsar astrometric estimates play an essential role in almost all high-precision pulsar timing experiments. Traditional pulsar timing techniques refine these estimates by including them as free parameters when fitting a model to observed pulse time-of-arrival measurements. However, reliable sub-milliarcsecond astrometric estimations require years of observations and, even then, power from red noise can be inadvertently absorbed into astrometric parameter fits, biasing the resulting estimations and reducing our sensitivity to red noise processes, including gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we seek to mitigate these shortcomings by using pulsar astrometric estimates derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as priors for the timing fit. First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the reference frames used in VLBI and timing. Then, we used the VLBI-informed priors and timing-based likelihoods of several astrometric solutions consistent with both techniques to obtain a maximum-posterior astrometric solution. We found offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions, which, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of interest for single-source GW searches. However, we do not find significant power absorption due to astrometric fitting at the low-frequency domain of the GW background.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, offering insights into stellar collapse, extreme matter behavior, and cosmic evolution. The advent of multi-messenger astronomy, combining electromagnetic, gravitational wave, and neutrino observations, alongside advances in high-energy polarimetry, is revolutionizing GRB research, enabling deeper exploration of their physical mechanisms.
  This manuscript summarizes how upcoming and proposed space-based missions will tackle key challenges in GRB science, focusing on four areas: (i) identifying high-redshift GRBs to probe the early universe, (ii) enhancing multi-messenger detection and localization, (iii) improving multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB afterglows, and (iv) studying prompt emission polarization to understand jet dynamics and magnetic fields. Highlighting planned missions and their advancements, this work provides a snapshot of current GRB research frontiers, with updates on the evolving status of these missions.</description>
