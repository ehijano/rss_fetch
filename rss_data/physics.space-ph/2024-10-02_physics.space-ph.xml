      <title>On Energization and Loss of the Ionized Heavy Atom and Molecule in Mars' Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of global magnetic fields is often cited to explain why Mars lacks a dense atmosphere. This line of thought is based on a prevailing theory that magnetic fields can shield the atmosphere from solar wind erosion. However, we present observations here to demonstrate a counterintuitive understanding: unlike the global intrinsic magnetic field, the remnant crustal magnetic fields can enhance atmosphere loss when considering loss induced by plasma wave-particle interactions. An analysis of MAVEN data, combined with observation-based simulations, reveals that the bulk of O+ ions would be in resonance with ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves when the latter were present. This interaction then results in significant particle energization, thus enhancing ion escaping. A more detailed analysis attributes the occurrence of the resonance to the presence of Mars' crustal magnetic fields, which cause the majority of nearby ions to gyrate at a frequency matching the resonant condition ({\omega}-k_{\parallel} v_{\parallel}={\Omega}_i) of the waves. The ULF waves, fundamental drivers of this entire process, are excited and propelled by the upstream solar wind. Consequently, our findings offer a plausible explanation for the mysterious changes in Mars' climate, suggesting that the ancient solar wind imparted substantially more energy.</description>

      <title>Deriving the interaction point between a Coronal Mass Ejection and High Speed Stream: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the interaction between an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) detected in situ at the L1 Lagrange point on 2016 October 12 with a trailing High-Speed Stream (HSS). We aim to estimate the region in the interplanetary (IP) space where the interaction happened/started using a combined observational-modeling approach. We use Minimum Variance Analysis and the Walen test to analyze possible reconnection exhaust at the interface of ICME and HSS. We perform a Graduated Cylindrical Shell reconstruction of the CME to estimate the geometry and source location of the CME. Finally, we use a two-step Drag Based Model (DBM) model to estimate the region in IP space where the interaction took place. The magnetic obstacle (MO) observed in situ shows a fairly symmetric and undisturbed structure and shows the magnetic flux, helicity, and expansion profile/speed of a typical ICME. The MVA together with the Walen test, however, confirms reconnection exhaust at the ICME HSS boundary. Thus, in situ signatures are in favor of a scenario where the interaction is fairly recent. The trailing HSS shows a distinct velocity profile which first reaches a semi-saturated plateau with an average velocity of 500 km/s and then saturates at a maximum speed of 710 km/s . We find that the HSS interaction with the ICME is influenced only by this initial plateau. The results of the two-step DBM suggest that the ICME has started interacting with the HSS close to Earth (approx 0.81 au), which compares well with the deductions from in situ signatures.</description>
