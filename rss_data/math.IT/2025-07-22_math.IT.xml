      <title>Information Theoretic Analysis of a Dual-Band MIMO Cellphone Antenna with ANSYS HFSS SBR+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, the design of antenna arrays has evolved separately from Shannon theory. Shannon theory adopts a probabilistic approach in the design of communication systems, while antenna design approaches have relied on the deterministic Maxwell theory alone. In this paper, we investigate an information-theoretic analysis approach which we apply to evaluate the design of a dual-band, dual-polarized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array on a cellphone. To this end, we use ANSYS HFSS, a commercial electromagnetic (EM) simulation software suitable for the numerical optimization of antenna systems. HFSS is used to obtain an accurate model of the cellphone MIMO antenna array and HFSS SBR+ is utilized to obtain channel matrices for a large number of users. Taking advantage of linear and optimal processing at the cellphone, we estimate the outage probability curves. The curves are then used to determine the diversity gain in a moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and the multiplexing gain at a high SNR regime. This approach is then compared with the method of estimating the diversity gain from the envelope correlation coefficients or the beam-coupling matrix showing substantial differences in the two methodologies.</description>

      <title>Study of Delay-Calibrated Joint User Activity Detection, Channel Estimation and Data Detection for Asynchronous mMTC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers uplink asynchronous massive machine-type communications, where a large number of low-power and low-cost devices asynchronously transmit short packets to an access point equipped with multiple receive antennas. If orthogonal preambles are employed, massive collisions will occur due to the limited number of orthogonal preambles given the preamble sequence length. To address this problem, we propose a delay-calibrated joint user activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection algorithm, and investigate the benefits of oversampling in estimating continuous-valued time delays at the receiver. The proposed algorithm is based on the expectation-maximization method, which alternately estimates the delays and detects active users and their channels and data by noting that the collided users have different delays. Under the Bayesian inference framework, we develop a computationally efficient iterative algorithm using the approximate message passing principle to resolve the joint user activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of the normalized mean-squared errors of channel and data symbols, and the probability of misdetection.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Intersectional Data Valuation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary digital markets, personal data often reveals not just isolated traits, but complex, intersectional identities based on combinations of race, gender, disability, and other protected characteristics. This exposure generates a privacy externality: firms benefit economically from profiling, prediction, and personalization, while users face hidden costs in the form of social risk and discrimination. We introduce a formal pricing rule that quantifies and internalizes this intersectional privacy loss using mutual information, assigning monetary value to the entropy reduction induced by each datum. The result is a Pigouvian-style surcharge that discourages harmful data trades and rewards transparency. Our formulation has the advantage that it operates independently of the underlying statistical model of the intersectional variables, be it parametric, nonparametric, or learned, and can be approximated in practice by discretizing the intersectional joint probability distributions. We illustrate how regulators can calibrate this surcharge to reflect different societal values, and argue that it provides not just a technical fix to market failures, but also a redistributive shield that empowers vulnerable groups in the face of asymmetric digital power.</description>

      <title>Collusion-Resilient Hierarchical Secure Aggregation with Heterogeneous Security Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by federated learning (FL), secure aggregation (SA) aims to securely compute, as efficiently as possible, the sum of a set of inputs distributed across many users. To understand the impact of network topology, hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) investigated the communication and secret key generation efficiency in a 3-layer relay network, where clusters of users are connected to the aggregation server through an intermediate layer of relays. Due to the pre-aggregation of the messages at the relays, HSA reduces the communication burden on the relay-to-server links and is able to support a large number of users. However, as the number of users increases, a practical challenge arises from heterogeneous security requirements--for example, users in different clusters may require varying levels of input protection. Motivated by this, we study weakly-secure HSA (WS-HSA) with collusion resilience, where instead of protecting all the inputs from any set of colluding users, only the inputs belonging to a predefined collection of user groups (referred to as security input sets) need to be protected against another predefined collection of user groups (referred to as collusion sets). Since the security input sets and collusion sets can be arbitrarily defined, our formulation offers a flexible framework for addressing heterogeneous security requirements in HSA. We characterize the optimal total key rate, i.e., the total number of independent key symbols required to ensure both server and relay security, for a broad range of parameter configurations. For the remaining cases, we establish lower and upper bounds on the optimal key rate, providing constant-factor gap optimality guarantees.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Resilience Against Jamming Attacks: A Cooperative Anti-Jamming Method Using Direction Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent vulnerability of wireless communication necessitates strategies to enhance its security, particularly in the face of jamming attacks. This paper uses the collaborations of multiple sensing nodes (SNs) in the wireless network to present a cooperative anti-jamming approach (CAJ) designed to neutralize the impact of jamming attacks. We propose an eigenvector (EV) method to estimate the direction of the channel vector from pilot symbols. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that with an adequate number of pilot symbols, the performance of the proposed EV method is comparable to the scenario where the perfect channel state information (CSI) is utilized. Both analytical formulas and simulations illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed EV-CAJ under strong jamming signals. Considering severe jamming, the proposed EV-CAJ method exhibits only a 0.7 dB degradation compared to the case without jamming especially when the number of SNs is significantly larger than the number of jamming nodes (JNs). Moreover, the extension of the proposed method can handle multiple jammers at the expense of degrees of freedom (DoF). We also investigate the method's ability to remain robust in fast-fading channels with different coherence times. Our proposed approach demonstrates good resilience, particularly when the ratio of the channel's coherence time to the time frame is small. This is especially important in the case of mobile jammers with large Doppler shifts.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Communications and Sensing Simultaneously by Zero-Order Optimization of MTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface (MTS) comprises an array of metaatoms, each reflecting and inducing a phase shift into the incident wireless signal. We seek the optimal combination of phase shifts across all the meta-atoms to maximize the channel strength from transmitter to receiver. Unlike many existing works that heavily rely on channel state information (CSI), this paper proposes a statistical approach to the phase shift optimization in the absence of CSI, namely blind configuration or zero-order optimization. The main idea is to extract the key features of the wireless environment from the received signal strength (RSS) data via conditional sample mean, with provable performance. Furthermore, as a windfall profit, we show that the proposed blind configuration method has a nontrivial connection to phase retrieval which can be utilized for active sensing. In a nutshell, by configuring a pair of MTSs blindly without channel estimation, we not only enhance the channel strength to facilitate wireless communication, but also enable receiver to localize transmitter. All we need is the RSS data that can be readily measured at receiver. Our algorithm is verified in prototype systems in the 2.6 GHz spectral band. As shown in field tests, the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks (e.g., MUSIC) in the active sensing task, and in the meanwhile raises the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly by about 10 dB.</description>

      <title>A DPI-PAC-Bayesian Framework for Generalization Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14795v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified Data Processing Inequality PAC-Bayesian framework -- abbreviated DPI-PAC-Bayesian -- for deriving generalization error bounds in the supervised learning setting. By embedding the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) into the change-of-measure technique, we obtain explicit bounds on the binary Kullback-Leibler generalization gap for both R\'enyi divergence and any $f$-divergence measured between a data-independent prior distribution and an algorithm-dependent posterior distribution. We present three bounds derived under our framework using R\'enyi, Hellinger \(p\) and Chi-Squared divergences. Additionally, our framework also demonstrates a close connection with other well-known bounds. When the prior distribution is chosen to be uniform, our bounds recover the classical Occam's Razor bound and, crucially, eliminate the extraneous \(\log(2\sqrt{n})/n\) slack present in the PAC-Bayes bound, thereby achieving tighter results. The framework thus bridges data-processing and PAC-Bayesian perspectives, providing a flexible, information-theoretic tool to construct generalization guarantees.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion-Perception Trade-off with Strong Realism Constraints: Role of Side Information and Common Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In image compression, with recent advances in generative modeling, existence of a trade-off between the rate and perceptual quality has been brought to light, where the perceptual quality is measured by the closeness of the output and source distributions. We consider the compression of a memoryless source sequence $X^n=(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ in the presence of memoryless side information $Z^n=(Z_1, \ldots, Z_n),$ originally studied by Wyner and Ziv, but elucidate the impact of a strong perfect realism constraint, which requires the joint distribution of output symbols $Y^n=(Y_1,...,Y_n)$ to match the distribution of the source sequence. We consider two cases: when $Z^n$ is available only at the decoder, or at both the encoder and decoder, and characterize the information theoretic limits under various scenarios. Previous works show the superiority of randomized codes under strong perceptual quality constraints. When $Z^n$ is available at both terminals, we characterize its dual role, as a source of common randomness, and as a second look on the source for the receiver. We also study different notions of strong perfect realism which we call marginal realism, joint realism and near-perfect realism. We derive explicit solutions when $X$ and $Z$ are jointly Gaussian under the squared error distortion measure. In traditional lossy compression, having $Z$ only at the decoder imposes no rate penalty in the Gaussian scenario. We show that, when strong perfect realism constraints are imposed this holds only when sufficient common randomness is available.</description>

      <title>Variable Min-Cut Max-Flow Bounds and Algorithms in Finite Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum achievable capacity from source to destination in a network is limited by the min-cut max-flow bound; this serves as a converse limit. In practice, link capacities often fluctuate due to dynamic network conditions. In this work, we introduce a novel analytical framework that leverages tools from computational geometry to analyze throughput in heterogeneous networks with variable link capacities in a finite regime. Within this model, we derive new performance bounds and demonstrate that increasing the number of links can reduce throughput variability by nearly $90\%$. We formally define a notion of network stability and show that an unstable graph can have an exponential number of different min-cut sets, up to $O(2^{|E|})$. To address this complexity, we propose an algorithm that enforces stability with time complexity $O(|E|^2 + |V|)$, and further suggest mitigating the delay-throughput tradeoff using adaptive rateless random linear network coding (AR-RLNC).</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays With Tunable Loads: Expanding Solution Space via Coupling Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging reconfigurable antenna (RA) array technology promises capacity enhancement through dynamic antenna positioning. Traditional approaches enforce half-wavelength or greater spacing among RA elements to avoid mutual coupling, limiting the solution space. Additionally, achieving sufficient spatial channel sampling requires numerous discrete RA positions (ports), while high-frequency scenarios with hybrid processing demand many physical RAs to maintain array gains. This leads to exponential growth in the solution space. We propose two techniques to address the former challenge: (1) surrounding a limited number of active RAs with passive ones terminated to tunable analog loads to \textit{exploit} mutual coupling and increase array gain, and (2) employing tunable loads on each RA in an all-active design to \textit{eliminate} mutual coupling in the analog domain. Both methods enable arbitrary RA spacing, unlocking the full solution space. Regarding the latter challenge, we develop greedy and meta-heuristic port selection algorithms, alongside low-complexity heuristic variants, that efficiently handle over $10^{20}$ array configurations, and optimize the loading values to maximize the sum-rate in a multiple-input single-output broadcast channel under transmission power constraints, assuming a heuristic linear precoder. Furthermore, we analyze performance degradation from quantized loads and propose corresponding robust designs. Numerical simulations reveal significant performance gains over benchmarks and provide valuable insights.</description>

      <title>Noise Quantification and Control in Circuits via Strong Data-Processing Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay explores strong data-processing inequalities (SPDI's) as they appear in the work of Evans and Schulman \cite{ES} and von Neumann \cite{vN} on computing with noisy circuits. We first develop the framework in \cite{ES}, which leads to lower bounds on depth and upper bounds on noise that permit reliable computation. We then introduce the $3$-majority gate, introduced by \cite{vN} for the purpose of controlling noise, and obtain an upper bound on noise necessary for its function. We end by generalizing von Neumann's analysis to majority gates of any order, proving an analogous noise threshold and giving a sufficient upper bound for order given a desired level of reliability.
  The presentation of material has been modified in a way deemed more natural by the author, occasionally leading to simplifications of existing proofs. Furthermore, many computations omitted from the original works have been worked out, and some new commentary added. The intended audience has a rudimentary understanding of information theory similar to that of the author.</description>

      <title>The Exact Parameters of A Family of BCH Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the theoretical and practical significance of BCH codes, the exact minimum distance and dimension remain unknown for many families. This paper establishes the precise minimum distance and dimension of narrow-sense BCH codes $\C_{(q, m, \lambda, \ell_0, \ell_1)}$ over $\gf(q)$ of length $\frac{q^m-1}{\lambda}$ and designed distance $\frac{(q-\lambda \ell_0)q^{m-1-\ell_1}-1}{\lambda}$, where $\lambda\mid (q-1)$, $0\leq \ell_0&lt; \frac{q-1}{\lambda}$, and $0\leq \ell_1\leq m-1$. These results conclusively resolve the three open problems posed by Li et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 63, no. 11, pp. 7219-7236, Nov. 2017) while establishing complementary advances to Ding's seminal framework (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 61, no. 10, pp. 5322-5330, Oct. 2015).</description>

      <title>A Novel Two-Dimensional Smoothing Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smoothing and filtering two-dimensional sequences are fundamental tasks in fields such as computer vision. Conventional filtering algorithms often rely on the selection of the filtering window, limiting their applicability in certain scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel Two-Dimensional Smoothing (TDS) algorithm for the smoothing and filtering problem of two-dimensional sequences. Typically, the TDS algorithm does not require assumptions about the type of noise distribution. It is simple and easy to implement compared to conventional filtering methods, such as 2D adaptive Wiener filtering and Gaussian filtering. The TDS algorithm can effectively extract the trend contained in the two-dimensional sequence and reduce the influence of noise on the data by adjusting only a single parameter. In this work, unlike existing algorithms that depend on the filtering window, we introduce a loss function, where the trend sequence is identified as the solution when this loss function takes a minimum value. Therefore, within the framework of the TDS algorithm, a general two-dimensional sequence can be innovatively decomposed into a trend sequence and a fluctuation sequence, in which the trend sequence contains the main features of the sequence and the fluctuation sequence contains the detailed features or noise interference of the sequence. To ensure the reliability of the TDS algorithm, a crucial lemma is first established, indicating that the trend sequence and fluctuation sequence obtained by the TDS algorithm are existent and unique when the global smoothing parameter is determined. Three modified algorithms are then proposed based on the TDS algorithm, with corresponding lemmas and corollaries demonstrating their reliability. Finally, the accuracy and effectiveness of the TDS algorithm are further verified through numerical simulations and image processing cases.</description>

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a useful information-theoretic measure to quantify the statistical dependence between two random variables: $X$ and $Y$. Often, we are interested in understanding how the dependence between $X$ and $Y$ in one set of samples compares to another. Although the dependence between $X$ and $Y$ in each set of samples can be measured separately using MI, these estimates cannot be compared directly if they are based on samples from a non-stationary distribution. Here, we propose an alternative measure for characterising how the dependence between $X$ and $Y$ as defined by one set of samples is expressed in another, \textit{cross mutual information}. We present a comprehensive set of simulation studies sampling data with $X$-$Y$ dependencies to explore this measure. Finally, we discuss how this relates to measures of model fit in linear regression, and some future applications in neuroimaging data analysis.</description>

      <title>Galois equiangular tight frames from Galois self-dual codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greaves et al. (2022) extended frames over real or complex numbers to frames over finite fields. In this paper, we study the theory of frames over finite fields by incorporating the Galois inner products introduced by Fan and Zhang (2017), which generalize the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products. We define a class of frames, called Galois frames over finite fields, along with related notions such as Galois Gram matrices, Galois frame operators, and Galois equiangular tight frames (Galois ETFs). We also characterize when Galois self-dual codes induce Galois ETFs. Furthermore, we construct explicitly Galois ETFs from Galois self-dual constacyclic codes.</description>

      <title>Estimating Rate-Distortion Functions Using the Energy-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate-distortion (RD) theory is one of the key concepts in information theory, providing theoretical limits for compression performance and guiding the source coding design, with both theoretical and practical significance. The Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, as a classical algorithm to compute RD functions, encounters computational challenges when applied to high-dimensional scenarios. In recent years, many neural methods have attempted to compute high-dimensional RD problems from the perspective of implicit generative models. Nevertheless, these approaches often neglect the reconstruction of the optimal conditional distribution or rely on unreasonable prior assumptions. In face of these issues, we propose an innovative energy-based modeling framework that leverages the connection between the RD dual form and the free energy in statistical physics, achieving effective reconstruction of the optimal conditional distribution.The proposed algorithm requires training only a single neural network and circumvents the challenge of computing the normalization factor in energy-based models using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Experimental results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimating high-dimensional RD functions and reconstructing the optimal conditional distribution.</description>

      <title>Remote Channel Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of synthesizing a memoryless channel between an unobserved source and a remote terminal. An encoder has access to a partial or noisy version $Z^n = (Z_1, \ldots, Z_n)$ of a remote source sequence $X^n = (X_1, \ldots, X_n),$ with $(X_i,Z_i)$ independent and identically distributed with joint distribution $q_{X,Z}.$ The encoder communicates through a noiseless link to a decoder which aims to produce an output $Y^n$ coordinated with the remote source; that is, the total variation distance between the joint distribution of $X^n$ and $Y^n$ and some i.i.d. target distribution $q_{X,Y}^{\otimes n}$ is required to vanish as $n$ goes to infinity. The two terminals may have access to a source of rate-limited common randomness. We present a single-letter characterization of the optimal compression and common randomness rates. We also show that when the common randomness rate is small, then in most cases, coordinating $Z^n$ and $Y^n$ using a standard channel synthesis scheme is strictly sub-optimal. In other words, schemes for which the joint distribution of $Z^n$ and $Y^n$ approaches a product distribution asymptotically are strictly sub-optimal.</description>

      <title>The Capacity of Semantic Private Information Retrieval with Colluding Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of semantic private information retrieval (Sem-PIR) with $T$ colluding servers (Sem-TPIR), i.e., servers that collectively share user queries. In Sem-TPIR, the message sizes are different, and message retrieval probabilities by any user are not uniform. This is a generalization of the classical PIR problem where the message sizes are equal and message retrieval probabilities are identical. The earlier work on Sem-PIR considered the case of no collusions, i.e., the collusion parameter of $T=1$. In this paper, we consider the general problem for arbitrary $T &lt; N$. We find an upper bound on the retrieval rate and design a scheme that achieves this rate, i.e., we derive the exact capacity of Sem-TPIR.</description>

      <title>Visible Light Indoor Positioning with a Single LED and Distributed Single-Element OIRS: An Iterative Approach with Adaptive Beam Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Optical Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (OIRSs) into Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems is gaining momentum as a valid alternative to RF technologies, harnessing the existing lighting infrastructures and the vast unlicensed optical spectrum to enable higher spectral efficiency, improved resilience to Line-of-Sight (LoS) blockages, and enhanced positioning capabilities. This paper investigates the problem of localizing a low-cost Photo Detector (PD) in a VLC-based indoor environment consisting of only a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) as an active anchor, and multiple spatially distributed single-element OIRSs. We formulate the problem within an indirect, computationally efficient localization framework: first, the optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators of the LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) distances are derived, using a suitable OIRS activation strategy to prevent interferences. To overcome the grid-based optimization required by the ML NLoS estimator, we devise a novel algorithm based on an unstructured noise variance transformation, which admits a closed-form solution. The set of estimated LoS/NLoS distances are then used within a low-complexity localization algorithm combining an Iterative Weighted Least Squares (IWLS) procedure, whose weights are set according to the inverse of the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), with an adaptive beam steering strategy that allows the OIRSs network to dynamically align with the PD, without any prior knowledge of its position. Accordingly, we derive the CRLB for both LoS/NLoS distance estimation and PD position estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of localization accuracy, robustness against OIRSs misalignment conditions, and low number of iterations required to attain the theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Extreme Value Theory-based Distributed Interference Prediction for 6G Industrial Sub-networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interference prediction that accounts for extreme and rare events remains a key challenge for ultra-densely deployed sub-networks (SNs) requiring hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC), particularly under dynamic mobility, rapidly varying channel statistics, and sporadic traffic. This paper proposes a novel calibrated interference tail prediction framework, a hybrid statistical and machine learning (ML) approach that integrates an inverted quantile patch transformer (iQPTransformer) within extreme value theory (EVT). It captures interference dynamics and tail behavior while quantifying uncertainty to provide statistical coverage guarantees. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by leveraging the estimated interference tail distribution to design predictive, risk-aware resource allocation. In resource-constrained SN scenarios, we introduce the split-iQPTransformer, enabling collaborative training by distributing neural network components between sensor-actuator (SA) pairs and the SN controller, while maintaining minimal performance disparity compared to the centralized iQPTransformer. The framework effectively handles deep fading, random traffic, and time-division duplexing (TDD) misalignments and is resilient to rare and extreme interference events. Extensive evaluations are performed under two mobility models and two realistic SN traffic patterns, using a spatially consistent 3GPP channel model across all scenarios. Experimental results show consistent achievement of block error rate (BLER) targets beyond the 95th percentile in the hyper-reliable regime, significantly outperforming baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>CQI-Based Interference Prediction for Link Adaptation in Industrial Sub-networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel interference prediction scheme to improve link adaptation (LA) in densely deployed industrial sub-networks (SNs) with high-reliability and low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements. The proposed method aims to improve the LA framework by predicting and leveraging the heavy-tailed interference probability density function (pdf). Interference is modeled as a latent vector of available channel quality indicator (CQI), using a vector discrete-time state-space model (vDSSM) at the SN controller, where the CQI is subjected to compression, quantization, and delay-induced errors. To robustly estimate interference power values under these impairments, we employ a low-complexity, outlier-robust, sparse Student-t process regression (SPTPR) method. This is integrated into a modified unscented Kalman filter, which recursively refines predicted interference using CQI, enabling accurate estimation and compensating protocol feedback delays, crucial for accurate LA. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves over 10x lower complexity compared to a similar non-parametric baseline. It also maintains a BLER below the 90th percentile target of 1e-6 while delivering performance comparable to a state-of-the-art supervised technique using only CQI reports.</description>

Abstract: We introduce DM-RSA (Dual Modulus RSA), a variant of the RSA cryptosystem that employs two distinct moduli symmetrically to enhance security. By leveraging the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for decryption, DM-RSA provides increased robustness against side-channel attacks while preserving the efficiency of classical RSA. This approach improves resistance to partial compromise of a modulus and integrates easily into existing infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Design of A New Multiple-Chirp-Rate Index Modulation for LoRa Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multiple chirp rate index modulation (MCR-IM) system based on Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences that overcomes the problems of low transmission rate and large-scale access in classical LoRa networks. We demonstrate the extremely low cross-correlation of MCR-IM signals across different spread factors, showing that the proposed MCR-IM system also inherits the characteristics of ZC sequences modulation. Moreover, we derive an approximate closed-form expression for the bit-error rate (BER) of the proposed MCR-IM system over Nakagami-m fading channels. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived closed-form expression and demonstrate that the MCR-IM system achieves higher levels of spectral efficiency (SE) compared to existing systems. In this context, assigning multiple chirp rates to each user results in a reduction in the number of parallel channels. To mitigate this issue, we propose a peak detection based successive interference cancellation (PD-SIC) algorithm to accommodate more users. Compared to orthogonal scatter chirp spreading spectrum system that names OrthoRa, the MCR-IM system with PD-SIC algorithm achieves lower BER levels. For a similar number of collision signals, the throughput of the MCR-IM system is enhanced by 16% to 21%. Owing to these advantages, the proposed MCR-IM is well suited for large-scale, high-rate LoRa network applications.</description>

      <title>Polar Codes for Erasure and Unital Classical-Quantum Markovian Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider classical-quantum (cq-)channels with memory, and establish that Ar{\i}kan-constructed polar codes achieve the classical capacity for two key noise models, namely for (i) qubit erasures and (ii) unital qubit noise with channel state information at the receiver. The memory in the channel is assumed to be governed by a discrete-time, countable-state, aperiodic, irreducible, and positive recurrent Markov process. We establish this result by leveraging existing classical polar coding guarantees established for finite-state, aperiodic, and irreducible Markov processes [FAIM], alongside the recent finding that no entanglement is required to achieve the capacity of Markovian unital and erasure quantum channels when transmitting classical information. More broadly, our work illustrates that for cq-channels with memory, where an optimal coding strategy is essentially classical, polar codes can be shown to approach the capacity.</description>

      <title>FORTA: Byzantine-Resilient FL Aggregation via DFT-Guided Krum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure federated learning enables collaborative model training across decentralized users while preserving data privacy. A key component is secure aggregation, which keeps individual updates hidden from both the server and users, while also defending against Byzantine users who corrupt the aggregation. To this end, Jinhyun So et al. recently developed a Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation scheme using a secret-sharing strategy over finite-field arithmetic. However, such an approach can suffer from numerical errors and overflows when applied to real-valued model updates, motivating the need for secure aggregation methods that operate directly over the real domain. We propose FORTA, a Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation framework that operates entirely in the real domain. FORTA leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) codes for privacy and employs Krum-based outlier detection for robustness. While DFT decoder is error-free under infinite precision, finite precision introduces numerical perturbations that can distort distance estimates and allow malicious updates to evade detection. To address this, FORTA refines Krum using feedback from DFT decoder, improving the selection of trustworthy updates. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that our modification of Krum offers improved robustness and more accurate aggregation than standard Krum.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna-based Communications: Spectral Efficiency Analysis and Deployment Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiple-waveguide pinching-antenna (PA)-based multi-user communication system is investigated. With a given number of PAs, two deployment strategies are considered, namely the centralized PA deployment, where all PAs are switched between waveguides to serve users in a time-division manner to avail of beamforming gain, and the distributed PA deployment, where a single PA is deployed on each waveguide to simultaneously serve multiple users by leveraging the multiplexing gain. The spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by each deployment strategy is analyzed: i) For the centralized deployment, the positioning strategy of PAs on each waveguide is determined first with the aim of maximizing the channel gain of the corresponding nearest served user. Based on this, the corresponding system SE is derived. ii) For the distributed deployment, the system SE under the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is first obtained. To obtain an analytically tractable form, the stationary phase method is utilized to approximate the system SE. The approximation result reveals that the average inter-user interference can be negligible with a large waveguide spacing and thus the simple MRT is appealing for PA-based multi-user communications. Furthermore, the system SEs achieved by the two strategies are compared in both the high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Our analysis suggests that at high SNRs, the distributed deployment is superior to achieve the maximal system SE, while the centralized deployment is more suitable for the low-SNR regime. Finally, the theoretical analysis is verified through simulations.</description>

      <title>Transversal non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes breaking the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier and quantum-inspired geometry with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ systolic freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, a $\sqrt{N}log^{1/2}(N)$ distance barrier for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with $N$ qubits persisted for nearly two decades, until the recent discovery of the fibre-bundle code. An open question is whether such a distance barrier can be broken while preserving the ability to perform transversal non-Clifford gates. In this direction, another long-standing distance barrier of $N^{1/3}$ for LDPC stabilizer codes -- present since the discovery of the 3D color code -- was only recently overcome by a construction achieving an $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ distance (arXiv:2501.19375). The present work further breaks the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier by taking a homological product of three good qLDPC codes, combined with the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping and the triple cup product to implement transversal CCZ gates. The resulting code achieves an $\Omega(N^{2/3})$ distance (a linear $X$-distance of $\Theta(N)$) and a dimension of $\Theta(N^{2/3})$, which enables fault-tolerant preparation of $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ independent logical CCZ magic states in a single shot, without distillation (`magic state fountain'). This new quantum code also inspires the discovery of a family of exotic $3q$-dimensional manifolds $\mathcal{M}$, which exhibit both a power-law $\mathbb{Z}_2$-($q$, $2q$)-systolic freedom and $\Theta(vol(\mathcal{M}))$ triple intersection points of $2q$-dimensional submanifolds.</description>

Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist signaling serves as a promising solution for improving spectral efficiency in future generations of communications. However, its nature of fast acceleration brings highly overlapped pulses that lead to worse peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance. In this paper, we investigate the PAPR behavior of MIMO FTN using Gaussian symbols under optimal power allocation for two power constraints: fixed transmit power and fixed received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Our findings reveal that PAPR is mainly determined by the acceleration factor and the power constraint, but power allocation optimization does not change the PAPR behavior for Gaussian signaling.</description>

      <title>On an entropy inequality for quadratic forms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a non-degenerate rational quadratic form. Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent $(s, C)$-Frostman random variables whose ranges are contained in $[-c_1, c_1]$, with $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $C,c_1\geq 1$. We prove that there exist a positive constant $\epsilon = \epsilon(s,\phi)$ and an integer $N=N(s,C,c_1,\phi)$ such that
  $$\max\left\{H_n(X+Y),\,H_n(\phi(X,Y))\right\} \ge n(s+\epsilon)$$
  for all $n&gt;N$. The proof introduces a novel multi-step entropy framework, combining the submodularity formula, the discretized entropy Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and state-of-the-art results on the Falconer distance problem, to reduce general forms to a diagonal core case. As an application, we derive a result on a discretized sum-product type problem. In particular, for a $\delta$-separated set $A\subset [0, 1]$ of cardinality $\delta^{-s}$, satisfying some non-concentration conditions, there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(s, \phi)&gt;0$ such that $$E_\delta(A+A) + E_\delta(\phi(A, A)) \gg\delta^{-\epsilon}(\#A) $$ for all $\delta$ small enough. Here by $E_\delta(A)$ we mean the $\delta$-covering number of $A$.</description>

      <title>The Labeled Coupon Collector Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the well-known Coupon Collector Problem (CCP) in combinatorics. Our problem is to find the minimum and expected number of draws, with replacement, required to recover $n$ distinctly labeled coupons, with each draw consisting of a random subset of $k$ different coupons and a random ordering of their associated labels. We specify two variations of the problem, Type-I in which the set of labels is known at the start, and Type-II in which the set of labels is unknown at the start. We show that our problem can be viewed as an extension of the separating system problem introduced by R\'enyi and Katona, provide a full characterization of the minimum, and provide a numerical approach to finding the expectation using a Markov chain model, with special attention given to the case where two coupons are drawn at a time.</description>

      <title>Multi-beam Beamforming in RIS-aided MIMO Subject to Reradiation Mask Constraints -- Optimization and Machine Learning Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are an emerging technology for improving spectral efficiency and reducing power consumption in future wireless systems. This paper investigates the joint design of the transmit precoding matrices and the RIS phase shift vector in a multi-user RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system. We formulate a max-min optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate while considering transmit power and reradiation mask constraints. The achievable rate is simplified using the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm, and the problem is broken into quadratic programs with quadratic constraints (QPQC) sub-problems using an alternating optimization approach. To improve efficiency, we develop a model-based neural network optimization that utilizes the one-hot encoding for the angles of incidence and reflection. We address practical RIS limitations by using a greedy search algorithm to solve the optimization problem for discrete phase shifts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively shape the multi-beam radiation pattern towards desired directions while satisfying reradiation mask constraints. The neural network design reduces the execution time, and the discrete phase shift scheme performs well with a small reduction of the beamforming gain by using only four phase shift levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable-antennas (MAs) are revolutionizing spatial signal processing by providing flexible beamforming in next-generation wireless systems. This paper investigates an MA-empowered autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) system in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) for uplink data collection from ground users. We aim to maximize the sum achievable rate by jointly optimizing the AAV trajectory, receive beamforming, and MA positions. An efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that incorporates successive convex approximation, weighted minimum mean square error, and particle swarm optimization is developed. The analysis of the computational complexity and convergence features is provided. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance in terms of the sum achievable rate and the service reliability comparing to several benchmark schemes. These results demonstrate the distinctive advantages of the proposed scheme: enhanced spectral efficiency via adaptive beam-user alignment and improved collection reliability through spatial interference management, highlighting the implementation potential of the MA-empowered LAWNs.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS based Multiuser Uplink in Doubly-Spread Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless users with different characteristics will be expected to share spectrum in next generation communication networks. One of the great strengths of wireless networks based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the ease with which different non-overlapping time-frequency (TF) resources can be allocated to different users by simply shifting each user's signal in time and frequency. However, a significant weaknesses of OFDM is the inflexibility of sub-carrier spacing. Since OFDM does not allow users to have different sub-carrier spacing, a single user subject to inter-carrier interference causes carrier spacing to increase for all users. Zak-OTFS is an alternative delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme, where, in contrast to OFDM, the Input-Output (I/O) relation is predictable. We match the strength of OFDM by designing a novel DD domain method of shaping the transmitted Zak-OTFS pulse on the uplink that enables flexible non-overlapping TF resource allocation. The base station (BS) receives a superposition of uplink signals and applies individual matched filters to obtain the data specific to individual users. We develop theoretical measures of interference between users, and present numerical simulations for a vehicular channel model representative of next generation propagation environments. We demonstrate single-user performance in a multiuser Zak-OTFS uplink system without needing to provision guard bands between TF resources allocated to different users. These performance results demonstrate that the benefits of a predictable Zak-OTFS waveform can be realized within an architecture for uplink communication.</description>

      <title>On Strong Converse Bounds for the Private and Quantum Capacities of Anti-degradable Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a strong converse bound for the private classical capacity of anti-degradable quantum channels. Specifically, we prove that this capacity is zero whenever the error $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and privacy parameter $\delta &gt; 0$ satisfy the inequality $\delta (1-\epsilon^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}+\epsilon (1-\delta^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;1$. This result strengthens previous understandings by sharply defining the boundary beyond which reliable and private communication is impossible. Furthermore, we present a ``pretty simple'' proof of the ``pretty strong'' converse for the quantum capacity of anti-degradable channels, valid for any error $\epsilon &lt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Our approach offers clarity and technical simplicity, shedding new light on the fundamental limits of quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing, Computing and Semantic Communication for Emerging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation technologies. With high-frequency bands and large-scale antenna arrays, the Rayleigh distance extends, necessitating near-field (NF) models where waves are spherical. Although NF-ISAC improves both sensing and communication, it also poses challenges such as high data volume and potential privacy risks. To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which leverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only, thereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic communication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive mechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the NF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The proposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users and extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing quality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating optimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three sub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio. Beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA positioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher data rates and better privacy preservation.</description>

Abstract: This work develops a framework to discover relations between the components of the solution to a given initial-value problem for a first-order system of ordinary differential equations. This is done by using sparse identification techniques on the data represented by the numerical solution of the initial-value problem at hand. The only assumption is that there are only a few terms that connects the components, so that the mathematical relations to be discovered are sparse in the set of possible functions. We illustrate the method through examples of applications.</description>

      <title>Federated Split Learning with Improved Communication and Storage Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is one of the popular distributed machine learning (ML) solutions but incurs significant communication and computation costs at edge devices. Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel and reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model architecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to transmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in every global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial models for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage efficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an auxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a single model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients from the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server. Additionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in selected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We provide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its convergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results further indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction over existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks.</description>

Abstract: Transfer entropy (TE) is an information theoretic measure that reveals the directional flow of information between processes, providing valuable insights for a wide range of real-world applications. This work proposes Transfer Entropy Estimation via Transformers (TREET), a novel attention-based approach for estimating TE for stationary processes. The proposed approach employs Donsker-Varadhan representation to TE and leverages the attention mechanism for the task of neural estimation. We propose a detailed theoretical and empirical study of the TREET, comparing it to existing methods on a dedicated estimation benchmark. To increase its applicability, we design an estimated TE optimization scheme that is motivated by the functional representation lemma, and use it to estimate the capacity of communication channels with memory, which is a canonical optimization problem in information theory. We further demonstrate how an optimized TREET can be used to estimate underlying densities, providing experimental results. Finally, we apply TREET to feature analysis of patients with Apnea, demonstrating its applicability to real-world physiological data. Our work, applied with state-of-the-art deep learning methods, opens a new door for communication problems which are yet to be solved.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Semantic-Bit Coexisting Communication System</title>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems. Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to superior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).</description>

      <title>CP-OFDM Achieves the Lowest Average Ranging Sidelobe Under QAM/PSK Constellations</title>

Abstract: This paper aims to answer a fundamental question in the area of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC): What is the optimal communication-centric ISAC waveform for ranging? Towards that end, we first established a generic framework to analyze the sensing performance of communication-centric ISAC waveforms built upon orthonormal signaling bases and random data symbols. Then, we evaluated their ranging performance by adopting both the periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF), and defined the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) as a sensing performance metric. On top of that, we proved that among all communication waveforms with cyclic prefix (CP), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is the only globally optimal waveform that achieves the lowest ranging sidelobe for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) constellations, in terms of both the EISL and the sidelobe level at each individual lag of the P-ACF. As a step forward, we proved that among all communication waveforms without CP, OFDM is a locally optimal waveform for QAM/PSK in the sense that it achieves a local minimum of the EISL of the A-ACF. Finally, we demonstrated by numerical results that under QAM/PSK constellations, there is no other orthogonal communication-centric waveform that achieves a lower ranging sidelobe level than that of the OFDM, in terms of both P-ACF and A-ACF cases.</description>

      <title>Semantics-Guided Diffusion for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding in Wireless Image Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) offers a promising avenue for enhancing transmission efficiency by jointly incorporating source and channel statistics into the system design. A key advancement in this area is the deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) technique that designs a direct mapping of input signals to channel symbols parameterized by a neural network, which can be trained for arbitrary channel models and semantic quality metrics. This paper advances the DeepJSCC framework toward a semantics-aligned, high-fidelity transmission approach, called semantics-guided diffusion DeepJSCC (SGD-JSCC). Existing schemes that integrate diffusion models (DMs) with JSCC face challenges in transforming random generation into accurate reconstruction and adapting to varying channel conditions. SGD-JSCC incorporates two key innovations: (1) utilizing some inherent information that contributes to the semantics of an image, such as text description or edge map, to guide the diffusion denoising process; and (2) enabling seamless adaptability to varying channel conditions with the help of a semantics-guided DM for channel denoising. The DM is guided by diverse semantic information and integrates seamlessly with DeepJSCC. In a slow fading channel, SGD-JSCC dynamically adapts to the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly estimated from the channel output, thereby eliminating the need for additional pilot transmissions for channel estimation. In a fast fading channel, we introduce a training-free denoising strategy, allowing SGD-JSCC to effectively adjust to fluctuations in channel gains. Numerical results demonstrate that, guided by semantic information and leveraging the powerful DM, our method outperforms existing DeepJSCC schemes, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Downlink and Uplink ISAC in Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios. Within this framework, continuous operator-based signal models are employed to describe the sensing and communication processes. The performance of communication and sensing is analyzed using two information-theoretic metrics: the communication rate (CR) and the sensing rate (SR). 1) For downlink ISAC, three continuous beamforming designs are proposed: i) the communications-centric (C-C) design that maximizes the CR, ii) the sensing-centric (S-C) design that maximizes the SR, and iii) the Pareto-optimal design that characterizes the Pareto boundary of the CR-SR region. A low-complexity signal subspace-based approach is proposed to derive the closed-form optimal beamformers for the considered designs. On this basis, closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable CRs and SRs, and the downlink rate region achieved by CAPAs is characterized. 2) For uplink ISAC, the C-C and S-C successive interference cancellation-based methods are proposed to manage inter-functionality interference. Using the subspace approach closed-form expressions for the optimal detectors as well as the achievable CRs and SRs are derived. The uplink SR-CR region is characterized based on the time-sharing technique. Numerical results demonstrate that, for both downlink and uplink, CAPA-based ISAC achieves higher CRs and SRs as well as larger CR-SR regions compared to conventional spatially discrete array-based ISAC.</description>

      <title>Preserving Simultaneity and Chronology for Sensing in Perceptive Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of preserving the simultaneity and chronology of sensing events in multisensor systems with wireless links. The network uses temporal windows of integration (TWIs), borrowed from human multisensory perception, to preserve the temporal structure of the sensing data at the application side. We introduce a composite latency model for propagation, sensing, and communication that leads to the derivation of the probability of simultaneity violation. This is used to select the TWI duration aiming to achieve the desired degrees of chronological preservation, while maintaining the throughput of events. The letter provides important insights and analytical tools about the TWI impact on the event registration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantitative implications of the notion of log-concavity through a probabilistic interpretation. In particular, we derive concentration inequalities, moment and entropy bounds for random variables satisfying a precise degree of log-concavity. Along the way, we recover, improve, and simplify several results existing in the literature. Our approach is based on majorization in the convex order.</description>

      <title>Doubly transitive equiangular tight frames that contain regular simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An equiangular tight frame (ETF) is a finite sequence of equal norm vectors in a Hilbert space that achieves equality in the Welch bound, and so has minimal coherence. The binder of an ETF is the set of all subsets of its indices whose corresponding vectors form a regular simplex. An ETF achieves equality in Donoho and Elad's spark bound if and only if its binder is nonempty. When this occurs, its binder is the set of all linearly dependent subsets of it of minimal size. Moreover, if members of the binder form a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) then its incidence matrix can be phased to produce a sparse representation of its dual (Naimark complement). A few infinite families of ETFs are known to have this remarkable property. In this paper, we relate this property to the recently introduced concept of a doubly transitive equiangular tight frame (DTETF), namely an ETF for which the natural action of its symmetry group is doubly transitive. In particular, we show that the binder of any DTETF is either empty or forms a BIBD, and moreover that when the latter occurs, any member of the binder of its dual is an oval of this BIBD. We then apply this general theory to certain known infinite families of DTETFs. Specifically, any symplectic form on a finite vector space yields a DTETF, and we compute the binder of it and its dual, showing that the former is empty except in a single notable case, and that the latter consists of affine Lagrangian subspaces. This unifies and generalizes several results from the existing literature. We then consider the binders of four infinite families of DTETFs that arise from quadratic forms over the field of two elements, showing that two of these are empty except in a finite number of cases, whereas the other two form BIBDs that relate to each other, and to Lagrangian subspaces, in nonobvious ways.</description>

      <title>Restrictions on Physical Stochastic Reservoir Computers</title>

Abstract: Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</description>

      <title>A leave-one-out approach to approximate message passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate message passing (AMP) has emerged both as a popular class of iterative algorithms and as a powerful analytic tool in a wide range of statistical estimation problems and statistical physics models. A well established line of AMP theory proves Gaussian approximations for the empirical distributions of the AMP iterate in the high dimensional limit, under the GOE random matrix model and its variants.
  This paper provides a non-asymptotic, leave-one-out representation for the AMP iterate that holds under a broad class of Gaussian random matrix models with general variance profiles. In contrast to the typical AMP theory that describes the empirical distributions of the AMP iterate via a low dimensional state evolution, our leave-one-out representation yields an intrinsically high dimensional state evolution formula which provides non-asymptotic characterizations for the possibly heterogeneous, entrywise behavior of the AMP iterate under the prescribed random matrix models.
  To exemplify some distinct features of our AMP theory in applications, we analyze, in the context of regularized linear estimation, the precise stochastic behavior of the Ridge estimator for independent and non-identically distributed observations whose covariates exhibit general variance profiles. We find that its finite-sample distribution is characterized via a weighted Ridge estimator in a heterogeneous Gaussian sequence model. Notably, in contrast to the i.i.d. sampling scenario, the effective noise and regularization are now full dimensional vectors determined via a high dimensional system of equations.
  Our leave-one-out method of proof differs significantly from the widely adopted conditioning approach for rotational invariant ensembles, and relies instead on an inductive method that utilizes almost solely integration-by-parts and concentration techniques.</description>

      <title>Attention with Markov: A Framework for Principled Analysis of Transformers via Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention-based transformers have achieved tremendous success across a variety of disciplines including natural languages. To deepen our understanding of their sequential modeling capabilities, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study them. A key finding is that when trained on first-order Markov chains, transformers with two or more layers consistently develop an induction head mechanism to estimate the in-context bigram conditional distribution. In contrast, single-layer transformers, unable to form an induction head, directly learn the Markov kernel but often face a surprising challenge: they become trapped in local minima representing the unigram distribution, whereas deeper models reliably converge to the ground-truth bigram. While single-layer transformers can theoretically model first-order Markov chains, their empirical failure to learn this simple kernel in practice remains a curious phenomenon. To explain this contrasting behavior of single-layer models, in this paper we introduce a new framework for a principled analysis of transformers via Markov chains. Leveraging our framework, we theoretically characterize the loss landscape of single-layer transformers and show the existence of global minima (bigram) and bad local minima (unigram) contingent on data properties and model architecture. We precisely delineate the regimes under which these local optima occur. Backed by experiments, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are in congruence with the empirical results. Finally, we outline several open problems in this arena. Code is available at https://github.com/Bond1995/Markov .</description>

      <title>Plan for Speed: Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) promise fast, non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers, which pick tokens to unmask based on model confidence, ignore interactions when unmasking multiple positions in parallel and effectively reduce to slow, autoregressive behavior. We propose the Dilated Unmasking Scheduler (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent dilated groups and unmasked them in parallel so as to minimize an upper bound on joint entropy gain at each denoising step. By explicitly trading off the number of network calls against generation quality, DUS recovers most of the performance lost under traditional parallel unmasking strategies. Across math (GSM8K, MATH500), code (HumanEval, MBPP) and general-knowledge benchmarks (BBH, MMLU-Pro), DUS outperforms confidence-based planners, without modifying the underlying denoiser, and reveals the true speed-quality frontier of MDLMs.</description>

      <title>Unitary designs in nearly optimal depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$, $\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count $\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of pseudorandom unitaries.</description>
