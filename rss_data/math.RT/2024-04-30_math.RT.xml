      <title>Gordan-Rankin-Cohen operators on superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We distinguish two classifications of bidifferential operators: between (A) spaces of modular forms and (B) spaces of weighted densities.
  (A) The invariant under the projective action of $\text{SL}(2;\mathbb{Z})$ binary differential operators between spaces of modular forms of integer or half-integer weight on the 1-dimensional manifold were found by Gordan (called transvectants), rediscovered and classified by Rankin and Cohen (called brackets), and, in still another context, by Janson and Peetre. The invariant under the algebraic supergroup $\text{OSp}(1|2; \mathbb{Z})$ super modular forms of integer and half-integer weight on $(1|1)$-dimensional superstrings with contact structure were introduced, bidifferential operators between them classified and further studied by Gieres-Theisen, Cohen-Manin-Zagier, and Gargoubi-Ovsienko.
  (B) For any complex weights, we classify the analogs of Gordan-Rankin-Cohen (briefly: GRC) binary differential operators between spaces of weighted densities invariant under $\mathfrak{pgl}(2)$. For any complex weights, we classify the analogs of GRC-operators between spaces of weighted densities invariant under the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$. In the case of $(1|1)$-dimensional superstring without any additional structure, we also classify the analogs of GRC-operators between spaces of any weighted densities invariant under the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{pgl}(1|2)$.</description>

      <title>Unbounded $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-laminations around punctures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to study the unbounded $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-laminations [IK22], with a focus on their structures at punctures. A key ingredient is their relation to the root data of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$. After giving a classification of signed $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-webs around a puncture, we describe the tropicalization of the Goncharov--Shen's Weyl group action in detail. We also clarify the relationship with several other approaches by Shen--Sun--Weng [SSW23] and Fraser--Pylyavskyy [FP21]. Finally, we discuss a formulation of unbounded $\mathfrak{g}$-laminations for a general semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ in brief.</description>

      <title>Mutation of $n$-cotorsion pairs in triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we define the notion of $n$-cotorsion pairs in triangulated categories, which is a generalization of the classical cotorsion pairs. We prove that any mutation of an $n$-cotorsion pair is again an $n$-cotorsion pair. When $n=1$, this result generalizes the work of Zhou and Zhu for classical cotorsion pairs. As applications, we give a geometric characterization of $n$-cotorsion pairs in $n$-cluster categories of type $A$ and give a geometric realization of mutation of $n$-cotorsion pairs via rotation of certain configurations of $n$-diagonals.</description>

      <title>Rigid dualizing complexes of affine Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the rigid dualizing complex of the (generic) affine Hecke algebra $H_q$ attached to a reduced root system and deduce some structural properties as a consequence. For example, we show that the classical Hecke algebra $H_{q^\pm}$ as well as $H_q/q$ are, under a certain condition on the root system, Frobenius over their centers with Nakayama automorphism given by an explicit involution.</description>

      <title>Solution of a Problem in Monoidal Categorification by Additive Categorification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, Kashiwara-Kim-Oh-Park constructed cluster algebra structures on the Grothendieck rings of certain monoidal subcategories of the category of finite-dimensional representations of a quantum loop algebra, generalizing Hernandez-Leclerc's pioneering work from 2010. They stated the problem of finding explicit quivers for the seeds they used. We provide a solution by using Palu's generalized mutation rule applied to the cluster categories associated with certain algebras of global dimension at most 2, for example tensor products of path algebras of representation-finite quivers. Thus, our method is based on (and contributes to) the bridge, provided by cluster combinatorics, between the representation theory of quantum groups and that of quivers with relations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-Supersymmetric Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine generalized symmetries for 4D theories engineered via type II strings on non-supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds $\mathbb{R}^{3,1} \times \mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$. Probe branes detect generalized symmetries via the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in an associated quiver gauge theory. In situations where the tachyons are sequestered away from the boundary $S^5 / \Gamma$, this exactly matches the result extracted from singular homology. In situations with an unsequestered tachyon which stretches out to the boundary, the presence of tachyonic pulses partitions up the space into several distinct sectors, and the net contribution again matches with the answer expected via quiver methods. For IIA backgrounds, the presence of a localized closed string tachyon leads to transitions in the spectrum of states, generalized symmetries, higher-group symmetries, as well as the level matrix of the associated symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). For IIB backgrounds with a stack of spacetime filling probe D3-branes, the onset of a radiatively generated potential leads to similar considerations involving scale dependent transitions in the symmetries of the theory, including structures such as duality defects / interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a theory of scalar Fourier coefficients for a class of non-holomorphic, automorphic forms on the quaternionic real Lie group $\mathrm{U}(2,n)$. By studying the theta lifts of holomorphic modular forms from $\mathrm{U}(1,1)$, we apply this theory to obtain examples of non-holomorphic cusp forms on $\mathrm{U}(2,n)$ whose Fourier coefficients are algebraic numbers.</description>

      <title>The Procesi bundle over the $\Gamma$-fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of points in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and $n \geq 1$, we study the fibers of the Procesi bundle over the $\Gamma$-fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points in the plane. For each irreducible component of this fixed point locus, our approach reduces the study of the fibers of the Procesi bundle, as an $(\mathfrak{S}_n \times \Gamma)$-module, to the study of the fibers of the Procesi bundle over an irreducible component of dimension zero in a smaller Hilbert scheme. When $\Gamma$ is of type $A$, our main result shows, as a corollary, that the fiber of the Procesi bundle over the monomial ideal associated with a partition $\lambda$ is induced, as an $(\mathfrak{S}_n \times \Gamma)$-module, from the fiber of the Procesi bundle over the monomial ideal associated with the core of $\lambda$. We give different proofs of this corollary in two edge cases, using only representation theory and symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>An extended generalization of RSK via the combinatorics of type $A$ quiver representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence is a bijection from nonnegative integer matrices to pairs of semi-standard Young tableaux. Based on the work of, among others, Burge, Hillman, Grassl, Knuth and Gansner, it is known that a version of this correspondence gives, for any nonzero integer partition $\lambda$, a bijection from arbitrary fillings of $\lambda$ to reverse plane partitions of shape $\lambda$, via Greene--Kleitman invariants. By bringing out the combinatorial aspects of our recent results on quiver representations, we construct a family of bijections from fillings of $\lambda$ to reverse plane partitions of shape $\lambda$ parametrized by a choice of Coxeter element in a suitable symmetric group. We recover the above version of the Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence for a particular choice of Coxeter element depending on $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Generalisation of Rank two Complex Reflection Groups via Generators and Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex reflection groups of rank two are precisely the finite groups in the family of groups that we call virtual complex reflection groups of rank two. These groups are particular cases of $J$-groups as defined by Achar \&amp; Aubert in ['On rank 2 complex reflection groups', \emph{Comm. Algebra} \textbf{36}(6) (2008), 2092-2132]. Virtual complex reflection groups generalise both complex reflection groups of rank two and toric reflection groups, a family of groups defined and studied by Gobet in ['Toric reflection groups', \emph{Journal of the Australian Mathematical Society} \textbf{116} (2) (2024), 171-199]. We give uniform presentations by generators and relations of virtual complex reflection groups of rank two, which coincide with the presentations given by Brou\'e, Malle and Rouquier in ['Complex reflection groups, braid groups, Hecke algebras', \emph{J. reine angew. Math.} \textbf{500} (1998), 127-190.] when the groups are finite. In particular, these presentations provide uniform presentations for complex reflection groups of rank two where the generators are reflections (however the proof uses the classification of irreducible complex reflection groups). Moreover, we show that the center of virtual complex reflection groups is cyclic, generalising what happens for irreducible complex reflection groups of rank two and toric reflection groups. Finally, we classify virtual complex reflection groups up to reflection isomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring If $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ are $R$-linear triangulated categories then we can give an obvious triangulated structure on $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{C}_1 \oplus \mathcal{C}_2$ where $Hom_\mathcal{C}(U, V) = 0$ if $U \in \mathcal{C}_i$ and $V \in \mathcal{C}_j$ with $i \neq j$. We say a $R$-linear triangulated category $\mathcal{C}$ is disconnected if $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{C}_1 \oplus \mathcal{C}_2$ where $\mathcal{C}_i$ are non-zero triangulated subcategories of $\mathcal{C}$. Let $\mathcal{C}_i$ and $\mathcal{D}_j$ be connected triangulated $R$ categories with $i \in \Gamma$ and $j \in \Lambda$. Suppose there is an equivalence of triangulated $R$-categories \[ \Phi \colon \bigoplus_{i \in \Gamma}\mathcal{C}_i \xrightarrow{\cong} \bigoplus_{j \in \Lambda}\mathcal{D}_j \] Then we show that there is a bijective function $\pi \colon \Gamma \rightarrow \Lambda$ such that we have an equivalence $\mathcal{C}_i \cong \mathcal{D}_{\pi(i)} $ for all $i \in \Gamma$. We give several examples of connected triangulated categories and also of triangulated subcategories which decompose into utmost finitely many components.</description>

      <title>Equivariant quantizations of the positive nilradical and covariant differential calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a decomposition $\mathfrak{n} = \mathfrak{n}_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathfrak{n}_r$ of the positive nilradical of a complex semisimple Lie algebra of rank $r$, where each $\mathfrak{n}_k$ is a module under an appropriate Levi factor. We show that this can be quantized as a finite-dimensional subspace $\mathfrak{n}^q_k = \mathfrak{n}^q_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathfrak{n}^q_r$ of the positive part of the quantized enveloping algebra, where each $\mathfrak{n}^q_k$ is a module under the left adjoint action of a quantized Levi factor. Furthermore, we show that $\mathbb{C} \oplus \mathfrak{n}^q$ is a left coideal, with the possible exception of components corresponding to some exceptional Lie algebras. Finally we use these quantizations to construct covariant first-order differential calculi on quantum flag manifolds, compatible in a certain sense with the decomposition above, which coincide with those introduced by Heckenberger-Kolb in the irreducible case.</description>

      <title>On Noetherian algebras, Schur functors and Hemmer-Nakano dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Important connections in representation theory arise from resolving a finite-dimensional algebra by an endomorphism algebra of a generator-cogenerator with finite global dimension; for instance, Auslander's correspondence, classical Schur--Weyl duality and Soergel's Struktursatz. Here, the module category of the resolution and the module category of the algebra being resolved are linked via an exact functor known as Schur functor. In this paper, we investigate how to measure the quality of the connection between module categories of (projective) Noetherian algebras, $B$, and module categories of endomorphism algebras of generators-relative cogenerators over $B$ which are split quasi-hereditary Noetherian algebras. In particular, we are interested in finding, if it exists, the highest degree $n$ so that the endomorphism algebra of a generator-cogenerator provides an $n$-faithful cover, in the sense of Rouquier, of $B$. The degree $n$ is known as Hemmer-Nakano dimension of the standard modules. We prove that the Hemmer-Nakano dimension of standard modules with respect to a Schur functor from a split highest weight category over a field to the module category of a finite-dimensional algebra $B$ is bounded above by the number of non-isomorphic simple modules of $B$. We establish methods how to reduce computations of Hemmer-Nakano dimensions in the integral setup to computations of Hemmer-Nakano dimensions over finite-dimensional algebras. This theory allows us to derive results for Schur algebras and the BGG category O in the integral setup from the finite-dimensional case using relative dominant dimension. We exhibit several structural properties of deformations of the blocks of the BGG category O establishing an integral version of Soergel's Struktursatz. We show that deformations of the combinatorial Soergel's functor have better homological properties than the classical one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop two new homological invariants called relative dominant dimension with respect to a module and relative codominant dimension with respect to a module. These are used to establish precise connections between Ringel duality, split quasi-hereditary covers and double centraliser properties.
  These homological invariants are studied over Noetherian algebras which are finitely generated and projective as a module over the ground ring and they are shown to behave nicely under change of rings techniques. It turns out that relative codominant dimension with respect to a summand of a characteristic tilting module is a useful tool to construct quasi-hereditary covers of Noetherian algebras and measure their quality. In particular, this homological invariant is used to construct split quasi-hereditary covers of quotients of Iwahori-Hecke algebras using Ringel duality of $q$-Schur algebras. Combining techniques of cover theory with relative dominant dimension theory we obtain a new proof for Ringel self-duality of the blocks of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category $\mathcal{O}$.</description>

These dualities describe the endomorphism algebras of the tensor space and mixed tensor space, respectively, over the group algebra of the symmetric group and the Brauer wall algebra, respectively. Our main new results are the second part of the mixed Schur-Weyl dualities and mixed super Schur-Weyl dualities over an infinite ground field of positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Presentation of rational Schur algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present rational Schur algebra $S(n,r,s)$ over an arbitrary ground field $K$ as a quotient of the distribution algebra $Dist(G)$ of the general linear group $G=GL(n)$ by an ideal $I(n,r,s)$ and provide an explicit description of the generators of $I(n,r,s)$. Over fields $K$ of characteristic zero, this corrects and completes a presentation of $S(n,r,s)$ in terms of generators and relations originally considered by Dipper and Doty. The explicit presentation over ground fields of positive characteristics appears here for the first time.</description>

      <title>The unitary dual of $U(n,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a full classification of the unitary dual of $G = U(n,2)$ for $n \geq 3$. As a consequence, we determine which of these representations are weakly fair $A_{\mathfrak{q}}(\lambda)$-modules or special unipotent representations, resulting in a verification of a conjecture of Trapa and Vogan for $G$.</description>

      <title>Certain conjectures of Clozel and Shahidi on Arthur packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, applying the intersection theory of local Arthur packets, for symplectic and split odd special orthogonal groups $\mathrm{G}_n$, we prove the enhanced Shahidi conjecture on generic representations in local Arthur packets. As an application, we show that given any automorphic representation in the discrete spectrum of $\mathrm{G}_n(\mathbb{A})$, if a finite local component is generic, then almost all local components are generic. Next, we give a classification of the unramified representations of Arthur type for $\mathrm{G}_n$ and show that any unramified representation of $\mathrm{G}_n$ of Arthur type lies in exactly one local Arthur packet, moreover, it lies in the $L$-packet associated to an anti-generic local Arthur packet. As applications, we prove a reciprocal conjecture of Clozel and confirm a conjecture of Arthur and Clozel on the local components of automorphic representations in the discrete spectrum of $\mathrm{G}_n$.</description>

      <title>On monomial algebras with representation-finite enveloping algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper mainly considers the representation type of the enveloping algebra of monomial algebra. Let $A$ be a monomial algebra and $A^e= A\otimes_{\mathrm{l}\!\mathrm{k}} A^{\mathrm{op}}$ its enveloping algebra. It is shown that $A^e$ is representation-finite if and only if $A \cong \pmb{A}_n/\mathrm{rad}^2 \pmb{A}_n$, where $\pmb{A}_n$ is the path algebra $\mathrm{l}\!\mathrm{k}\mathcal{Q}$ with $\mathcal{Q} = 1 \longrightarrow 2 \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow n$. Moreover, we show that the number of all isoclasses of indecomposable $(\pmb{A}_n/ \mathrm{rad}^2\pmb{A}_n)^e$-modules is $\frac{4}{3}n^3 + n^2-\frac{7}{3}n+1$, and classify all indecomposable modules over $(\pmb{A}_n/ \mathrm{rad}^2\pmb{A}_n)^e$. Finally, the Clebsch-Gordon problem over $(\pmb{A}_n/ \mathrm{rad}^2\pmb{A}_n)^e$ is studied.</description>

      <title>Twists of Gr(3,n) Cluster Variables as Double and Triple Dimer Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial interpretation for certain cluster variables in Grassmannian cluster algebras in terms of double and triple dimer configurations. More specifically, we examine several Gr(3,n) cluster variables that may be written as degree two or degree three polynomials in terms of Pl\"ucker coordinates, and give generating functions for their images under the twist map - a cluster algebra automorphism introduced in work of Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky. The generating functions range over certain double or triple dimer configurations on an associated plabic graph, which we describe using particular non-crossing matchings or webs (as defined by Kuperberg), respectively. These connections shed light on a recent conjecture of Cheung et al., extend the concept of web duality introduced in a paper of Fraser-Lam-Le, and more broadly make headway on understanding Grassmannian cluster algebras for Gr(3,n).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We follow on from the pioneering paper by the second author where he introduces the Knutson Index for the character ring of a finite group. We introduce the Knutson Index for general commutative rings. We study it for Burnside rings and global representation rings. We also introduce the global table of a finite group, that encompasses both the character table and the Burnside table of marks.</description>

      <title>On Matlis reflexive modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matlis duality for modules over commutative rings gives rise to the notion of Matlis reflexivity. It is shown that Matlis reflexive modules form a Krull-Schmidt category. For noetherian rings the absence of infinite direct sums is a characteristic feature of Matlis reflexivity. This leads to a discussion of objects that are extensions of artinian by noetherian objects. Classifications of Matlis reflexive modules are provided for some small examples.</description>
