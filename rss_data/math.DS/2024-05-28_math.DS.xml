      <title>Efficient Model Reduction and Prediction of Superharmonic Resonances in Frictional and Hysteretic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern engineering structures exhibit nonlinear vibration behavior as designs are pushed to reduce weight and energy consumption. Of specific interest here, joints in assembled structures introduce friction, hysteresis, and unilateral contact resulting in nonlinear vibration effects. In many cases, it is impractical to remove jointed connections necessitating, the understanding of these behaviors. This work focuses on superharmonic and internal resonances in hysteretic and jointed systems. Superharmonic resonances occur when a nonlinear system is forced at an integer fraction of a natural frequency resulting in a large (locally maximal) response at an integer multiple of the forcing frequency. When a second vibration mode simultaneously responds in resonance at the forcing frequency, the combined phenomena is termed an internal resonance. First, variable phase resonance nonlinear modes (VPRNM) is extended to track superharmonic resonances in multiple degree of freedom systems exhibiting hysteresis. Then a novel reduced order model based on VPRNM (VPRNM ROM) is proposed to reconstruct frequency response curves faster than utilizing the harmonic balance method (HBM). The VPRNM ROM is demonstrated for a 3 degree of freedom system with a 3:1 internal resonance and for the jointed Half Brake-Reuss Beam (HBRB), which exhibits a 7:1 internal resonance. For the HBRB, new experimental results are used to validate the modeling approaches, and a previously developed physics-based friction model is further validated, achieving frequency predictions within 3%. For the considered cases, VPRNM ROM construction is up to 4 times faster than HBM, and the evaluation of the VPRNM ROM is up to 780,000 times faster than HBM. The modeling shows that both tangential slipping and normal direction clapping of the joint play important roles in exciting the superharmonic resonances in the HBRB.</description>

      <title>Analytic Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim at developing an EDMD-type algorithm that captures the spectrum of the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of analytic functions. Our method relies on an orthogonal projection on polynomial subspaces, which is equivalent to Taylor approximation in a data-driven setting. In the case of dynamics with a hyperbolic equilibrium, the method demonstrates excellent performance to capture the lattice structured Koopman spectrum based on the eigenvalues of the linearized system at the equilibrium. Moreover, it yields the Taylor approximation of associated principal eigenfunctions. Since the method preserves the triangular structure of the operator, it does not suffer from spectral pollution and, moreover, arbitrary accuracy on the spectrum can be reached with a fixed finite dimension of the approximation.</description>

      <title>Global existence and Rayleigh-Taylor instability for the semi-dissipative Boussinesq system with Naiver boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considered herein is the global existence of weak, strong solutions and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability for 2D semi-dissipative Boussinesq equations in an infinite strip domain $\Omega_{\infty}$ subject to Navier boundary conditions with non-positive slip coefficients. We first prove the global existence of weak and strong solutions on bounded domain $\Omega_{R}$ via the Galerkin method, characteristic analyzing technique and Stokes estimates etc. Based on above results, we further derive the uniform estimates, independent of the length of horizontal direction of $\Omega_{R}$, ensuring the global existence of weak and strong solutions in unbounded case $\Omega_{\infty}$ by utilizing the domain expansion method. Moreover, when the steady temperature is higher with decreasing height (i.e., RT steady-state) on certain region, we demonstrate that the steady-state is linear unstable through the construction of energy functional and the settlement of a family of modified variational problems. Furthermore, with the help of unstable solutions constructed in linear instability and global existence theorems, we confirm the instability of nonlinear problem in a Lipschitz structural sense. Finally, we give a series of rigorous verification (see Appendix) including the spectra of Stokes equations with Navier boundary conditions, Sobolev embedding inequalities, trace inequalities, and Stokes estimates under Navier boundary conditions etc, used in the proof of main conclusions.</description>

      <title>Network reduction and absence of Hopf Bifurcations in dual phosphorylation networks with three Intermediates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorylation networks, representing the mechanisms by which proteins are phosphorylated at one or multiple sites, are ubiquitous in cell signalling and display rich dynamics such as unlimited multistability. Dual-site phosphorylation networks are known to exhibit oscillations in the form of periodic trajectories, when phosphorylation and dephosphorylation occurs as a mixed mechanism: phosphorylation of the two sites requires one encounter of the kinase, while dephosphorylation of the two sites requires two encounters with the phosphatase. A still open question is whether a mechanism requiring two encounters for both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation also admits oscillations. In this work we provide evidence in favor of the absence of oscillations of this network by precluding Hopf bifurcations in any reduced network comprising three out of its four intermediate protein complexes. Our argument relies on a novel network reduction step that preserves the absence of Hopf bifurcations, and on a detailed analysis of the semi-algebraic conditions precluding Hopf bifurcations obtained from Hurwitz determinants of the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian of the system. We conjecture that the removal of certain reverse reactions appearing in Michaelis-Menten-type mechanisms does not have an impact on the presence or absence of Hopf bifurcations. We prove an implication of the conjecture under certain favorable scenarios and support the conjecture with additional example-based evidence.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions by higher-rank lattices: Classification and embedding in low dimensions, local rigidity, smooth factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study actions by lattices in higher-rank (semi)simple Lie groups on compact manifolds. By classifying certain measures invariant under a related higher-rank abelian action (the diagonal action on the suspension space) we deduce a number of new rigidity results related to standard projective actions (i.e. boundary actions) by such groups.
  Specifically, in low dimensions we show all actions (with infinite image) are conjugate to boundary actions. We also show standard boundary actions (e.g. projective actions on generalized flag varieties) are local rigid and classify all smooth actions that are topological factors of such actions. Finally, for volume-preserving actions in low dimensions (with infinite image) we provide a mechanism to detect the presence of "blow-ups" for the action by studying measures that are $P$-invariant but not $G$-invariant for the suspension action.</description>

      <title>Optimal Intervention Strategies and Cost-effectiveness Analysis study of Tuberculosis with reference to TPT, Malnutrition and Diabetes Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a significant global health challenge, with millions of new cases reported annually. Recent studies suggest that expanding the accessibility of TB intervention programs can lead to a substantial decrease in both TB incidence and prevalence. This paper initiates by examining a deterministic mathematical model for TB transmission, aiming to analyze the underlying dynamics. Subsequently, an optimal control problem is formulated to enhance TB control measures, encompassing Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment (TPT) and other initiatives targeting malnutrition and diabetes. Through simulation studies, the effectiveness of the control program is assessed. The model dynamics allow us to identify the pseudo-prevalence and incidence. To determine the potential long-term trajectory of TB and to acquire future projections a cost-effectiveness analysis is performed using ACER, AIR, ICER, and four quadrants to compare competing interventions. In conclusion, this work provides valuable insights into TB and strategies for its control and cost effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the fractal properties of the boundary of the Cantorval connected with Guthrie-Nymann's series. In particular, we prove that such a Cantorval can be represented as a union of open intervals and a Cantor set having zero Lebesgue measure and a fractional Hausdorff dimension. Moreover, we extend the result to a countable family of Cantorvals with a similar structure.</description>

      <title>From limit theorems to mixing limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by work of Dolgopyat and N\'andori, we establish a general method for upgrading limit theorems for Birkhoff sums and cocycles over dynamical systems to mixing limit theorems under mild ergodicity and hyperbolicity assumptions. Building on previous work of Al-Saqban and Forni, we apply this method to obtain mixing limit theorems for particular subbundles of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle. In forthcoming work of Arana-Herrera and Honaryar these results are applied to study the arithmetic/homological complexity of long simple closed geodesics on negatively curved surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the Analytical Properties of a Nonlinear Microscopic Dynamical Model for Connected and Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrated dynamical model of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) which incorporates CAV technologies and a microscopic car-following model to improve safety, efficiency and convenience. We rigorously investigate the analytical properties such as well-posedness, maximum principle, perturbation and stability of the proposed model in some proper functional spaces. Furthermore, we prove that the model is collision free and we derive and explicit lower bound on the distance as a safety measure.</description>

      <title>The role of spatial dimension in the emergence of localised radial patterns from a Turing instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of localised radial patterns from a Turing instability has been well studied in two and three dimensional settings and predicted for higher spatial dimensions. We prove the existence of localised $(n+1)$-dimensional radial patterns in general two-component reaction-diffusion systems near a Turing instability, where $n&gt;0$ is taken to be a continuous parameter. We determine explicit dependence of each pattern's radial profile on the dimension $n$ through the introduction of $(n+1)$-dimensional Bessel functions, revealing a deep connection between the formation of localised radial patterns in different spatial dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of Anosov diffeomorphisms with respect to the measure of maximal entropy. We highlight a profound connection between resonances and eigenvalues of the action induced by the dynamics on de Rham cohomology. We finally exploit this relation to get information about the Ruelle-Pollicott asymptotics of the correlation function and establish a cohomological bound for the speed of mixing of Anosov diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Determining the Possibility of Multistationarity in a Model of the Earth Carbon Cycle with Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of steady-state multiplicity or multistationarity in the Earth System raises the possibility that the Earth may reach a "tipping point" and rapidly transition to a warmer steady-state from which recovery may be practically impossible. In detailed Earth models that require extensive computation time, it is difficult to make an a priori prediction of the existence of steady-state multiplicity. In this study, we demonstrate Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT) analysis of a simple heuristic box model of the Earth System carbon cycle with the human intervention of direct air capture. The analysis reveals necessary conditions for the combination of system parameters where steady-state multiplicity may exist. With this method, other negative emissions technologies (NET) may be screened in a relatively simple manner to aid in the priority setting by policymakers.</description>

As an application for some parameter value for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE on the line with odd and periodic boundary conditions we prove the existence of infinite number of homo- and heteroclinic orbits to two periodic orbits.

      <description>arXiv:2405.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact second countable group equipped with an admissible non-degenerate Borel probability measure $\mu$. We generalize the notion of $\mu$-stationary systems to $\mu$-stationary $G$-factor maps $\pi: (X,\nu)\to (Y,\eta)$. For these stationary relations between dynamical systems, we provide a structure theorem, which generalizes the structure theorem of Furstenberg-Glasner. Furthermore, we show the existence and uniqueness of a relative version of the Poisson boundary in this setup.</description>

      <title>Iteration problem for several chaos in non-autonomous discrete system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the iteration problem for several chaos in non-autonomous discrete system. Firstly, we prove that the Li-Yorke chaos of a non-autonomous discrete dynamical system is preserved under iterations when $f_{1,\infty}$ converges to $f$, which weakens the condition in the literature that $f_{1,\infty}$ uniformly converges to $f$. Besides, we prove that both DC2' and Kato's chaos of a non-autonomous discrete dynamical system are iteration invariants. Additionally, we give a sufficient condition for non-autonomous discrete dynamical system to be Li-Yorke chaos. Finally, we give an example to show that the DC3 of a non-autonomous discrete dynamical system is not inherited under iterations, which partly answers an open question proposed by Wu and Zhu(Chaos in a class of non-autonomous discrete systems, Appl.Math.Lett. 2013,26:431-436).</description>

      <title>Bounded geometry for PCF-special subvarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each integer $d\geq 2$, let $M_d$ denote the moduli space of maps $f: \mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d$. We study the geometric configurations of subsets of postcritically finite (or PCF) maps in $M_d$. A complex-algebraic subvariety $Y \subset M_d$ is said to be PCF-special if it contains a Zariski-dense set of PCF maps. Here we prove that there are only finitely many positive-dimensional irreducible PCF-special subvarieties in $M_d$ with degree $\leq D$. In addition, there exist constants $N = N(D,d)$ and $B = B(D,d)$ so that for any complex algebraic subvariety $X \subset M_d$ of degree $\leq D$, the Zariski closure $\overline{X\cap\mathrm{PCF}}~$ has at most $N$ irreducible components, each with degree $\leq B$. We also prove generalizations of these results for points with small critical height in $M_d(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$.</description>

      <title>Finite Fractal Dimension of uniform attractors for non-autonomous dynamical systems with infinite dimensional symbol space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to find an upper bound for the box-counting dimension of uniform attractors for non-autonomous dynamical systems. Contrary to the results in literature, we do not ask the symbol space to have finite box-counting dimension. Instead, we ask a condition on the semi-continuity of pullback attractors of the system as time goes to infinity. This semi-continuity can be achieved if we suppose the existence of finite-dimensional exponential uniform attractors for the limit symbols. After showing these new results, we apply them to study the box-counting dimension of the uniform attractor for a reaction-diffusion equation, and we find a specific forcing term such that the symbol space has infinite box-counting dimension but the uniform attractor has finite box-counting dimension anyway.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a p-adic version of Duke's Theorem on the equidistribution of closed geodesics on modular curves. Our approach concerns quadratic fields split at p as well as a p-adic covering of the modular curve. We also prove an equidistribution result of Heegner points in the p-adic space attached to Shimura curves.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the intersection between geodesic and conformal currents on closed hyperbolic three-manifolds.
  We use this to prove some sharp bounds which involve the Liouville entropy of a negatively curved metric, the minimal surface entropy, and the area ratio. Using these ideas we also give a new proof of the Mostow Rigidity Theorem in the three-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Oscillations in neuronal activity: a neuron-centered spatiotemporal model of the Unfolded Protein Response in prion diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are characterized by the slow spatial spread of toxic protein species in the brain. The toxic proteins can induce neuronal stress, triggering the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which slows or stops protein translation and can indirectly reduce the toxic load. However, the UPR may also trigger processes leading to apoptotic cell death and the UPR is implicated in the progression of several NDs. In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical model to describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of the UPR mechanism for prion diseases. Our model is centered around a single neuron, with representative proteins P (healthy) and S (toxic) interacting with heterodimer dynamics (S interacts with P to form two S's). The model takes the form of a coupled system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with a delayed, nonlinear flux for P (delay from the UPR). Through the delay, we find parameter regimes that exhibit oscillations in the P- and S-protein levels. We find that oscillations are more pronounced when the S-clearance rate and S-diffusivity are small in comparison to the P-clearance rate and P-diffusivity, respectively. The oscillations become more pronounced as delays in initiating the UPR increase. We also consider quasi-realistic clinical parameters to understand how possible drug therapies can alter the course of a prion disease. We find that decreasing the production of P, decreasing the recruitment rate, increasing the diffusivity of S, increasing the UPR S-threshold, and increasing the S clearance rate appear to be the most powerful modifications to reduce the mean UPR intensity and potentially moderate the disease progression.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Incentive Design with Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can the system operator learn an incentive mechanism that achieves social optimality based on limited information about the agents' behavior, who are dynamically updating their strategies? To answer this question, we propose an \emph{adaptive} incentive mechanism. This mechanism updates the incentives of agents based on the feedback of each agent's externality, evaluated as the difference between the player's marginal cost and society's marginal cost at each time step. The proposed mechanism updates the incentives on a slower timescale compared to the agents' learning dynamics, resulting in a two-timescale coupled dynamical system. Notably, this mechanism is agnostic to the specific learning dynamics used by agents to update their strategies. We show that any fixed point of this adaptive incentive mechanism corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism, ensuring that the Nash equilibrium coincides with the socially optimal strategy. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the convergence of the adaptive incentive mechanism to a fixed point. Our results apply to both atomic and non-atomic games. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism, we verify the convergence conditions in two practically relevant games: atomic networked quadratic aggregative games and non-atomic network routing games.</description>

      <title>All iterated function systems are Lipschitz up to an equivalent metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite family $\mathcal{F}=\{f_1,\ldots,f_n\}$ of continuous selfmaps of a given metric space $X$ is called an iterated function system (shortly IFS). In a case of contractive selfmaps of a complete metric space is well-known that IFS has an unique attractor \cite{Hu}. However, in \cite{LS} authors studied highly non-contractive IFSs, i.e. such families $\mathcal{F}=\{f_1,\ldots,f_n\}$ of continuous selfmaps that for any remetrization of $X$ each function $f_i$ has Lipschitz constant $&gt;1, i=1,\ldots,n.$ They asked when one can remetrize $X$ that $\mathcal{F}$ is Lipschitz IFS, i.e. all $f_i's$ are Lipschitz (not necessarily contractive), $ i=1,\ldots,n$. We give a general positive answer for this problem by constructing respective new metric (equivalent to the original one) on $X$, determined by a given family $\mathcal{F}=\{f_1,\ldots,f_n\}$ of continuous selfmaps of $X$. However, our construction is valid even for some specific infinite families of continuous functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove quantitative decay estimates of macroscopic quantities generated by the solutions to linear transport equations driven by a general family of Hamiltonians. The associated particle trajectories are all trapped in a compact region of phase-space and feature a non-degenerate elliptic stagnation point. The analysis covers a large class of Hamiltonians generated by the radially symmetric compactly supported equilibria of the gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system. Working in radial symmetry, our analysis features both the 1+2-dimensional case and the harder 1+1-dimensional case, where all the particles have the same value of the modulus of angular momentum. The latter case is also of importance in both the plasma physics case and two dimensional incompressible fluid flows.</description>

Abstract: We show that for $g\ge 2$, all integers $1 \le d \le 3g-3$ arise as trace field degrees of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes in the Torelli group of the closed orientable surface of genus $g$. Our method uses the Thurston-Veech construction of pseudo-Anosov maps, and we provide examples where the stretch factor has algebraic degree any even number between two and $6g-6$. This validates a claim by Thurston from the 1980s.</description>

      <title>Suppressing defection by increasing temptation: the impact of smart cooperators on a social dilemma situation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a social dilemma situation, where individual and collective interests are in conflict, it sounds a reasonable assumption that the presence of super or smart players, who simultaneously punish defection and reward cooperation without allowing exploitation, could solve the basic problem. The behavior of such a multi-strategy system, however, is more subtle than it is firstly anticipated. When exploring the complete parameter space, we find that the emergence of cyclic dominance among strategies is rather common, which results in several counter-intuitive phenomena. For example, the defection level can be lowered at higher temptation, or weaker punishment provides better conditions for smart players. Our study indicates that smart cooperators can unexpectedly thrive under high temptation, emphasizing the complexity of strategic interactions. This study suggests that the principles governing these interactions can be applied to other moral behaviors, such as truth-telling and honesty, providing valuable insights for future research in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>On the Quenched Functional Central Limit Theorem for Stationary Random Fields under Projective Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.01672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study and establish some quenched functional Central Limit Theorems (CLTs) for stationary random fields under a projective criteria. These results are functional generalizations of the theorems obtained by Zhang et al. (2020) and of the quenched functional CLTs for ortho-martingales established by Peligrad and Voln{\'y}  (2020) to random fields satisfying a Hannan type projective condition. In the work of Zhang et al. (2020), the authors have already proven a quenched functional CLT however the assumptions were not optimal as they require the existence of a 2 + $\delta$-moment. In this article, we establish the results under weaker assumptions, namely we only require an Orlicz space condition to hold. The methods used to obtain these generalizations are somewhat similar to the ones used by Zhang et al. (2020) but we improve on them in order to obtain results within the functional framework. Moreover, a Rosenthal type inequality for said Orlicz space is also derived and used to obtain a sufficient condition analogous to that of Theorem 4.4 in the work of Zhang et al. (2020). Finally, we apply our new results to derive some quenched functional CLTs under weak assumptions for a variety of stochastic processes.</description>

Abstract: Given a one-dimensional dynamical system we study its cover time, which quantifies the rate at which orbits become dense in the state space. Using transfer operator tools for dynamical systems with holes and inducing techniques, for a wide class of uniformly hyperbolic and non-uniformly hyperbolic systems we obtain an asymptotic formula for the expected cover time in terms of the decay rate of the measure of the ball of minimum measure. Applications include the Gauss map and Manneville-Pomeau maps.</description>

      <title>An embedding theorem for multidimensional subshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krieger's embedding theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary subshift to embed in a given topologically mixing $\mathbb{Z}$-subshift of finite type. For some $\mathbb{Z}^d$-subshifts of finite type, Lightwood characterized the \emph{aperiodic} subsystems. In the current paper we prove a new embedding theorem for a class of subshifts of finite type over any countable abelian group. Our main theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary subshift $X$ to embed inside a given subshift of finite type $Y$ that satisfies a certain condition. For the particular case of $\mathbb{Z}$-subshifts, our new theorem coincides with Krieger's theorem. In particular, our result gives the first complete characterization of the subsystems of the multidimensional full shift $Y= A^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$. The natural condition on the target subshift $Y$, introduced explicitly for the first time in the current paper, is called the map extension property. It was introduced implicitly by Mike Boyle in the early 1980's for $\mathbb{Z}$-subshifts, and is closely related to the notion of an absolute retract, introduced by Borsuk in the 1930's. A $\mathbb{Z}$-subshift has the map extension property if and only if it is a topologically mixing subshift of finite type. Over abelian groups, a subshift has the map extension property if and only if it is a contractible SFT as shown in work of Poirier and Salo. We also establish a new theorem regarding lower entropy factors of multidimensional subshifts, that extends Boyle's lower entropy factor theorem from the one-dimensional case.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of relative weighted topological pressures, and we prove two variational principles. We generalize the Relative Variational Principle of Ledrappier and Walter to a weighted version, also, prove a variational principle which is a relative version of the result proved by Tsukamoto (New approach to weighted topological entropy and pressure, Ergodic Theory Dynam. systems. 43 (2023) 1004-1034) while involving the question mentioned by Feng and Huang (Variational principle for weighted topological pressure, J. Math. Pures Appl. 106 (2016), 411-452) that is: Given $0\leq \omega\leq 1$, let $\pi:(X,T)\to (Y,S)$ and $\varphi:(Y,S)\to (Z,R)$ be factor maps, there exists a relativized variational principle for weighted pressures which has the form
  \[P^\omega_Z(\pi,T,f)=\sup_{\mu\in \mathcal{M}(X,T)}\left(\omega h_\mu(T|R)+(1-\omega)h_{\pi\mu}(S|R)+\omega\int_Xfd\mu\right),\]
  where $P^\omega_Z(\pi,T,f)$ is the relative weighted topological pressure and $h_{\{\cdot\}}(\cdot|R)$ are the conditional metric entropy w.r.t $(Z,R)$ in the paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate a fractional stochastic neutral differential equation with time delay, which includes both deterministic and stochastic components. Our primary objective is to rigorously prove the existence of a unique solution that satisfies given initial conditions. Furthermore, we extend our research to investigate the finite-time stability of the system by examining trajectory behavior over a given period. We employ advanced mathematical approaches to systematically prove finite-time stability, providing insights on convergence and stability within the stated interval. Using illustrative examples, we strengthen this all-encompassing examination into the complicated dynamics and stability features of fractionally ordered stochastic systems with time delays. The implications of our results extend to various fields, such as control theory, engineering, and financial mathematics, where understanding the stability of complex systems is crucial.</description>

      <title>Positive topological entropy for the Standard Map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for the standard map family, for all values of the parameter, except one, the mapping has positive topological entropy. The main tool is the following result.
  Let $S$ be a compact connected orientable surface and $f:S \rightarrow S$ an area preserving orientation preserving $C \e 1$ diffeomorphism of $S$. Assume that $U$ is an invariant domain of $S$ such that $fr_S{U}$ has a finite number of connected components.
  Let $b$ be a regular ideal boundary point of $U$ which is fixed under the induced action by $f$ on the ideal boundary of $U$, and let $\hat{f}:C(b) \rightarrow C(b)$ the homeomorphism on the corresponding circle of prime ends.
  Let $Z(b)$ be the impression of $b$ in $S$ and assume that all fixed points of $f$ in $Z(b)$ are non degenerate.
  If there exists a fixed prime end $e \in C(b)$ then we know the following.
  $\left(1\right)$ If $p$ is the principal point of $e$ then $p$ is also a fixed point of $Z(b)$ and $p$ is a saddle.
  $\left(2\right)$ $C(b)$ has a finite number of fixed prime ends and there exists a finite singular covering $ \phi :C(b) \rightarrow Z(b)$, which is a semiconjugacy between the mapping of prime ends on $C(b)$ and the restriction of $f$ to $Z(b)$. In particular, $Z(b)$ is the connected union of finitely many saddle connections and the corresponding saddles.
  This can be seen as a two dimensional generalization of the dynamics of homeomorphisms of the circle with fixed points.</description>

      <title>On ergodic properties of geodesic flows on uniform visibility manifolds without conjugate points</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on ergodic properties of the geodesic flow on a $C^\infty$ uniform visibility manifold $M$ without conjugate points. If $M$ is a closed surface of genus at least two without conjugate points, and with continuous Green bundles and bounded asymptote, we study the geometric properties of singular geodesics and show that if all singular geodesics are closed, then there are at most finitely many isolated singular closed geodesics and finitely many generalized strips. In particular, the geodesic flow is ergodic with respect to Liouville measure under the above assumption.
  Let $(M,g)$ be a closed uniform visibility manifold without conjugate points and $X$ its universal cover. Under the entropy gap assumption, the geodesic flow has a unique measure of maximal entropy (MME for short) by \cite[Theorem 1.2]{MR}. We develop a Patterson-Sullivan construction of this unique MME and show that it has local product structure, is fully supported, and has the Bernoulli property.
  If we assume further that $M$ has continuous Green bundles and the geodesic flow has a hyperbolic periodic point, using the nonuniform hyperbolic structure on an open dense subset and the symbolic approach developed in \cite{LP}, we show that for any H\"{o}lder continuous function, the equilibrium state is unique under the pressure gap condition.
  Under the same conditions above, we apply the mixing properties of the MME to count the number of free-homotopy classes containing a closed geodesic, as well as the volume asymptotics of Riemannian balls in the universal cover. We then obtain some rigidity results involving the Margulis function.
  Finally, for a uniform visibility manifold $M=X/\Gamma$ (not necessarily compact) without conjugate points, we show that if $\Gamma$ is non-elementary and contains an expansive isometry, then the Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy holds.</description>

      <title>Validated integration of semilinear parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) is an essential ingredient for studying the dynamics of the solutions. Indeed, simulations are at the core of scientific computing, but their mathematical reliability is often difficult to quantify, especially when one is interested in the output of a given simulation, rather than in the asymptotic regime where the discretization parameter tends to zero. In this paper we present a computer-assisted proof methodology to perform rigorous time integration for scalar semilinear parabolic PDEs with periodic boundary conditions. We formulate an equivalent zero-finding problem based on a variations of constants formula in Fourier space. Using Chebyshev interpolation and domain decomposition, we then finish the proof with a Newton--Kantorovich type argument. The final output of this procedure is a proof of existence of an orbit, together with guaranteed error bounds between this orbit and a numerically computed approximation. We illustrate the versatility of the approach with results for the Fisher equation, the Swift--Hohenberg equation, the Ohta--Kawasaki equation and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We expect that this rigorous integrator can form the basis for studying boundary value problems for connecting orbits in partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Non-free almost finite actions for locally finite-by-virtually $\mathbb{Z}$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study almost finiteness and almost finiteness in measure of non-free actions. Let $\alpha:G\curvearrowright X$ be a minimal action of a locally finite-by-virtually $\mathbb{Z}$ group $G$ on the Cantor set $X$. We prove that under certain assumptions, the action $\alpha$ is almost finite in measure if and only if $\alpha$ is essentially free. As an application, we obtain that any minimal topologically free action of a virtually $\mathbb{Z}$ group on an infinite compact metrizable space with the small boundary property is almost finite. This is the first general result, assuming only topological freeness, in this direction, and these lead to new results on uniform property $\Gamma$ and $\mathcal{Z}$-stability for their crossed product $C^*$-algebras. Some concrete examples of minimal topological free (but non-free) subshifts are provided.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <title>On disjoint dynamical properties and Lipschitz-free spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of disjoint $\mathcal{A}$-transitivity for a Furstenberg family $\mathcal{A}$ is introduced with the aim to generalize properties derived from disjoint hypercyclic operators. We begin a systematic study by showing some of the basic properties, including necessary conditions to inherit the property on the whole space from an invariant linearly dense set containing the origin. As a consequence, we continue the study of the link between non-linear and linear dynamics through Lipschitz-free spaces by presenting some necessary conditions to obtain disjoint $\mathcal{A}$-transitivity for families of Lipschitz-free operators on $\mathcal{F}(M)$ expressed in terms of conditions in the underlying metric space $M$.</description>
