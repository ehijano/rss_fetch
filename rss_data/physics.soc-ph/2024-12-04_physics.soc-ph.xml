      <title>The Role of Social Interactions in Mitigating Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Study in Sri Lanka</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive changes in many aspects related to social groups of different socioeconomic backgrounds were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result, the overall state of mental health was severely affected globally. This study examined how the pandemic affected Sri Lankan citizens representing a range of socioeconomic backgrounds in terms of their mental health. The data used in this research was gathered from 3020 households encompassing 12,000 people using a nationwide face-to-face survey. Four distinct factors were identified by factor analysis (FA) that was conducted and subsequently, the population was clustered using unsupervised clustering to determine which socioeconomic categories were affected similarly. Two population subgroups were thus identified, their respective relationships to the retrieved components and their demographics were thoroughly examined and interpreted. This resulted in the identification of contrasting perspectives between the two groups towards the maintenance and the state of social relationships during the pandemic, which revealed that one group were more 'outgoing' in nature resulting in their mental state being comparatively better in coping with the pandemic. The other group was seen to be more 'reserved' showing an opposite reaction towards social connections while their mental well-being declined showing symptoms such as loneliness, and emptiness.</description>

      <title>Feature importance of socio-economic parameters in Tuberculosis modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of modeling epidemic outbreaks in different regions with a common model, that uses additional information about these regions to adjust its parameters and relieve us of mundanity of data collecting, and inverse problem solving for each region separately. To that end, we study tuberculosis and HIV dynamics in regions of Russian Federation from 2009 to 2023 in connection with number of socio-economic parameters. SIR-like model was taken and modified as a dynamic model for tuberculosis-HIV co-infection and inverse problem of transfer rates between compartments was solved, based on statistical data of diseases incidence. To shorten the list of socio-economic parameters we make use of Shapley vector that allows us to estimate importance of these parameters in reconstruction of differential model parameters using regression algorithms.</description>

      <title>Statistical and Mathematical Evidence of Rigged Parliamentary Elections in Georgia, 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The official data provided by "Central Election Commission" was analyzed, revealing irregularities that raised reasonable suspicion of election manipulation by the winning ``Georgian Dream Party." However, these suspicions alone were insufficient to provide concrete evidence. A computational approach was developed based on the official data to address this. Through this analysis, one method estimated the number of manipulated votes to range between 140,000 and 200,000, while another approach estimated a broader range of 90,000 to 245,000 votes. Notably, both methods identified the most probable number of manipulated votes as 175,000, providing a strong mathematical basis to substantiate the claim of election falsification.</description>

      <title>The connection between non-normality and trophic coherence in directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trophic coherence and non-normality are both ways of describing the overall directionality of directed graphs, or networks. Trophic coherence can be regarded as a measure of how neatly a graph can be divided into distinct layers, whereas non-normality is a measure of how unlike a matrix is with its transpose. We explore the relationship between trophic coherence and non-normality by first considering the connections that exist in the literature and calculating the trophic coherence and non-normality for some toy networks. We then explore how persistence of an epidemic in an SIS model depends on coherence, and how this relates to the non-normality. A similar effect on dynamics governed by a linear operator suggests that it may be useful to extend the concept of trophic coherence to matrices which do not necessarily represent graphs.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis of brain dynamical signals reveals signatures of seizure susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy is known to drastically alter brain dynamics during seizures (ictal periods). However, whether epilepsy may alter brain dynamics during background (non-ictal) periods is less understood. To investigate this, we analyzed the brain activity of epileptic zebrafish as animal models, for two genetic conditions and two fishlines. The recordings were automatically segmented and labeled with machine learning, and then analyzed using Persistent Homology, a method from Topological Data Analysis, which reveals patterns in the topology of brain dynamics in a noise-robust and networkbased manner. We find that ictal and non-ictal periods can be distinguished from the topology of their dynamics, regardless of fishline or genetic condition, which validates our method. Additionally, within a single fishline wild type, we can distinguish the non-ictal periods of seizure-prone and seizure-free individuals. This suggests the presence of topological signatures of the epileptic brain, even during non-ictal periods. In general, our results suggest that Topological Data Analysis can be used as a general quantitative method to screen for dynamical markers of seizure susceptibility also in other species.</description>

      <title>Quantum Decision Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose to use the formalism of quantum mechanics to describe and explain the so-called "abnormal" behaviour of agents in certain decision or choice contexts. The basic idea is to postulate that the preferences of these agents are indeterminate (in the quantum sense of the term) before the choice is made or the decision is taken. An agent's state before the decision is represented by a superposition of potential preferences. The decision is assimilated to a measure of the agent's state and leads to a projection of the state onto one of the particular preferences. We therefore consider that uncertainty about preferences is not linked to incomplete information but to essential indeterminacy. We explore the consequences of these hypotheses on the usual concepts of decision theory and apply the formalism to the problem of the so-called "framing" effect.</description>

      <title>Driving Reductions in Emissions Unlocking the Potential of Fuel Economy Targets in Saudi Arabia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of more stringent fuel economy standards represents a pivotal pathway toward achieving net zero emissions in the transportation sector. By steadily increasing the fuel efficiency of vehicles, this approach drives a gradual but consistent decline in emissions. When coupled with the simultaneous integration of electric and alternative fuel vehicles into the market, the goal of net zero emissions becomes increasingly feasible.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from establishing a rooftop photovoltaic system crowdsourced by students and employees at Aarhus University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy communities are promoted in the European legislation as a strategy to enable citizen participation in the energy transition. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, due to their distributed nature, present an opportunity to create such communities. At Aarhus University (Denmark), we have established an energy community consisting of a 98-kW rooftop solar PV installation, crowdsourced by students and employees of the university. The participants can buy one or several shares of the installation (which is divided into 900 shares), the electricity is consumed by the university, and the shareowners receive some economic compensation every year. The road to establishing this energy community has been rough, and we have gathered many learnings. In this manuscript, we present the 10 largest challenges which might arise when setting up a university energy community and our particular approach to facing them. Sharing these learnings might pave the way for those willing to establish their own energy community. We also include policy recommendations at a European, national, and municipality levels to facilitate the deployment of energy communities</description>

      <title>Structural robustness of networks with degree-degree correlations between second-nearest neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the robustness of networks with degree-degree correlations between nodes separated by distance $l=2$ in terms of shortest path length. The degree-degree correlation between the $l$-th nearest neighbors can be quantified by Pearson's correlation coefficient $r_l$ for the degrees of two nodes at distance $l$. We introduce $l$-th nearest-neighbor correlated random networks ($l$-NNCRNs) that are degree-degree correlated at less than or equal to the $l$-th nearest neighbor scale and maximally random at farther scales. We generate $2$-NNCRNs with various $r_1$ and $r_2$ using two steps of random edge rewiring based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and compare their robustness against failures of nodes and edges. As typical cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous degree distributions, we adopted Poisson and power law distributions. Our results show that the range of $r_2$ differs depending on the degree distribution and the value of $r_1$. Moreover, comparing $2$-NNCRNs sharing the same degree distribution and $r_1$, we demonstrate that a higher $r_2$ makes a network more robust against random node/edge failures as well as degree-based targeted attacks, regardless of whether $r_1$ is positive or negative.</description>

      <title>Voter demographics and socio-economic factors in kinetic models for opinion formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voter demographics and socio-economic factors like age, sex, ethnicity, education level, income, and other measurable factors like behaviour in previous elections or referenda are of key importance in modelling opinion formation dynamics. Here, we revisit the kinetic opinion formation model from D\"uring and Wright (2022) and compare in more detail the influence of different choices of characteristic demographic factors and initial conditions. The model is based on the kinetic opinion formation model by Toscani (2006) and the leader-follower model of D\"uring et al. (2009) which leads to a system of Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equations. In the run-up to the 2024 general election in the United Kingdom, we consider in our numerical experiments the situation in the so-called `Red Wall' in North and Midlands of England and compare our simulation results to other election forecasts.</description>

      <title>A Dissipativity Approach to Analyzing Composite Spreading Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of spreading processes often analyzes networks at different resolutions, e.g., at the level of individuals or countries, but it is not always clear how properties at one resolution can carry over to another. Accordingly, in this work we use dissipativity theory from control system analysis to characterize composite spreading networks that are comprised by many interacting subnetworks. We first develop a method to represent spreading networks that have inputs and outputs. Then we define a composition operation for composing multiple spreading networks into a larger composite spreading network. Next, we develop storage and supply rate functions that can be used to demonstrate that spreading dynamics are dissipative. We then derive conditions under which a composite spreading network will converge to a disease-free equilibrium as long as its constituent spreading networks are dissipative with respect to those storage and supply rate functions. To illustrate these results, we use simulations of an influenza outbreak in a primary school, and we show that an outbreak can be prevented by decreasing the average interaction time between any pair of classes to less than 79% of the original interaction time.</description>

      <title>Strong localization blurs criticality of time series for spreading phenomena on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze critical time series of the order parameter generated with active to inactive phase transitions of spreading dynamics running on the top of heterogeneous networks. Different activation mechanisms that govern the dynamics near the critical point were investigated. The time series were analyzed using the visibility graph (VG) method where a disassortative degree correlation of the VG is a signature of criticality. In contrast, assortative correlation is associated with offcritical dynamics. The signature of criticality given by the VG is confirmed for collective activation phenomena, as in the case of homogeneous networks. Similarly, for a localized activation driven by a densely connected set of hubs, identified by a maximum k-core decomposition, critical times series were also successfully identified by the VG method. However, in the case of activation driven by sparsely distributed hubs, the time series criticality is blurred, being observable only for huge systems. In the case of strong structural localization induced by the presence of rare regions, an assortative VG degree correlation, typical of off-critical series, is observed. We conclude that while macroscopic times series remain good proxies for the analysis of criticality for collective or maximum k-core activation, systems under spatial localization can postpone the signatures of or, in case of extreme localization, lead to false negatives for criticality of time series.</description>

      <title>Understanding complex crowd dynamics with generative neural simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of pedestrian crowds is an outstanding challenge crucial for designing efficient urban infrastructure and ensuring safe crowd management. To this end, both small-scale laboratory and large-scale real-world measurements have been used. However, these approaches respectively lack statistical resolution and parametric controllability, both essential to discovering physical relationships underlying the complex stochastic dynamics of crowds. Here, we establish an investigation paradigm that offers laboratory-like controllability, while ensuring the statistical resolution of large-scale real-world datasets. Using our data-driven Neural Crowd Simulator (NeCS), which we train on large-scale data and validate against key statistical features of crowd dynamics, we show that we can perform effective surrogate crowd dynamics experiments without training on specific scenarios. We not only reproduce known experimental results on pairwise avoidance, but also uncover the vision-guided and topological nature of N-body interactions. These findings show how virtual experiments based on neural simulation enable data-driven scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Realizing interdependent couplings as thermal or higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interdependence is a fundamental ingredient to analyze the stability of many real-world complex systems featuring functional liasons. Yet, physical realizations of this coupling are still unknown, due to the lack of a theoretical framework for their study. To address this gap, we develop an interdependent magnetization framework and show that dependency links between $K-1$ pairwise networks of Ising spins can be rigorously mapped to directed $K$-spin interactions or to adaptive thermal couplings. We adopt the thermal portrait to determine analytically the phase diagram of the model under different structural configurations and we corroborate our results by extensive simulations. We find that interdependence acts like an entropic force that amplifies site-to-site thermal fluctuations, yielding unusual forms of vulnerability and making the system's functioning often unrecoverable. Finally, we discover an isomorphism between the ground state of random multi-spin models and interdependent percolation on randomly coupled networks. This connection raises new perspectives of cross-fertilization, providing unfamiliar methods with relevant implications in the study of constraint satisfaction as well as to the functional robustness of interdependent systems.</description>

      <title>Divergence asymmetry and connected components in a general duplication-divergence graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter introduces a generalization of known duplication-divergence models for growing random graphs. This general duplication-divergence model includes a new coupled divergence asymmetry rate, which allows to obtain the structure of random growing networks by duplication-divergence in a continuous range of configurations between two known limit cases (i) complete asymmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect only edges of either the original or the copy vertex, and (ii) symmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect equiprobably both the original and the copy vertex. Multiple connected sub-graphs (of order greater than one) (of order greater than one) emerge as the divergence asymmetry rate slightly moves from the complete asymmetric divergence case. Mean-field results of priorly published models are nicely reproduced by this generalization. In special cases, the connected components size distribution $C_s$ suggests a power-law scaling of the form $C_s \sim s^{-\lambda}$ for $s&gt;1$, e.g., with $\lambda \approx 5/3$ for divergence rate $\delta \approx 0.7$.</description>
