      <title>Circuit-free cardiovascular monitoring via skin-interfaced nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring is essential for managing circulatory health and disease, yet most wearable sensors are constrained by reliance on electrical transduction and built-in electronics. We present a circuit-free, wholly optical approach using diffraction from a skin-interfaced nanostructured surface to detect minute skin strains from the arterial pulse. A smartphone camera records the shifting diffraction pattern in real time, removing the need for spectrometers or other optical hardware. In phantom and human studies, we recovered high-fidelity arterial pulse waves and detected benign arrhythmic events in close agreement with a clinical reference. Derived waveforms captured features linked to arterial stiffness, a key cardiovascular risk marker. Our approach uses battery-free, cost-effective, and disposable platforms enabling scalable monitoring for healthcare and broad consumer applications.</description>

      <title>Variational phase-field modeling of fracture and fatigue in shape memory alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational phase-field model for fracture and fatigue in pseudoelastic shape memory alloys (SMAs). The model, developed in a one-dimensional setting, builds upon the Auricchio-Petrini constitutive formulation for SMAs and couples damage evolution with phase transformation. We study analytically and numerically the homogeneous and localization responses of a bar under both monotonic and cyclic loading, and we investigate various macroscopic behaviors by tuning the constitutive parameters. A key feature of the model is the introduction of a transformation strain limit, beyond which the material is fully martensitic and behaves elastically. This leads to a distinctive behavior in which the region of localized damage widens, yielding a delay of fracture. The capability of the model to predict the fatigue performance is demonstrated by simulating the uniaxial response of Ni-Ti multi-wire samples under different loading conditions. The results show promising agreement with experimental fatigue life data, enabling the discrimination between safe and critical loading scenarios.</description>

      <title>Extending the Growth Temperature-N Concentration Regime Through Pd Doping in Fe4N Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fe4N is a well-known anti-perovskite compound exhibiting high magnetization, high chemical stability, low coercivity, high Curie temperature, and high spin-polarization ratio. Therefore, it is a viable candidate for applications in spintronic and magnetic storage devices. However, the Fe4N phase is formed in a narrow substrate temperature (Ts)-N concentration (Nc) regime in the phase diagram of Fe-N. It has been observed that a slight N deficiency will lead to impurity of alpha-Fe, and some N efficiency would result in epsilon-Fe3N phase. Through this work, it has been demonstrated that the doping of Pd can be suitably utilized to extend the Ts-Nc regime for the growth of Fe4N thin films. EXAFS analysis indicate that Pd atoms are substituting corner Fe atoms. Magnetization measurements reveal that the saturation magnetization reduces nominally with Pd doping up to 13 at.%. Therefore, it is foreseen that Pd doping is effective in extending the Fe4N phase formation regime without a significant impact on its structural, electronic, and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Using NV centers in diamond to detect DC to very-low frequency magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a compact and portable tabletop magnetometer that utilizes negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The magnetometer is operated using a dual microwave resonance detection approach in combination with an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technique (mitigating drifts in results due to changes of the diamond temperature), capable of simultaneously exciting and registering two ODMR transitions. The experimentally measured magnetic field noise-floor is $\approx 2.3~\textrm{nT}\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ while the calculated shot-noise-limited magnetic field sensitivity is $\approx 585~\textrm{pT}\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ when excited with a continuous wave laser at 0.5~W.
  These results pave the way for realizing a simple set-up magnetometer for precise single axis magnetic field measurements for example for accurate electric current measurements for stabilization purposes and magnetic communication applications.</description>

      <title>Achieving high-performance polarization-independent nonreciprocal thermal radiation with pattern-free heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many advanced energy harvesting technologies rely on advanced control of thermal emission. Recently, it has been shown that the emissivity and absorptivity of thermal emitters can be controlled independently in nonreciprocal emitters. While significant progress has been made in engineering these nonreciprocal thermal emitters, realizing a highly efficient, pattern-free emitter capable of supporting dual-polarization nonreciprocal emission remains a challenging task. Existing solutions are largely based on metamaterials and exhibit polarization-dependent behavior. This work proposes pattern-free multilayer heterostructures combining magneto-optical and magnetic Weyl semimetal materials and systematically evaluates their nonreciprocal emission performance for p- and s-polarized waves. The findings show that omnidirectional polarization-independent nonreciprocity can be achieved utilizing multilayer structures with different magnetization directions that do not follow simple vector summation. To further enhance the performance, Pareto optimization is employed to tune the key design parameters, enabling the maximization of nonreciprocal thermal emission in a given wavelength range. This approach offers a versatile strategy for designing high-performance thermal emitters tailored for multi-objective optical functionalities.</description>

      <title>Volcano Architecture for Scalable Quantum Processor Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information processing platforms based on array of matter qubits, such as neutral atoms, trapped ions, and quantum dots, face significant challenges in scalable addressing and readout as system sizes increase. Here, we propose the "Volcano" architecture that establishes a new quantum processing unit implementation method based on optical channel mapping on a arbitrarily arranged static qubit array. To support the feasibility of Volcano architecture, we show a proof-of-principle demonstration by employing a photonic chip that leverages custom-designed three-dimensional waveguide structures to transform one-dimensional beam arrays into arbitrary two-dimensional output patterns matching qubit array geometries. We demonstrate parallel and independent control of 49-channel with negligible crosstalk and high uniformity. This architecture addresses the challenges in scaling up quantum processors, including both the classical link for parallel qubit control and the quantum link for efficient photon collection, and holds the potential for interfacing with neutral atom arrays and trapped ion crystals, as well as networking of heterogeneous quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Upscaling from ab initio atomistic simulations to electrode scale: The case of manganese hexacyanoferrate, a cathode material for Na-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalizable scale-bridging computational framework that enables predictive modeling of insertion-type electrode materials from atomistic to device scales. Applied to sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, a promising cathode material for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries, our methodology employs an active-learning strategy to train a Moment Tensor Potential through iterative hybrid grand-canonical Monte Carlo--molecular dynamics sampling, robustly capturing configuration spaces at all sodiation levels. The resulting machine learning interatomic potential accurately reproduces experimental properties including volume expansion, operating voltage, and sodium concentration-dependent structural transformations, while revealing a four-order-of-magnitude difference in sodium diffusivity between the rhombohedral (sodium-rich) and tetragonal (sodium-poor) phases at 300 K. We directly compute all critical parameters -- temperature- and concentration-dependent diffusivities, interfacial and strain energies, and complete free-energy landscapes -- to feed them into pseudo-2D phase-field simulations that predict phase-boundary propagation and rate-dependent performances across electrode length scales. This multiscale workflow establishes a blueprint for rational computational design of next-generation insertion-type materials, such as battery electrode materials, demonstrating how atomistic insights can be systematically translated into continuum-scale predictions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced cooperativity of J-exciton-polaritons in dielectric BIC metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly correlated photon sources can be realized through cooperative coupling among quantum systems, giving rise to superradiant collective emission. In solid-state ensembles, however, such collective behaviour is confined to subwavelength dimensions and is strongly suppressed at room temperature by inhomogeneous broadening and rapid dephasing, limiting practical implementations. Here, we show that molecular J-aggregates sustain room temperature superradiant emission and enter a highly collective regime when strongly coupled to delocalized photonic modes of a silicon bound-state-in-the-continuum (BIC) metasurface, extending J-exciton interactions far beyond the subwavelength limit. This enhanced cooperativity produces a Rabi-splitting-dependent increase in emission rate and intensity and drives the system into a highly superbunched photon emission regime with g(2)(0)&gt;13. Stochastic modelling reveals that metasurface-mediated synchronization of ~10^3 J-excitons occurs within coupled superradiant domains spanning up to 8.5 um in diameter, corresponding to a 50-fold increase in inter-aggregate cooperative distance. These results establish common-mode coupling in resonant dielectric metasurfaces as a scalable route for engineering ultrafast, temporally correlated light sources operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Local-available quantum correlation swapping in one-parameter X states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although introduced for entanglement, quantum repeaters and swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such as quantum discord. In 2015, Mundarain and Ladr\'on de Guevara [Quantum Inf. Process. 14, 4493 (2015)] introduced local-available quantum correlations (LAQC), which are a promising yet understudied quantum correlation. Recently, Bellorin et al. [Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 22500990 (2022), Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 2250154 (2022)] obtained exact analytical results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Building up from those results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial states are non-classical and the one used for the projective measurement is entangled, the final state will generally have non-zero LAQC. Using the properties of this quantum correlation, we establish the conditions for a QCS scheme that leads to a final state with a non-zero LAQC measure. We illustrate these results by analyzing five families of one-parameter 2-qubit X states, including families where the projective measure leads to a separable state, but whose LAQC measure is non-zero. This feature opens the possibility for this quantum correlation to be considered a genuine resource in quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Optical Response in Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog bolometers based on temperature-dependent phase-transition materials such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and barium titanate (BTO) represent the state of the art in uncooled infrared detectors. Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Device and Circuit Modeling: A Case Study of NeuroSPICE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present NeuroSPICE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for device and circuit simulation. Unlike conventional SPICE, which relies on time-discretized numerical solvers, NeuroSPICE leverages PINNs to solve circuit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by minimizing the residual of the equations through backpropagation. It models device and circuit waveforms using analytical equations in time domain with exact temporal derivatives. While PINNs do not outperform SPICE in speed or accuracy during training, they offer unique advantages such as surrogate models for design optimization and inverse problems. NeuroSPICE's flexibility enables the simulation of emerging devices, including highly nonlinear systems such as ferroelectric memories.</description>
