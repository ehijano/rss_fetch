      <title>Efficient Historical Butterfly Counting in Large Temporal Bipartite Networks via Graph Structure-aware Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite graphs are ubiquitous in many domains, e.g., e-commerce platforms, social networks, and academia, by modeling interactions between distinct entity sets. Within these graphs, the butterfly motif, a complete 2*2 biclique, represents the simplest yet significant subgraph structure, crucial for analyzing complex network patterns. Counting the butterflies offers significant benefits across various applications, including community analysis and recommender systems. Additionally, the temporal dimension of bipartite graphs, where edges activate within specific time frames, introduces the concept of historical butterfly counting, i.e., counting butterflies within a given time interval. This temporal analysis sheds light on the dynamics and evolution of network interactions, offering new insights into their mechanisms. Despite its importance, no existing algorithm can efficiently solve the historical butterfly counting task. To address this, we design two novel indices whose memory footprints are dependent on #butterflies and #wedges, respectively. Combining these indices, we propose a graph structure-aware indexing approach that significantly reduces memory usage while preserving exceptional query speed. We theoretically prove that our approach is particularly advantageous on power-law graphs, a common characteristic of real-world bipartite graphs, by surpassing traditional complexity barriers for general graphs. Extensive experiments reveal that our query algorithms outperform existing methods by up to five magnitudes, effectively balancing speed with manageable memory requirements.</description>

      <title>Important node identification for complex networks based on improved Electre Multi-Attribute fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence maximization problem involves selecting a subset of seed nodes within a social network to maximize information spread under a given diffusion model, so how to identify the important nodes is the problem to be considered in this paper. Due to the great differences in the reality of the network, a class of multi-attribute decision fusion methods is often used to solve this problem. Electre is mostly used to solve the problems of investment order, benefit, and risk assessment of projects in economics, which supports the decision maker to make choices by comparing the differences between a set of alternatives. In this paper, we propose a multi-attribute decision fusion method named SK-E, which construct local and global metrics for different networks, use the improved Electre to make decision fusion between local and global metrics of nodes, to get the optimal weight between local and global metrics, and then identify the important nodes. The proposed method demonstrates superior accuracy compared to other methods, as evaluated through three experiments: the SIR epidemic model, the independent cascade model, and constraint efficiency. These experiments were conducted across six different real networks selected as the experimental dataset.</description>

      <title>Beyond symmetrization: effective adjacency matrices and renormalization for (un)singed directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the peculiarities of directed and/or signed graphs, new Laplacian operators have emerged. For instance, in the case of directionality, we encounter the magnetic operator, dilation (which is underexplored), operators based on random walks, and so forth. The definition of these new operators leads to the need for new studies and concepts, and consequently, the development of new computational tools. But is this really necessary? In this work, we define the concept of effective adjacency matrices that arise from the definition of deformed Laplacian operators such as magnetic, dilation, and signal. These effective matrices allow mapping generic graphs to a family of unsigned, undirected graphs, enabling the application of the well-explored toolkit of measures, machine learning methods, and renormalization groups of undirected graphs. To explore the interplay between deformed operators and effective matrices, we show how the Hodge-Helmholtz decomposition can assist us in navigating this complexity.</description>

      <title>Maximum $k$-Plex Search: An Alternated Reduction-and-Bound Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $k$-plexes relax cliques by allowing each vertex to disconnect to at most $k$ vertices. Finding a maximum $k$-plex in a graph is a fundamental operator in graph mining and has been receiving significant attention from various domains. The state-of-the-art algorithms all adopt the branch-reduction-and-bound (BRB) framework where a key step, called reduction-and-bound (RB), is used for narrowing down the search space. A common practice of RB in existing works is SeqRB, which sequentially conducts the reduction process followed by the bounding process once at a branch. However, these algorithms suffer from the efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a new alternated reduction-and-bound method AltRB for conducting RB. AltRB first partitions a branch into two parts and then alternatively and iteratively conducts the reduction process and the bounding process at each part of a branch. With newly-designed reduction rules and bounding methods, AltRB is superior to SeqRB in effectively narrowing down the search space in both theory and practice. Further, to boost the performance of BRB algorithms, we develop efficient and effective pre-processing methods which reduce the size of the input graph and heuristically compute a large $k$-plex as the lower bound. We conduct extensive experiments on 664 real and synthetic graphs. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm kPEX with AltRB and novel pre-processing techniques runs up to two orders of magnitude faster and solves more instances than state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fairness in Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection through Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is increasingly crucial in various applications, ranging from financial fraud detection to fake news detection. However, current GAD methods largely overlook the fairness problem, which might result in discriminatory decisions skewed toward certain demographic groups defined on sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.). This greatly limits the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios in light of societal and ethical restrictions. To address this critical gap, we make the first attempt to integrate fairness with utility in GAD decision-making. Specifically, we devise a novel DisEntangle-based FairnEss-aware aNomaly Detection framework on the attributed graph, named DEFEND. DEFEND first introduces disentanglement in GNNs to capture informative yet sensitive-irrelevant node representations, effectively reducing societal bias inherent in graph representation learning. Besides, to alleviate discriminatory bias in evaluating anomalous nodes, DEFEND adopts a reconstruction-based anomaly detection, which concentrates solely on node attributes without incorporating any graph structure. Additionally, given the inherent association between input and sensitive attributes, DEFEND constrains the correlation between the reconstruction error and the predicted sensitive attributes. Our empirical evaluations on real-world datasets reveal that DEFEND performs effectively in GAD and significantly enhances fairness compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To foster reproducibility, our code is available at https://github.com/AhaChang/DEFEND.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Flocking of Protesters on Street Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of protesters scattered throughout a city who want to gather into large and mobile groups. This model relies on random walkers on a street network that follow tactics built from a set of basic rules. Our goal is to identify the most important rules for fast and robust flocking of walkers. We explore a wide set of tactics and show the central importance of a specific rule based on alignment. Other rules alone perform poorly, but our experiments show that combining alignment with them enhances flocking, and that obtained groups are then remarkably robust.</description>

      <title>Operationalizing content moderation "accuracy" in the Digital Services Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Digital Services Act, recently adopted by the EU, requires social media platforms to report the "accuracy" of their automated content moderation systems. The colloquial term is vague, or open-textured -- the literal accuracy (number of correct predictions divided by the total) is not suitable for problems with large class imbalance, and the ground truth and dataset to measure accuracy against is unspecified. Without further specification, the regulatory requirement allows for deficient reporting. In this interdisciplinary work, we operationalize "accuracy" reporting by refining legal concepts and relating them to technical implementation. We start by elucidating the legislative purpose of the Act to legally justify an interpretation of "accuracy" as precision and recall. These metrics remain informative in class imbalanced settings, and reflect the proportional balancing of Fundamental Rights of the EU Charter. We then focus on the estimation of recall, as its naive estimation can incur extremely high annotation costs and disproportionately interfere with the platform's right to conduct business. Through a simulation study, we show that recall can be efficiently estimated using stratified sampling with trained classifiers, and provide concrete recommendations for its application. Finally, we present a case study of recall reporting for a subset of Reddit under the Act. Based on the language in the Act, we identify a number of ways recall could be reported due to underspecification. We report on one possibility using our improved estimator, and discuss the implications and areas for further legal clarification.</description>

      <title>Network Formation and Dynamics Among Multi-LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social networks shape opinions, behaviors, and information dissemination in human societies. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into social and professional environments, understanding their behavior within the context of social interactions and networks becomes essential. Our study analyzes LLMs' network formation behavior to examine whether the dynamics of multiple LLMs are similar to or different from human social dynamics. We observe that LLMs exhibit key social network principles, including preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and the small-world phenomenon, when asked about their preferences in network formation. We also investigate LLMs' decision-making based on real-world networks, revealing that triadic closure and homophily have a stronger influence than preferential attachment and that LLMs perform well in network formation predictions. Overall, our study opens up new possibilities for using LLMs in network science research and helps develop socially aware LLMs by shedding light on their social interaction behaviors and exploring their impacts on social dynamics.</description>

      <title>Negative Impact of Online Political Incivility on Willingness to See Political Comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been significant attention on online political incivility. While previous research suggests that uncivil political comments lead people to be less willing to see more comments on the same issue, two critical questions have received limited exploration: (1) Are people exposed to uncivil political comments less willing to see other comments from the person who posted the uncivil comment?; (2) Are people exposed to uncivil political comments less willing to see comments from people who have different thoughts than them? To address these questions, the present study conducted a preregistered online survey experiment targeting Japanese citizens, focusing on the pro- vs anti-Kishida cabinet conflict in Japan. The results show that the participants were less willing to see other comments by the person who posted the comment when the comment was uncivil than when it was civil. In addition, the anti-Kishida participants were less willing to see political opinions posted online by people who have different thoughts than them when the comment was uncivil than when it was civil, while the participants in the other subgroups did not show a similar tendency. These findings suggest that uncivil expressions in online political communication might prompt people to avoid reading opinions from those who have different thoughts than them, which might promote political echo chambers.</description>

      <title>CACL: Community-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Social Media Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media bot detection is increasingly crucial with the rise of social media platforms. Existing methods predominantly construct social networks as graph and utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) for bot detection. However, most of these methods focus on how to improve the performance of GNNs while neglecting the community structure within social networks. Moreover, GNNs based methods still face problems such as poor model generalization due to the relatively small scale of the dataset and over-smoothness caused by information propagation mechanism. To address these problems, we propose a Community-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning framework (CACL), which constructs social network as heterogeneous graph with multiple node types and edge types, and then utilizes community-aware module to dynamically mine both hard positive samples and hard negative samples for supervised graph contrastive learning with adaptive graph enhancement algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework addresses the previously mentioned challenges and outperforms competitive baselines on three social media bot benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Word frequency and sentiment analysis of twitter messages during Coronavirus pandemic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.03925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 epidemic has had a great impact on social media conversation, especially on sites like Twitter, which has emerged as a hub for public reaction and information sharing. This paper deals by analyzing a vast dataset of Twitter messages related to this disease, starting from January 2020. Two approaches were used: a statistical analysis of word frequencies and a sentiment analysis to gauge user attitudes. Word frequencies are modeled using unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, with power law distribution as the fitting model. The validity of the model is confirmed through metrics like Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), R-squared ($R^2$), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). High $R^2$ and low SSE/RMSE values indicate a good fit for the model. Sentiment analysis is conducted to understand the general emotional tone of Twitter users messages. The results reveal that a majority of tweets exhibit neutral sentiment polarity, with only 2.57\% expressing negative polarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the parameters of a probabilistic directed graphical model from incomplete data is a long-standing challenge. This is because, in the presence of latent variables, both the likelihood function and posterior distribution are intractable without assumptions about structural dependencies or model classes. While existing learning methods are fundamentally based on likelihood maximization, here we offer a new view of the parameter learning problem through the lens of optimal transport. This perspective licenses a general framework that operates on any directed graphs without making unrealistic assumptions on the posterior over the latent variables or resorting to variational approximations. We develop a theoretical framework and support it with extensive empirical evidence demonstrating the versatility and robustness of our approach. Across experiments, we show that not only can our method effectively recover the ground-truth parameters but it also performs comparably or better than competing baselines on downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Graph Diffusion History from a Single Snapshot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00488v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion on graphs is ubiquitous with numerous high-impact applications. In these applications, complete diffusion histories play an essential role in terms of identifying dynamical patterns, reflecting on precaution actions, and forecasting intervention effects. Despite their importance, complete diffusion histories are rarely available and are highly challenging to reconstruct due to ill-posedness, explosive search space, and scarcity of training data. To date, few methods exist for diffusion history reconstruction. They are exclusively based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) formulation and require to know true diffusion parameters. In this paper, we study an even harder problem, namely reconstructing Diffusion history from A single SnapsHot} (DASH), where we seek to reconstruct the history from only the final snapshot without knowing true diffusion parameters. We start with theoretical analyses that reveal a fundamental limitation of the MLE formulation. We prove: (a) estimation error of diffusion parameters is unavoidable due to NP-hardness of diffusion parameter estimation, and (b) the MLE formulation is sensitive to estimation error of diffusion parameters. To overcome the inherent limitation of the MLE formulation, we propose a novel barycenter formulation: finding the barycenter of the posterior distribution of histories, which is provably stable against the estimation error of diffusion parameters. We further develop an effective solver named DIffusion hiTting Times with Optimal proposal (DITTO) by reducing the problem to estimating posterior expected hitting times via the Metropolis--Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo method (M--H MCMC) and employing an unsupervised graph neural network to learn an optimal proposal to accelerate the convergence of M--H MCMC. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Open-Set Graph Anomaly Detection via Normal Structure Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an important Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) task, namely open-set GAD, which aims to train a detection model using a small number of normal and anomaly nodes (referred to as seen anomalies) to detect both seen anomalies and unseen anomalies (i.e., anomalies that cannot be illustrated the training anomalies). The availability of those labelled training data provides crucial prior knowledge about abnormalities for GAD models, enabling substantially reduced detection errors. However, current methods tend to over-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to a weak generalisation ability to detect the unseen anomalies. Further, they were introduced to handle Euclidean data, failing to effectively capture important information on graph structure and node attributes for GAD. In this work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely Normal Structure Regularisation (NSReg) to achieve generalised detection ability to unseen anomalies, while maintaining its effectiveness on detecting seen anomalies. The key idea in NSReg is to introduce a regularisation term that enforces the learning of compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes based on their structural relations to other nodes. When being optimised with supervised anomaly detection losses, the regularisation term helps incorporate strong normality into the modelling, and thus, it effectively avoids the overfitting the seen anomalies solely. In doing so, it helps learn better normality decision boundary, reducing the errors of detecting unseen anomalies as normal. Extensive empirical results on seven real-world datasets show the superiority of NSReg for open-set GAD.</description>

      <title>FedHCDR: Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation with Hypergraph Signal Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02630</link>

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has drawn significant attention, which utilizes user data from multiple domains to enhance the recommendation performance. However, current CDR methods require sharing user data across domains, thereby violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed for Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation (FedCDR). Nevertheless, the data heterogeneity across different domains inevitably influences the overall performance of federated learning. In this study, we propose FedHCDR, a novel Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation framework with Hypergraph signal decoupling. Specifically, to address the data heterogeneity across domains, we introduce an approach called hypergraph signal decoupling (HSD) to decouple the user features into domain-exclusive and domain-shared features. The approach employs high-pass and low-pass hypergraph filters to decouple domain-exclusive and domain-shared user representations, which are trained by the local-global bi-directional transfer algorithm. In addition, a hypergraph contrastive learning (HCL) module is devised to enhance the learning of domain-shared user relationship information by perturbing the user hypergraph. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world scenarios demonstrate that FedHCDR outperforms existing baselines significantly.</description>

      <title>Graph Machine Learning based Doubly Robust Estimator for Network Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of inferring causal effects in social network data. This results in challenges due to interference -- where a unit's outcome is affected by neighbors' treatments -- and network-induced confounding factors. While there is extensive literature focusing on estimating causal effects in social network setups, a majority of them make prior assumptions about the form of network-induced confounding mechanisms. Such strong assumptions are rarely likely to hold especially in high-dimensional networks. We propose a novel methodology that combines graph machine learning approaches with the double machine learning framework to enable accurate and efficient estimation of direct and peer effects using a single observational social network. We demonstrate the semiparametric efficiency of our proposed estimator under mild regularity conditions, allowing for consistent uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate that our method is accurate, robust, and scalable via an extensive simulation study. We use our method to investigate the impact of Self-Help Group participation on financial risk tolerance.</description>

      <title>Illicit Promotion on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an extensive study of the promotion of illicit goods and services on Twitter, a popular online social network(OSN). This study is made possible through the design and implementation of multiple novel tools for detecting and analyzing illicit promotion activities as well as their underlying campaigns. As the results, we observe that illicit promotion is prevalent on Twitter, along with noticeable existence on other three popular OSNs including Youtube, Facebook, and TikTok. Particularly, 12 million distinct posts of illicit promotion (PIPs) have been observed on the Twitter platform, which are widely distributed in 5 major natural languages and 10 categories of illicit goods and services, e.g., drugs, data leakage, gambling, and weapon sales. What are also observed are 580K Twitter accounts publishing PIPs as well as 37K distinct instant messaging (IM) accounts that are embedded in PIPs and serve as next hops of communication, which strongly indicates that the campaigns underpinning PIPs are also of a large scale. Also, an arms race between Twitter and illicit promotion operators is also observed. On one hand, Twitter is observed to conduct content moderation in a continuous manner and almost 80% PIPs will get gradually unpublished within six months since posted. However, in the meantime, miscreants adopt various evasion tactics to masquerade their PIPs, which renders more than 90% PIPs keeping hidden from the detection radar for two months or longer.</description>

      <title>Robust Reward Placement under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05433v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a problem of placing generators of rewards to be collected by randomly moving agents in a network. In many settings, the precise mobility pattern may be one of several possible, based on parameters outside our control, such as weather conditions. The placement should be robust to this uncertainty, to gain a competent total reward across possible networks. To study such scenarios, we introduce the Robust Reward Placement problem (RRP). Agents move randomly by a Markovian Mobility Model with a predetermined set of locations whose connectivity is chosen adversarially from a known set $\Pi$ of candidates. We aim to select a set of reward states within a budget that maximizes the minimum ratio, among all candidates in $\Pi$, of the collected total reward over the optimal collectable reward under the same candidate. We prove that RRP is NP-hard and inapproximable, and develop $\Psi$-Saturate, a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm that achieves an $\epsilon$-additive approximation by exceeding the budget constraint by a factor that scales as $O(\ln |\Pi|/\epsilon)$. In addition, we present several heuristics, most prominently one inspired by a dynamic programming algorithm for the max-min 0-1 KNAPSACK problem. We corroborate our theoretical analysis with an experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Impact of Heterophilic Structures on Graph Positive-Unlabeled Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning is vital in many real-world scenarios, its application to graph data still remains under-explored. We unveil that a critical challenge for PU learning on graph lies on the edge heterophily, which directly violates the irreducibility assumption for Class-Prior Estimation (class prior is essential for building PU learning algorithms) and degenerates the latent label inference on unlabeled nodes during classifier training. In response to this challenge, we introduce a new method, named Graph PU Learning with Label Propagation Loss (GPL). Specifically, GPL considers learning from PU nodes along with an intermediate heterophily reduction, which helps mitigate the negative impact of the heterophilic structure. We formulate this procedure as a bilevel optimization that reduces heterophily in the inner loop and efficiently learns a classifier in the outer loop. Extensive experiments across a variety of datasets have shown that GPL significantly outperforms baseline methods, confirming its effectiveness and superiority.</description>

      <title>GraphAny: A Foundation Model for Node Classification on Any Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models that can perform inference on any new task without requiring specific training have revolutionized machine learning in vision and language applications. However, applications involving graph-structured data remain a tough nut for foundation models, due to challenges in the unique feature- and label spaces associated with each graph. Traditional graph ML models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on graphs cannot perform inference on a new graph with feature and label spaces different from the training ones. Furthermore, existing models learn functions specific to the training graph and cannot generalize to new graphs. In this work, we tackle these two challenges with a new foundational architecture for inductive node classification named GraphAny. GraphAny models inference on a new graph as an analytical solution to a LinearGNN, thereby solving the first challenge. To solve the second challenge, we learn attention scores for each node to fuse the predictions of multiple LinearGNNs. Specifically, the attention module is carefully parameterized as a function of the entropy-normalized distance-features between multiple LinearGNNs predictions to ensure generalization to new graphs. Empirically, GraphAny trained on the Wisconsin dataset with only 120 labeled nodes can effectively generalize to 30 new graphs with an average accuracy of 67.26\% in an inductive manner, surpassing GCN and GAT trained in the supervised regime, as well as other inductive baselines.</description>
