      <title>An Atomic Cluster Expansion Potential for Twisted Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted multilayer graphene, characterized by its moire patterns arising from inter-layer rotational misalignment, serves as a rich platform for exploring quantum phenomena. While first-principles calculations are computationally prohibitive and empirical interatomic potentials often lack accuracy, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) present a promising alternative, offering (near-)DFT accuracy at a significantly reduced computational cost. Despite their success in two-dimensional monolayer materials, MLIPs remain under-explored in twisted multilayer graphene systems. In this work, we develop an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential for simulating twisted multilayer graphene and test it on a range of simulation tasks. We propose an approach to construct training and test datasets that incorporate all possible twist angles and local stacking, including incommensurate ones. To achieve this, we generate configurations with periodic boundary conditions suitable for DFT calculations, and then introduce an internal twist and shift within those supercell structures. We further refine the dataset through active learning filtering, guided by Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our model is validated for accuracy and robustness through a wide range of numerical tests.</description>

      <title>MOFClassifier: A Machine Learning Approach for Validating Computation-Ready Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational discovery and design of new crystalline materials, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), heavily relies on high-quality, computation-ready structural data. However, recent studies have revealed significant error rates within existing MOF databases, posing a critical data problem that hinders efficient high-throughput computational screening. While rule-based algorithms like MOSAEC, MOFChecker, and the Chen and Manz method (Chen-Manz) have been developed to address this, they often suffer from inherent limitations and misclassification of structures. To overcome this challenge, we introduce MOFClassifier, a novel machine learning approach built upon a positive-unlabeled crystal graph convolutional neural network (PU-CGCNN) model. MOFClassifier learns intricate patterns from perfect crys-tal structures to predict a crystal-likeness score (CLscore), effectively classifying MOFs as computation-ready. Our model achieves a ROC value of 0.979 (previous best 0.912) and, importantly, can identify subtle structural and chemical errors that are fundamentally undetectable by current rule-based methods. By accurately recovering previously misclassified false-negative structures, MOFClassifier reduces the risk of overlooking promising material candidates in large-scale computational screening efforts. This user-friendly tool is freely available and has been integrated into the preparation workflow for the updated CoRE MOF DB 2025 v1, contributing to accelerated computational discovery of MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Understanding multi-fidelity training of machine-learned force-fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively leveraging data from multiple quantum-chemical methods is essential for building machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) that are applicable to a wide range of chemical systems. This study systematically investigates two multi-fidelity training strategies, pre-training/fine-tuning and multi-headed training, to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning their success. We identify key factors driving the efficacy of pre-training followed by fine-tuning, but find that internal representations learned during pre-training are inherently method-specific, requiring adaptation of the model backbone during fine-tuning. Multi-headed models offer an extensible alternative, enabling simultaneous training on multiple fidelities. We demonstrate that a multi-headed model learns method-agnostic representations that allow for accurate predictions across multiple label sources. While this approach introduces a slight accuracy compromise compared to sequential fine-tuning, it unlocks new cost-efficient data generation strategies and paves the way towards developing universal MLFFs.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods rely on the positive definite property of the Euclidean metric, and do not easily extend to the indefinite Minkowski metric. In this paper, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The method we outline is conceptually simple and easily extends to alignment problems in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Computation of Anharmonic Low-Frequency Protein Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At room temperature, low frequency vibrations at far-infrared frequencies are thermally excited ($k_B T &gt; h \nu$) and not restricted to harmonic fluctuations around a single potential energy minimum. For folded proteins, these intrinsically anharmonic vibrations can contain information on slow conformational transitions. Recently, we have developed FREquency-SElective ANharmonic (FRESEAN) mode analysis, a method based on time correlation functions that isolates low-frequency vibrational motions from molecular dynamics simulation trajectories without relying on harmonic approximations. We recently showed that low-frequency vibrations obtained from FRESEAN mode analysis are effective collective variables in enhanced sampling simulations of conformational ensembles. However, FRESEAN mode analysis is based on velocity time correlations between all degrees of freedom, which creates computational challenges for large biomolecules. To facilitate future applications, we demonstrate here how coarse-graining of all-atom simulation trajectories can be combined with FRESEAN mode analysis to extract information on low-frequency vibrations at minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation Framework for Accelerating High-Accuracy Neural Network-Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Learning to Maximize Quantum Neural Network Expressivity via Effective Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ans\"atze for solving variational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance. Yet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge, impeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the effective rank, denoted as $\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of expressivity. Specifically, $\kappa$ captures the number of effectively independent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized quantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to expressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture, input data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that $\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an $n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This result provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and quantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights, and motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design space, we employ $\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of highly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent that autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating theoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes $\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum circuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN architectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Simulation of parametrized cardiac electrophysiology in three dimensions using physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively used to represent various physical systems across multiple scientific domains. The same can be said for cardiac electrophysiology, wherein fully-connected neural networks (FCNNs) have been employed to predict the evolution of an action potential in a 2D space following the two-parameter phenomenological Aliev-Panfilov (AP) model. In this paper, the training behaviour of PINNs is investigated to determine optimal hyperparameters to predict the electrophysiological activity of the myocardium in 3D according to the AP model, with the inclusion of boundary and material parameters. An FCNN architecture is employed with the governing partial differential equations in their strong form, which are scaled consistently with normalization of network inputs. The finite element (FE) method is used to generate training data for the network. Numerical examples with varying spatial dimensions and parameterizations are generated using the trained models. The network predicted fields for both the action potential and the recovery variable are compared with the respective FE simulations. Network losses are weighed with individual scalar values. Their effect on training and prediction is studied to arrive at a method of controlling losses during training.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based prediction of dynamical clustering in granular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When dense granular gases are continuously excited under microgravity conditions, spatial inhomogeneities of the particle number density can emerge. A significant share of particles may collect in strongly overpopulated regions, called clusters. This dynamical clustering, or gas-cluster transition, is caused by a complex interplay and balance between the energy influx and dissipation in particle collisions. Particle number density, container geometry, and excitation strength influence this transition. We perform Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations for ensembles of frictional spheres in a cuboid container and apply the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and a caging criterion to the local packing fraction profiles to detect clusters. Machine learning can be used to study the gas-cluster transition, and can be a promising alternative to identify the state of the system for a given set of system parameters without time-consuming complex DEM simulations. We test various machine learning models and identify the best models to predict dynamical clustering of frictional spheres in a specific experimental geometry.</description>

      <title>Randomised composite linear-combination-of-unitaries: its role in quantum simulation and observable estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomisation is widely used in quantum algorithms to reduce the number of quantum gates and ancillary qubits required. A range of randomised algorithms, including eigenstate property estimation by spectral filters, Hamiltonian simulation, and perturbative quantum simulation, though motivated and designed for different applications, share common features in the use of unitary decomposition and Hadamard-test-based implementation. In this work, we start by analysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in quantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the randomised composite LCU. A caveat of randomisation, however, is that the resulting state cannot be deterministically prepared, which often takes an unphysical form $U \rho V^\dagger$ with unitaries $U$ and $V$. Therefore, randomised LCU algorithms are typically restricted to only estimating the expectation value of a single Pauli operator. To address this, we introduce a quantum instrument that can realise a non-completely-positive map, whose feature of frequent measurement and reset on the ancilla makes it particularly suitable in the fault-tolerant regime. We then show how to construct an unbiased estimator of the effective (unphysical) state $U \rho V^\dagger$ and its generalisation. Moreover, we demonstrate how to effectively realise the state prepared by applying an operator that admits a composite LCU form. Our results reveal a natural connection between randomised LCU algorithms and shadow tomography, thereby allowing simultaneous estimation of many observables efficiently. As a concrete example, we construct the estimators and present the simulation complexity for three use cases of randomised LCU in Hamiltonian simulation and eigenstate preparation tasks.</description>

Abstract: Many areas of science and engineering encounter data defined on spherical manifolds. Modelling and analysis of spherical data often necessitates spherical harmonic transforms, at high degrees, and increasingly requires efficient computation of gradients for machine learning or other differentiable programming tasks. We develop novel algorithmic structures for accelerated and differentiable computation of generalised Fourier transforms on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ and rotation group $\text{SO}(3)$, i.e. spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms, respectively. We present a recursive algorithm for the calculation of Wigner $d$-functions that is both stable to high harmonic degrees and extremely parallelisable. By tightly coupling this with separable spherical transforms, we obtain algorithms that exhibit an extremely parallelisable structure that is well-suited for the high throughput computing of modern hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs). We also develop a hybrid automatic and manual differentiation approach so that gradients can be computed efficiently. Our algorithms are implemented within the JAX differentiable programming framework in the S2FFT software code. Numerous samplings of the sphere are supported, including equiangular and HEALPix sampling. Computational errors are at the order of machine precision for spherical samplings that admit a sampling theorem. When benchmarked against alternative C codes we observe up to a 400-fold acceleration. Furthermore, when distributing over multiple GPUs we achieve very close to optimal linear scaling with increasing number of GPUs due to the highly parallelised and balanced nature of our algorithms. Provided access to sufficiently many GPUs our transforms thus exhibit an unprecedented effective linear time complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07038v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Multi-scale Boltzmann Equation (MBE) is found from the gas-kinetic theory and the direct modeling philosophy as a master equation for complex physical systems of neutral gases across all flow regimes, which locates between the continuum limit and the free-molecular limit, covering a vast range of applications such as hypersonic flows over aerospace crafts and delicate flows around MEMS. The most explicit characteristic of MBE is evolving the variable observation time in the expression, which distinguishes the MBE from the single-scale master or governing equation where a fixed scale is implied in the assumptions. The fundamental properties of MBE, such as the asymptotic property, are proved theoretically, while a concise numerical scheme is developed for MBE to demonstrate its validity by benchmark multi-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Shooting Point Monte Carlo Methods for Transition Path Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare event sampling algorithms are essential for understanding processes that occur infrequently on the molecular scale, yet they are important for the long-time dynamics of complex molecular systems. One of these algorithms, transition path sampling (TPS), has become a standard technique to study such rare processes since no prior knowledge on the transition region is required. Most TPS methods generate new trajectories from old trajectories by selecting a point along the old trajectory, modifying its momentum in some way, and then ``shooting'' a new trajectory by integrating forward and backward in time. In some procedures, the shooting point is selected independently for each trial move, but in others, the shooting point evolves from one path to the next so that successive shooting points are related to each other. To account for this memory effect, we introduce a theoretical framework based on an extended ensemble that includes both paths and shooting indices. We derive appropriate acceptance rules for various path sampling algorithms in this extended formalism, ensuring the correct sampling of the transition path ensemble. Our framework reveals the need for amended acceptance criteria in the flexible-length aimless shooting and spring shooting methods.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a generalized, assumption-free, and stencil-independent theoretical analyses of the recently proposed Onsager-Regularized (OReg) lattice Boltzmann (LB) method [Jonnalagadda et al., Phys. Rev. E 104, 015313 (2021)] and demonstrates its ability to mitigate spurious errors associated with the insufficient isotropy of standard first-neighbor lattices without the inclusion of any external correction terms. The hydrodynamic limit recovered by the OReg scheme is derived for two equilibrium distribution functions, namely the so-called thermal guided equilibrium and the popular second order polynomial equilibrium, to show that the OReg scheme yields macroscopic dynamics that are O(u) times more accurate than that of the bare BGK collision model. Specifically, we show that, with the guided equilibrium on the D2Q9 standard lattice, the OReg scheme inherently compensates for the insufficient lattice isotropy of the standard D2Q9 lattice by automatically adjusting the lattice viscosity, yielding O(u4) and O(u2) accurate kinetic models when operated at the reference and arbitrary temperatures respectively. Further, we also show that the OReg scheme presents an O(u3) accurate kinetic model for the D2Q9 lattice when used with the second order polynomial equilibrium formulation. Thereafter, the accuracy of the OReg-guided-equilibrium kinetic model is numerically demonstrated for quasi-one-dimensional simulations of the rotated decaying shear wave and isothermal shocktube problems. The present work lays the theoretical foundation of a generic framework which can enable fully local, correction-free, nonlinear thermohydrodynamic LB simulations on standard lattices, thereby facilitating scalable simulations of physically challenging fluid flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present qlbm, a Python software package designed to facilitate the development, simulation, and analysis of Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Methods (QBMs). qlbm is a modular framework that introduces a quantum component abstraction hierarchy tailored to the implementation of novel QBMs. The framework interfaces with state-of-the-art quantum software infrastructure to enable efficient simulation and validation pipelines, and leverages novel execution and pre-processing techniques that significantly reduce the computational resources required to develop quantum circuits. We demonstrate the versatility of the software by showcasing multiple QBMs in 2D and 3D with complex boundary conditions, integrated within automated benchmarking utilities. Accompanying the source code are extensive test suites, thorough online documentation resources, analysis tools, visualization methods, and demos that aim to increase the accessibility of QBMs while encouraging reproducibility and collaboration. The source code of qlbm is publicly available under a permissive MPL 2.0 license at https://github.com/QCFD-Lab/qlbm.</description>

      <title>Entropy conservative and entropy stable solid wall boundary conditions for the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for imposing non-linear entropy conservative and entropy stable wall boundary conditions for the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations in the presence of an adiabatic wall or a wall with a prescribed heat entropy flow, addressing three scenarios: electrically insulating walls, thin walls with finite conductivity, and perfectly conducting walls. The procedure relies on the formalism and mimetic properties of diagonal-norm, summation-by-parts, and simultaneous-approximation-term operators. Using the method of lines, a semi-discrete entropy estimate for the entire domain is obtained when the proposed numerical imposition of boundary conditions is coupled with an entropy-conservative or entropy-stable discrete interior operator. The resulting estimate mimics the global entropy estimate obtained at the continuous level. The boundary data at the wall are weakly imposed using a penalty flux approach and a simultaneous-approximation-term technique for both the conservative variables and the gradient of the entropy variables. Discontinuous spectral collocation operators (mass lumped nodal discontinuous Galerkin operators) on high-order unstructured grids are used to demonstrate the new procedure's accuracy, robustness, and efficacy for weakly enforcing boundary conditions. Numerical simulations confirm the non-linear stability of the proposed technique, with applications to three-dimensional flows. The procedure described is compatible with any diagonal-norm summation-by-parts spatial operator, including finite element, finite difference, finite volume, nodal and modal discontinuous Galerkin, and flux reconstruction schemes.</description>

      <title>Fully Quantum Lattice Gas Automata Building Blocks for Computational Basis State Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice Gas Automata (LGA) is a classical method for simulating physical phenomena, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Quantum LGA (QLGA) is the family of methods that implement LGA schemes on quantum computers. In recent years, QLGA has garnered attention from researchers thanks to its potential of efficiently modeling CFD processes by either reducing memory requirements or providing simultaneous representations of exponentially many LGA states. In this work, we introduce novel building blocks for QLGA algorithms that rely on computational basis state encodings. We address every step of the algorithm, from initial conditions to measurement, and provide detailed complexity analyses that account for all discretization choices of the system under simulation. We introduce multiple ways of instantiating initial conditions, efficient boundary condition implementations for novel geometrical patterns, a novel collision operator that models less restricted interactions than previous implementations, and quantum circuits that extract quantities of interest out of the quantum state. For each building block, we provide intuitive examples and open-source implementations of the underlying quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Higher-Oder Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. The DG discretization of the adapted second-order viscous terms is carried out via the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method, obviating auxiliary variables. Based on this spatial discretization, we compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) a higher-order DG discretization for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, ii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iii) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>
