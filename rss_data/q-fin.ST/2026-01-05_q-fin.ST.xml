      <title>Ultimate Forward Rate Prediction and its Application to Bond Yield Forecasting: A Machine Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on forecasting the ultimate forward rate (UFR) and developing a UFRbased bond yield prediction model using data from Chinese treasury bonds and macroeconomic variables spanning from December 2009 to December 2024. The de Kort-Vellekooptype methodology is applied to estimate the UFR, incorporating the optimal turning parameter determination technique proposed in this study, which helps mitigate anomalous fluctuations. In addition, both linear and nonlinear machine learning techniques are employed to forecast the UFR and ultra-long-term bond yields. The results indicate that nonlinear machine learning models outperform their linear counterparts in forecasting accuracy. Incorporating macroeconomic variables, particularly price index-related variables, significantly improves the accuracy of predictions. Finally, a novel UFR-based bond yield forecasting model is developed, demonstrating superior performance across different bond maturities.</description>

      <title>Core-Periphery Dynamics in Market-Conditioned Financial Networks: A Conditional P-Threshold Mutual Information Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how financial market structure reorganizes during the COVID-19 crash using a conditional p-threshold mutual information (MI) based Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) framework. We analyze nonlinear dependencies among the largest stocks from four diverse QUAD countries: the US, Japan, Australia, and India. Crashes are identified using the Hellinger distance and Hilbert spectrum; a crash occurs when HD = mu\_H + 2*sigma\_H, segmenting data into pre-crash, crash, and post-crash periods. Conditional p-threshold MI filters out common market effects and applies permutation-based significance testing. Resulting validated dependencies are used to construct MST networks for comparison across periods. Networks become more integrated during the crash, with shorter path lengths, higher centrality, and lower algebraic connectivity, indicating fragility. Core-periphery structure declines, with increased periphery vulnerability, and disassortative mixing facilitates shock transmission. Post-crash networks show only partial recovery. Aftershock analysis using the Gutenberg-Richter law indicates higher relative frequency of large volatility events following the crash. Results are consistent across all markets, highlighting the conditional p-threshold MI framework for capturing nonlinear interdependencies and systemic vulnerability.</description>

      <title>A Midsummer Meme's Dream: Investigating Market Manipulations in the Meme Coin Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From viral jokes to a billion-dollar phenomenon, meme coins have become one of the most popular segments in cryptocurrency markets. Unlike utility-focused crypto assets like Bitcoin, meme coins derive value primarily from community sentiment, making them vulnerable to manipulation. This study presents an unprecedented cross-chain analysis of the meme coin ecosystem, examining 34,988 tokens across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. We characterize their tokenomics and track their growth in a three-month longitudinal analysis. We discover that among high-return tokens (&gt;100%), an alarming 82.8% show evidence of artificial growth strategies designed to create a misleading appearance of market interest. These include wash trading and a new form of manipulation we define as Liquidity Pool-Based Price Inflation (LPI), where small strategic purchases trigger dramatic price increases. We find that profit extraction schemes, such as pump and dumps and rug pulls, typically follow initial manipulations like wash trading or LPI, indicating how early manipulations create the foundation for later exploitation. We quantify the economic impact of these schemes, identifying over 17,000 victimized addresses with realized losses exceeding $9.3 million. These findings reveal that combined manipulations are widespread among high-performing meme coins, suggesting that their dramatic gains are often driven by coordinated efforts rather than natural market dynamics.</description>
