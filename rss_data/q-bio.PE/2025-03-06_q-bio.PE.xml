      <title>Optimal virulence strategies in epidemiological models with asymptomatic transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptomatic infection has gained notoriety as an important feature of infectious disease dynamics. Despite increasing attention, there have been few rigorous examinations of how asymptomatic transmission influences pathogen evolution. In this study, we apply evolutionary invasion analysis to compute optimal strategies for viruses evolving in a system with a distinct asymptomatic transmission stage. We ask how pathogens would evolve under three conditions: with an increase in the mean infectious period in the symptomatic state, with an increase in the mean infectious period in the asymptomatic stage, and an increase in proportion proceeding through the ``mild recovery route" (where the symptomatic state was bypassed entirely). We find that an increased proportion of cases moving through a ``mild recovery route" -- which can occur with different host susceptibility or increased public health intervention -- leads to a model structure in which mutant pathogens are transmitted largely through the asymptomatic route, with slightly increased evolved virulence levels. In addition, we find that an increase in the mean infectious period of the symptomatic state has a small overall influence on the fitness of the pathogen, when effective transmission can occur via the asymptomatic route. Further, we find that virulence levels change very slightly for both the asymptomatic and symptomatic populations. In sum, our results highlight the evolutionary implications of variation in host susceptibility and public health interventions in the context of asymptomatic transmission. More generally, the findings speak to the need for more nuanced interrogations of subtle routes of transmission, as they can have profound implications in disease evolution, ecology, and epidemiology.</description>

      <title>An SIRS model with hospitalizations: economic impact by disease severity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-timescale SIRS-type model in which a fraction $\theta$ of infected individuals experiences a severe course of the disease, requiring hospitalization. During hospitalization, these individuals do not contribute to further infections. We analyze the model's equilibria, perform a bifurcation analysis, and explore its two-timescale nature (using techniques from Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory). Our main result provides an explicit expression for the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the total number of hospitalized individuals for long times, revealing that this optimal fraction can be lower than 1. This highlights the interesting effect that a severe disease, by necessitating widespread hospitalization, can indirectly suppress contagions and, consequently, reduce hospitalizations. Numerical simulations illustrate the growth in the number of hospitalizations for short times. The model can also be interpreted as a scenario where only a fraction $\theta$ of infected individuals develops symptoms and self-quarantines.</description>

      <title>Epidemic-induced local awareness behavior inferred from surveys and genetic sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior-disease models suggest that pandemics can be contained cost-effectively if individuals take preventive actions when disease prevalence rises among their close contacts. However, assessing local awareness behavior in real-world datasets remains a challenge. Through the analysis of mutation patterns in clinical genetic sequence data, we propose an efficient approach to quantify the impact of local awareness by identifying superspreading events and assigning containment scores to them.
  We validate the proposed containment score as a proxy for local awareness in simulation experiments, and find that it was correlated positively with policy stringency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we observe a temporary drop in the containment score during the Omicron wave in the United Kingdom, matching a survey experiment we carried out in Hungary during the corresponding period of the pandemic. Our findings bring important insight into the field of awareness modeling through the analysis of large-scale genetic sequence data, one of the most promising data sources in epidemics research.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Trade-off between Infections and Social Interactions Using a Compact Model of Endemic Infections on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many epidemiological and ecological contexts, there is a trade-off between infections and interactions. This arises because the links between individuals capable of spreading infections are also often associated with beneficial activities. Here, we consider how the presence of explicit network structure changes the optimal solution of a class of infection-interaction trade-offs. In order to do this, we develop and analyse a low-dimensional dynamical system approximating the network SIS epidemic. We find that network structure in the form of heterogeneous numbers of contacts can have a significant impact on the optimal number of contacts that comes out of a trade-off model.</description>
