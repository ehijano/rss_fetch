      <title>Applications of the quaternionic Jordan form to hypercomplex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the quaternionic Jordan form to classify the hypercomplex nilpotent almost abelian Lie algebras in all dimensions and to carry out the complete classification of 12-dimensional hypercomplex almost abelian Lie algebras. Moreover, we determine which 12-dimensional simply connected hypercomplex almost abelian Lie groups admit lattices. Finally, for each integer $n&gt;1$ we construct infinitely many, up to diffeomorphism, $(4n+4)$-dimensional hypercomplex almost abelian solvmanifolds which are completely solvable. These solvmanifolds arise from a distinguished family of monic integer polynomials of degree $n$.</description>

      <title>Any K\"ahler metric is a Fisher information metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fisher information metric or the Fisher-Rao metric corresponds to a natural Riemannian metric defined on a parameterized family of probability density functions. As in the case of Riemannian geometry, we can define a distance in terms of the Fisher information metric, called the Fisher-Rao distance. The Fisher information metric has a wide range of applications in estimation and information theories. Indeed, it provides the most informative Cramer-Rao bound for an unbiased estimator. The Goldberg conjecture is a well-known unsolved problem which states that any compact Einstein almost K\"ahler manifold is necessarily a K\"ahler-Einstein. Note that, there is also a known odd-dimensional analog of the Goldberg conjecture in the literature. The main objective of this paper is to establish a new characterization of coK\"ahler manifolds and K\"ahler manifolds; our characterization is statistical in nature. Finally, we corroborate that every, K\"ahler and co-K\"ahler manifolds, can be viewed as being a parametric family of probability density functions, whereas K\"ahler and coK\"ahler metrics can be regarded as Fisher information metrics. In particular, we prove that, when the K\"ahler metric is real analytic, it is always locally the Fisher information of an exponential family. We also tackle the link between K\"ahler potential and Kullback-Leibler divergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following \L ojasiewicz's uniqueness theorem and Thom's gradient conjecture, Arnold proposed a stronger version about the existence of limit tangents of gradient flow lines for analytic functions. We prove \L ojasiewicz's theorem and Arnold's conjecture in the context of arrival time functions for mean curvature flows in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ with neck or non-degenerate cylindrical singularities. In particular, we prove the conjectures for all mean convex mean curvature flows of surfaces, including the cases when the arrival time functions are not $C^2.$ The results also apply to mean curvature flows starting from two-spheres or generic closed surfaces.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e inequality for one forms on four manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we provide a quantitative global Poincar\'e inequality for one forms on a closed Riemannian four manifold, in terms of an upper bound on the diameter, a positive lower bound on the volume, and a two-sided bound on Ricci curvature. This seems to be the first non-trivial result giving such an inequality without any higher curvature assumptions. The proof is based on a Hodge theoretic result on orbifolds, a comparison for fundamental groups, and a spectral convergence with respect to Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, via a degeneration result to orbifolds by Anderson.</description>

      <title>On geometric invariants of singular plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a germ of a smooth plane curve $(\{f(x,y)=0\},0)\subset (\mathbb K^2,0), \mathbb K=\mathbb R, \mathbb C$, with an isolated singularity, we define two invariants $I_f$ and $V_f\in \mathbb N\cup\{\infty\}$ which count the number of inflections and vertices (suitably interpreted in the complex case) concentrated at the singular point; the first is an affine invariant and the second is invariant under similarities of $\mathbb R^2$, and their analogue for $\mathbb C^2$. We show that for almost all representations of $f$, in the sense that their complement is of infinite codimension, these invariants are finite. Indeed when the curve has no smooth components they are always finite and bounded and we can be much more explicit about the values they can attain; the set of possible values is of course an analytic invariant of $f$. We illustrate our results by computing these invariants for Arnold's $\mathcal K$-simple singularities as well as singularities that have ${\mathcal A}$-simple parametrisations. We also obtain a relationship between these invariants, the Milnor number of $f$ and the contact of the curve germ with its osculating circle.</description>

Abstract: Constant rank theorems are obtained for saddle solutions to the special Lagrangian equation and the quadratic Hessian equation. The argument also leads to Liouville type results for the special Lagrangian equation with subcritical phase, matching the known rigidity results for semiconvex entire solutions to the quadratic Hessian equation.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian metric geometry with Riemannian bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study collections of exact Lagrangian submanifolds respecting some uniform Riemannian bounds, which we equip with a metric naturally arising in symplectic topology (e.g. the Lagrangian Hofer metric or the spectral metric). We exhibit many metric and symplectic properties of these spaces, such that they have compact completions and that they contain only finitely many Hamiltonian isotopy classes. We then use this to exclude many unusual phenomena from happening in these bounded spaces. Taking limits in the bounds, we also conclude that there are at most countably many Hamiltonian isotopy classes of exact Lagrangian submanifolds in a Liouville manifold. Under some mild topological assumptions, we get analogous results for monotone Lagrangian submanifolds with a fixed monotonicity constant. Finally, in the process of showing these results, we get new results on the Riemannian geometry of cotangent bundles and surfaces which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Parametric satellites and connected-sums in the space of Legendrian embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces two new constructions at the higher homotopy level in the space of Legendrian embeddings in $(\mathbb{R}^3, \xi_{\operatorname{std}})$. We first introduce the parametric Legendrian satellite construction, showing that the satellite operation works for parametric families of Legendrian embeddings. This yields new invariants at the higher-order homotopy level.
  We then introduce the parametric connected-sum construction. This operation takes as inputs two $n$-spheres based at Legendrian embeddings $K_1$ and $K_2$, respectively, and produces a new $n$-sphere based at $K_1\# K_2$. As a main application we construct new infinite families of loops of Legendrian embeddings with non-trivial LCH monodromy invariant.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of isoperimetric sets in spaces of positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every $d\ge 3$, we construct a noncompact smooth $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with strictly positive sectional curvature without isoperimetric sets for any volume below $1$. We construct a similar example also for the relative isoperimetric problem in (unbounded) convex sets in $\mathbb R^d$. The examples we construct have nondegenerate asymptotic cone.
  The dimensional constraint $d\ge 3$ is sharp. Our examples exhibit nonexistence of isoperimetric sets only for small volumes; indeed in nonnegatively curved spaces with nondegenerate asymptotic cones isoperimetric sets with large volumes always exist.
  This is the first instance of noncollapsed nonnegatively curved space without isoperimetric sets.</description>

      <title>On Vafa-Witten equations over Kaehler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the analytic properties of solutions to the Vafa-Witten equation over a compact Kaehler manifold. Simple obstructions to the existence of nontrivial solutions are identified. The gauge theoretical compactness for the $\mathbb{C}^*$ invariant locus of the moduli space is shown to behave similarly as the Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections. More generally, this holds for solutions with uniformly bounded spectral covers such as nilpotent solutions. When spectral covers are unbounded, we manage to take limits of the renormalized Higgs fields which are intrinsically characterized by the convergence of the associated spectral covers. This gives a simpler proof for Taubes' results on rank two solutions over Kaehler surfaces together with a new complex geometric interpretation. The moduli space of $SU(2)$ monopoles and some related examples are also discussed in the final section.</description>

      <title>Finite generation of fundamental groups for manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature whose universal cover is almost $k$-polar at infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that the fundamental group $\pi_1(M)$ of a complete open manifold $M$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature is finitely generated, under the condition that the Riemannian universal cover $\tilde M$ satisfies an "almost $k$-polar at infinity" condition. Additionally, such $\pi_1(M)$ is virtually abelian. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the base point of any tangent cone at infinity of such a manifold is nearly a pole. In the case where $\tilde M$ exhibits almost maximal Euclidean volume growth, we prove that $M$ deformation retracts to a closed submanifold $F$ which is diffeomorphic to a flat manifold, provided $M$ is not simply connected.</description>

      <title>Anyonic Topological Order in Twisted Equivariant Differential (TED) K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the classification of non-interacting crystalline topological insulator phases by equivariant K-theory has become widely accepted, its generalization to anyonic interacting phases -- hence to phases with topologically ordered ground states supporting topological braid quantum gates -- has remained wide open. On the contrary, the success of K-theory with classifying non-interacting phases seems to have tacitly been perceived as precluding a K-theoretic classification of interacting topological order; and instead a mix of other proposals has been explored. However, only K-theory connects closely to the actual physics of valence electrons; and self-consistency demands that any other proposal must connect to K-theory.
  Here we provide a detailed argument for the classification of symmetry protected/enhanced su(2)-anyonic topological order, specifically in interacting 2d semi-metals, by the twisted equivariant differential (TED) K-theory of configuration spaces of points in the complement of nodal points inside the crystal's Brillouin torus orbi-orientifold.
  We argue, in particular, that: (1) topological 2d semi-metal phases modulo global mass terms are classified by the flat differential twisted equivariant K-theory of the complement of the nodal points; (2) n-electron interacting phases are classified by the K-theory of configuration spaces of n points in the Brillouin torus; (3) the somewhat neglected twisting of equivariant K-theory by "inner local systems" reflects the effective "fictitious" gauge interaction of Chen, Wilczeck, Witten &amp; Halperin (1989), which turns fermions into anyonic quanta; (4) the induced su(2)-anyonic topological order is reflected in the twisted Chern classes of the interacting valence bundle over configuration space, constituting the hypergeometric integral construction of monodromy braid representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09350v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The homology of the free and the based loop space of a compact globally symmetric space can be studied through explicit cycles. We use cycles constructed by Bott and Samelson and by Ziller to study the string topology coproduct and the Chas-Sullivan product on compact symmetric spaces. We show that the Chas-Sullivan product for compact symmetric spaces is highly non-trivial for any rank and we prove that there are many non-nilpotent classes whose powers correspond to the iteration of closed geodesics. Moreover, we show that the based string topology coproduct is trivial for compact symmetric spaces of higher rank and we study the implications of this result for the string topology coproduct on the free loop space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16995v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new notion of singularity in General Relativity which complements the usual notions of geodesic incompleteness and curvature singularities. Concretely, we say that a spacetime has a volume singularity if there exist points whose future or past has arbitrarily small spacetime volume: in particular, smaller than a Planck volume. From a cosmological perspective, we show that the (geodesic) singularities predicted by Hawking's theorem are also volume singularities. In the black hole setting, we show that volume singularities are always hidden by an event horizon, prompting a discussion of Penrose's cosmic censorship conjecture.</description>

      <title>Almost holomorphic curves in real analytic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the theory of exterior differential systems, we study the existence of germ of pseudo-holomorphic disk in a real analytic hypersurface locally defined in a complex manifold equipped with J a real analytic almost complex structure. The integrable case in C n with J the multiplication by i has been intensively studied by several authors [DF], [DA1] and [DA2] for example. The non integrable case is drastically different essentially due to the following fact : in generic case, there is no J-invariant objects of dimension bigger than one. This simple observation leads to the non existence of some equivalents of Segree varieties or ideals of holomorphic functions which play a fundamental role in the complex case. Nevertheless in the almost complex case, we adopt the exterior differential system point of view of E.Cartan developed and clarified in [BCGGG].</description>
