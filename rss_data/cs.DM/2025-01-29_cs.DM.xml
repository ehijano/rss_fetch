      <title>Ancilla-free Quantum Adder with Sublinear Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first exact quantum adder with sublinear depth and no ancilla qubits. Our construction is based on classical reversible logic only and employs low-depth implementations for the CNOT ladder operator and the Toffoli ladder operator, two key components to perform ripple-carry addition. Namely, we demonstrate that any ladder of $n$ CNOT gates can be replaced by a CNOT-circuit with $O(\log n)$ depth, while maintaining a linear number of gates. We then generalize this construction to Toffoli gates and demonstrate that any ladder of $n$ Toffoli gates can be substituted with a circuit with $O(\log^2 n)$ depth while utilizing a linearithmic number of gates. This builds on the recent works of Nie et al. and Khattar and Gidney on the technique of conditionally clean ancillae. By combining these two key elements, we present a novel approach to design quantum adders that can perform the addition of two $n$-bit numbers in depth $O(\log^2 n)$ without the use of any ancilla and using classical reversible logic only (Toffoli, CNOT and X gates).</description>

      <title>Pessimistic bilevel optimization approach for decision-focused learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent interest in contextual optimization problems, where randomness is associated with side information, has led to two primary strategies for formulation and solution. The first, estimate-then-optimize, separates the estimation of the problem's parameters from the optimization process. The second, decision-focused optimization, integrates the optimization problem's structure directly into the prediction procedure. In this work, we propose a pessimistic bilevel approach for solving general decision-focused formulations of combinatorial optimization problems. Our method solves an $\varepsilon$-approximation of the pessimistic bilevel problem using a specialized cut generation algorithm. We benchmark its performance on the 0-1 knapsack problem against estimate-then-optimize and decision-focused methods, including the popular SPO+ approach. Computational experiments highlight the proposed method's advantages, particularly in reducing out-of-sample regret.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Transitively Orienting Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a temporal network with discrete time-labels on its edges, entities and information can only ``flow'' along sequences of edges whose time-labels are non-decreasing (resp. increasing), i.e. along temporal (resp. strict temporal) paths. Nevertheless, in the model for temporal networks of [Kempe, Kleinberg, Kumar, JCSS, 2002], the individual time-labeled edges remain undirected: an edge $e=\{u,v\}$ with time-label $t$ specifies that ``$u$ communicates with $v$ at time $t$''.
  In this paper we make a first attempt to understand how the direction of information flow on one edge can impact the direction of information flow on other edges. More specifically, naturally extending the classical notion of a transitive orientation in static graphs, we introduce the fundamental notion of a temporal transitive orientation and we systematically investigate its algorithmic behavior. An orientation of a temporal graph is called temporally transitive if, whenever $u$ has a directed edge towards $v$ with time-label $t_1$ and $v$ has a directed edge towards $w$ with time-label $t_2\geq t_1$, then $u$ also has a directed edge towards $w$ with some time-label $t_3\geq t_2$. If we just demand that this implication holds whenever $t_2 &gt; t_1$, we call the orientation strictly temporally transitive, as it is based on the strict directed temporal path from $u$ to $w$.
  Our main result is a conceptually simple, yet technically quite involved, polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a given temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is transitively orientable. In wide contrast we prove that, surprisingly, it is NP-hard to recognize whether $\mathcal{G}$ is strictly transitively orientable. Additionally we introduce and investigate further related problems to temporal transitivity, notably among them the temporal transitive completion problem, for which we prove both algorithmic and hardness results.</description>

      <title>Differential Tree Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rationally dynamically algebraic (RDA) power series is one that arises as (a component of) the solution of a system of differential equations of the form $\boldsymbol{y}' = F(\boldsymbol{y})$, where $F$ is a vector of rational functions that is defined at $\boldsymbol{y}(0)$. RDA power series subsume algebraic power series and are a proper subclass of differentially algebraic power series (those that satisfy a univariate polynomial-differential equation). We give a combinatorial characterisation of RDA power series in terms of exponential generating functions of regular languages of labelled trees. Motivated by this connection, we define the notion of a differential tree automaton. Differential tree automata generalise weighted tree automata by allowing the transition weights to be rational functions of the tree size. Our main result is that the ordinary generating functions of the formal tree series recognised by differential tree automata are exactly the differentially algebraic power series. The proof of this result establishes a general form of recurrence satisfied by the sequence of coefficients of a differentially algebraic power series, generalising Reutenauer's matrix representation of polynomially recursive sequences. As a corollary we obtain a procedure for determining equality of differential tree automata.</description>

      <title>Fortifying Critical Infrastructure Networks with Multicriteria Portfolio Decision Analysis: An Application to Railway Stations in Finland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced societies are crucially dependent on critical infrastructure networks for the reliable delivery of essential goods and services. Hence, well-founded analyses concerning disruptions are needed to guide decisions that seek to ensure the performance of these networks in the face of failures caused by vulnerabilities to external hazards or technical malfunctions. In this setting, we develop an approach based on multicriteria decision analysis to support the identification of cost-efficient portfolios of preventive fortification actions. Our approach (i) allows for multiple objectives, such as those that represent the traffic volume that is enabled between alternative origin-destination pairs in a transportation network, (ii) uses methods of probabilistic risk assessment to quantify the expected performance of the network, and (iii) uses a search algorithm combined with an optimization model to identify those combinations of fortification actions that are cost-efficient in improving the performance of the network, given the available, possibly incomplete information about the relative importance of objectives and minimum performance requirements on them. Our methodological contributions are illustrated by a case study on the analysis of railway switches at a representative Finnish railway station.</description>

      <title>Degree Realization by Bipartite Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of realizing a given degree sequence by a multigraph can be thought of as a relaxation of the classical degree realization problem (where the realizing graph is simple). This paper concerns the case where the realizing multigraph is required to be bipartite.
  The problem of characterizing sequences that can be realized by a bipartite graph has two variants. In the simpler one, termed BDR$^P$, the partition of the sequence into two sides is given as part of the input. A complete characterization for realizability in this variant was given by Gale and Ryser over sixty years ago. However, the variant where the partition is not given, termed BDR, is still open.
  For bipartite multigraph realizations, there are also two variants. For BDR$^P$, where the partition is given as part of the input, a characterization was known for determining whether there is a multigraph realization whose underlying graph is bipartite, such that the maximum number of copies of an edge is at most $r$. We present a characterization for determining if there is a bipartite multigraph realization such that the total number of excess edges is at most $t$. We show that optimizing these two measures may lead to different realizations, and that optimizing by one measure may increase the other substantially. As for the variant BDR, where the partition is not given, we show that determining whether a given (single) sequence admits a bipartite multigraph realization is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that this hardness result extends to any graph family which is a sub-family of bipartite graphs and a super-family of paths. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal realizations for the case where the number of balanced partitions is polynomial, and present sufficient conditions for the existence of bipartite multigraph realizations that depend only on the largest degree of the sequence.</description>
