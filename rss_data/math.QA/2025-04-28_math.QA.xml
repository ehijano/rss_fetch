      <title>The quantum $\epsilon$lectrical Hopf algebra and categorification of Fock space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduce a generalization of the Khovanov--Lauda Rouquier algebras, the electric KLR algebras.
  These are superalgebras which connect to super Brauer algebras in the same way as ordinary KLR-algebras of type $A$ connect to symmetric group algebras. As super Brauer algebras are in Schur--Weyl duality with the periplectic Lie superalgebras, the new algebras describe morphisms between refined translation functors for this least understood family of classical Lie superalgebras with reductive even part.
  The electric KLR algebras are different from quiver Hecke superalgebras introduced by Kang--Kashiwara--Tsuchioka and do not categorify quantum groups. We show that they categorify a quantum version of a type $A$ electric Lie algebra.
  The electrical Lie algebras arose from the study of electrical networks. They recently appeared in the mathematical literature as Lie algebras of a new kind of electric Lie groups introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy.
  We give a definition of a quantum electric algebra and realise it as a coideal subalgebra in some quantum group.
  We finally prove several categorification theorems: most prominently we use cyclotomic quotients of electric KLR algebras to categorify higher level Fock spaces.</description>

      <title>SymTFT, Protected Gaplessness, and Spontaneous Breaking of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18501v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years we have learned that several four-dimensional field theories can manifest non-invertible zero-form symmetries generalizing the Kramers-Wannier duality defect of the 2d critical Ising model. Several recent works by various groups have observed a deep interplay among such non-invertible symmetries in 3+1 dimensions, their anomalies, and the properties of the ground state(s). The purpose of this work is to present a first coarse classification of all possible classes of non-invertible symmetries of this type that can either enforce gaplessness or be spontaneously broken in the infrared exploiting the topological symmetry theory formalism. Our methods also generalize to non-invertible KW-like duality symmetries graded by non-abelian finite subgroups. As a first applications of our results we present examples in the context of supersymmetric models. Along the way we notice the potential for further global structures that could be realized by non-SUSY versions of Argyres-Douglas type fixed points.</description>

      <title>(Co)module algebras and their generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.09810v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript is an extended version of the author's habilitation thesis defended on May 21, 2021 at M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University. It is devoted to the study of (co)stability of radicals, existence of (co)invariant Levi and Wedderburn decompositions, structure of the corresponding simple algebras and codimension growth of polynomial identities in (co)module algebras over bi- and Hopf algebras and their generalizations. The main difference between this manuscript and the "official" thesis are additional chapters dealing with equivalences of gradings and Hopf algebra (co)actions, V-universal (co)acting bi- and Hopf algebras and related categorical questions.

      <title>$A_\infty$-deformations of zigzag algebras via Ginzburg dg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note aims to give a short proof of the recent result due to Etg\"u-Lekili (2017) and Lekili-Ueda (2021): the zigzag algebra of any finite tree over a field of characteristic 0 is intrinsically formal if and only if the tree is of type ADE. We also complete the proof of this result by considering a field of arbitrary characteristic for type E, which was still open.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>
