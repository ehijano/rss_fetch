      <title>A Cone-preserving Solution to a Nonsymmetric Riccati Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the following simple equivalent condition for a nonsymmetric Algebraic Riccati Equation to admit a stabilizing cone-preserving solution: an associated coefficient matrix must be stable. The result holds under the assumption that said matrix be cross-positive on a proper cone, and it both extends and completes a corresponding sufficient condition for nonnegative matrices in the literature. Further, key to showing the above is the following result which we also provide: in order for a monotonically increasing sequence of cone-preserving matrices to converge, it is sufficient to be bounded above in a single vectorial direction.</description>

      <title>Scenario Tree Reduction via Wasserstein Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scenario tree reduction techniques are essential for achieving a balance between an accurate representation of uncertainties and computational complexity when solving multistage stochastic programming problems. In the realm of available techniques, the Kovacevic and Pichler algorithm (Ann. Oper. Res., 2015 [1]) stands out for employing the nested distance, a metric for comparing multistage scenario trees. However, dealing with large-scale scenario trees can lead to a prohibitive computational burden due to the algorithm's requirement of solving several large-scale linear problems per iteration. This study concentrates on efficient approaches to solving such linear problems, recognizing that their solutions are Wasserstein barycenters of the tree nodes' probabilities on a given stage. We leverage advanced optimal transport techniques to compute Wasserstein barycenters and significantly improve the computational performance of the Kovacevic and Pichler algorithm. Our boosted variants of this algorithm are benchmarked on several multistage scenario trees. Our experiments show that compared to the original scenario tree reduction algorithm, our variants can be eight times faster for reducing scenario trees with 8 stages, 78 125 scenarios, and 97 656 nodes.</description>

      <title>Deciding Bank Interest Rates -- A Major-Minor Impulse Control Mean-Field Game Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciding bank interest rates has been a long-standing challenge in finance. It is crucial to ensure that the selected rates balance market share and profitability. However, traditional approaches typically focus on the interest rate changes of individual banks, often neglecting the interactions with other banks in the market. This work proposes a novel framework that models the interest rate problem as a major-minor mean field game within the context of an interbank game. To incorporate the complex interactions between banks, we utilize mean-field theory and employ impulsive control to model the overhead in rate adjustments. Ultimately, we solve this optimal control problem using a new deep Q-network method, which iterates the parameterized action value functions for major and minor players and updates the networks in a Fictitious Play way. Our proposed algorithm converges, offering a solution that enables the analysis of strategies for major and minor players in the market under the Nash Equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The connected Grundy coloring problem: Formulations and a local-search enhanced biased random-key genetic algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph G=(V,E), a connected Grundy coloring is a proper vertex coloring that can be obtained by a first-fit heuristic on a connected vertex sequence. A first-fit coloring heuristic is one that attributes to each vertex in a sequence the lowest-index color not used for its preceding neighbors. A connected vertex sequence is one in which each element, except for the first one, is connected to at least one element preceding it. The connected Grundy coloring problem consists of obtaining a connected Grundy coloring maximizing the number of colors. In this paper, we propose two integer programming (IP) formulations and a local-search enhanced biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) for the connected Grundy coloring problem. The first formulation follows the standard way of partitioning the vertices into color classes while the second one relies on the idea of representatives in an attempt to break symmetries. The BRKGA encompasses a local search procedure using a newly proposed neighborhood. A theoretical neighborhood analysis is also presented. Extensive computational experiments indicate that the problem is computationally demanding for the proposed IP formulations. Nonetheless, the formulation by representatives outperforms the standard one for the considered benchmark instances. Additionally, our BRKGA can find high-quality solutions in low computational times for considerably large instances, showing improved performance when enhanced with local search and a reset mechanism. Moreover we show that our BRKGA can be easily extended to successfully tackle the Grundy coloring problem, i.e., the one without the connectivity requirements.</description>

      <title>On Linear Convergence in Smooth Convex-Concave Bilinearly-Coupled Saddle-Point Optimization: Lower Bounds and Optimal Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the smooth convex-concave bilinearly-coupled saddle-point problem of the form $\min_x\max_y f(x) + \langle y,\mathbf{B} x\rangle - g(y)$. In the highly specific case where each of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(y)$ is either affine or strongly convex, there exist lower bounds on the number of gradient evaluations and matrix-vector multiplications required to solve the problem, as well as matching optimal algorithms. A notable aspect of these algorithms is that they are able to attain linear convergence, i.e., the number of iterations required to solve the problem is proportional to $\log(1/\epsilon)$. However, the class of bilinearly-coupled saddle-point problems for which linear convergence is possible is much wider and can involve smooth non-strongly convex functions $f(x)$ and $g(y)$. Therefore, we develop the first lower complexity bounds and matching optimal linearly converging algorithms for this problem class. Our lower complexity bounds are much more general, but they cover and unify the existing results in the literature. On the other hand, our algorithm implements the separation of complexities, which, for the first time, enables the simultaneous achievement of both optimal gradient evaluation and matrix-vector multiplication complexities, resulting in the best theoretical performance to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order dynamical system with a smoothing effect for solving paramonotone variational inequalities. Under standard assumptions, we prove that the trajectories of this dynamical system converges to a solution of the variational inequality problem. A time discretization of this dynamical system provides an iterative inertial projection-type method. Our result generalizes and improves the existing results. Some numerical examples are given to confirm the theoretical results and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Digitalizing Railway Operations: An Optimization-Based Train Rescheduling Model for Urban and Interurban Disrupted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel methodology for managing train network disruptions across the entire rail network, leveraging digital tools and methodologies. The approach involves two stages, taking into account possible and practical features such as allowing trains to occupy opposite tracks and considering infrastructure capacity for train stops. In the first stage, important nodes within the train network are identified, considering both a topological feature and passenger demand. Subsequently, the network is aggregated based on these important nodes, employing a digital approach to reduce problem complexity. In the second stage, we develop an Integer Programming model for train rescheduling. We then solve this model using the CPLEX solver to evaluate its efficiency. The first case study applies this methodology to the Iranian railway, which is known as a sparse rail network. The results show minimal deviation from the initial train timetable due to the low frequency of trips in each block. Although the approach successfully addresses the train rescheduling problem for various disruption scenarios on the Iranian railway, the excessive computational time required by the optimization model prompts us to make adjustments. Finally, the second case study demonstrates the implementation of the adjusted model in a busy test network. This adaptation significantly reduces computational time by up to 88%. It can be effectively utilized for disruption management in busy networks, where trains need to receive a secondary timetable promptly when facing disruptions.</description>

      <title>Continuous and discrete-time accelerated methods for an inequality constrained convex optimization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of acceleration methods for an inequality constrained convex optimization problem by using Lyapunov functions. We first approximate such a problem as an unconstrained optimization problem by employing the logarithmic barrier function. Using the Hamiltonian principle, we propose a continuous-time dynamical system associated with a Bregman Lagrangian for solving the unconstrained optimization problem. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that this continuous-time dynamical system exponentially converges to the optimal solution of the inequality constrained convex optimization problem. Moreover, we derive several discrete-time algorithms from this continuous-time framework and obtain their optimal convergence rates. Finally, we present numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Uncertain standard quadratic optimization under distributional assumptions: a chance-constrained epigraphic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard quadratic optimization problem (StQP) consists of minimizing a quadratic form over the standard simplex. Without convexity or concavity of the quadratic form, the StQP is NP-hard. This problem has many relevant real-life applications ranging portfolio optimization to pairwise clustering and replicator dynamics. Sometimes, the data matrix is uncertain. We investigate models where the distribution of the data matrix is known but where both the StQP after realization of the data matrix and the here-and-now problem are indefinite. We test the performance of a chance-constrained epigraphic StQP to the uncertain StQP.</description>

      <title>Linear convergence of proximal descent schemes on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate proximal descent methods, inspired by the minimizing movement scheme introduced by Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto, for optimizing entropy-regularized functionals on the Wasserstein space. We establish linear convergence under flat convexity assumptions, thereby relaxing the common reliance on geodesic convexity. Our analysis circumvents the need for discrete-time adaptations of the Evolution Variational Inequality (EVI). Instead, we leverage a uniform logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and the entropy "sandwich" lemma, extending the analysis from arXiv:2201.10469 and arXiv:2202.01009. The major challenge in the proof via LSI is to show that the relative Fisher information $I(\cdot|\pi)$ is well-defined at every step of the scheme. Since the relative entropy is not Wasserstein differentiable, we prove that along the scheme the iterates belong to a certain class of Sobolev regularity, and hence the relative entropy $\operatorname{KL}(\cdot|\pi)$ has a unique Wasserstein sub-gradient, and that the relative Fisher information is indeed finite.</description>

      <title>Approximating the Gomory Mixed-Integer Cut Closure Using Historical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many operations related optimization problems involve repeatedly solving similar mixed integer linear programming (MILP) instances with the same constraint matrix but differing objective coefficients and right-hand-side values. The goal of this paper is to generate good cutting-planes for such instances using historical data. Gomory mixed integer cuts (GMIC) for a general MILP can be parameterized by a vector of weights to aggregate the constraints into a single equality constraint, where each such equality constraint in turn yields a unique GMIC. In this paper, we prove that for a family of MILP instances, where the right-hand-side of the instances belongs to a lattice, the GMIC closure for every instance in this infinite family can be obtained using the same finite list of aggregation weights. This result motivates us to build a simple heuristic to efficiently select aggregations for generating GMICs from historical data of similar instances with varying right-hand-sides and objective function coefficients. For testing our method, we generated families of instances by perturbing the right-hand-side and objective functions of MIPLIB 2017 instances. The proposed heuristic can significantly accelerate the performance of Gurobi for many benchmark instances, even when taking into account the time required to predict aggregation multipliers and compute the cut coefficients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature of data-driven cutting plane generation that is able to significantly accelerate the performance of a commercial state-of-the-art MILP solver, using default solver settings, on large-scale benchmark instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a Mean Field Games (MFG) system in a real, separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space. The system consists of a second order parabolic type equation, called Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the paper, coupled with a nonlinear Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. Both equations contain a Kolmogorov operator. Solutions to the HJB equation are interpreted in the mild solution sense and solutions to the FP equation are interpreted in an appropriate weak sense. We prove well-posedness of the considered MFG system under certain conditions. The existence of a solution to the MFG system is proved using Tikhonov's fixed point theorem in a proper space. Uniqueness of solutions is obtained under typical separability and Lasry-Lions type monotonicity conditions.</description>

      <title>Reinterpreting PID Controller From the Perspective of State Feedback and Lumped Disturbance Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the motion of solutions to non-homogeneous linear differential equations. It further clarifies that a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller essentially comprises two parts: a homogeneous controller and a disturbance observer, which are responsible for stabilizing the homogeneous system and compensating for the lumped disturbances (non-homogeneous components) of the system respectively. Based on this framework, the impact of measurement noise on control performance is examined, and a parameter tuning scheme for the traditional PID controller is provided. Finally, as examples, controllers are designed for two representative control problems: a trajectory tracking controller for an underactuated vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft in the time domain, and a lateral controller for a vehicle in the distance domain.</description>

      <title>Reactive Robot Navigation Using Quasi-conformal Mappings and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robot control algorithm suitable for safe reactive navigation tasks in cluttered environments. The proposed approach consists of transforming the robot workspace into the \emph{ball world}, an artificial representation where all obstacle regions are closed balls. Starting from a polyhedral representation of obstacles in the environment, obtained using exteroceptive sensor readings, a computationally efficient mapping to ball-shaped obstacles is constructed using quasi-conformal mappings and M\"obius transformations. The geometry of the ball world is amenable to provably safe navigation tasks achieved via control barrier functions employed to ensure collision-free robot motions with guarantees both on safety and on the absence of deadlocks. The performance of the proposed navigation algorithm is showcased and analyzed via extensive simulations and experiments performed using different types of robotic systems, including manipulators and mobile robots.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Speedup of Personalized Federated Reinforcement Learning with Shared Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) enables multiple agents to collaboratively learn a policy without sharing their local trajectories collected during agent-environment interactions. However, in practice, the environments faced by different agents are often heterogeneous, leading to poor performance by the single policy learned by existing FedRL algorithms on individual agents. In this paper, we take a further step and introduce a \emph{personalized} FedRL framework (PFedRL) by taking advantage of possibly shared common structure among agents in heterogeneous environments. Specifically, we develop a class of PFedRL algorithms named PFedRL-Rep that learns (1) a shared feature representation collaboratively among all agents, and (2) an agent-specific weight vector personalized to its local environment. We analyze the convergence of PFedTD-Rep, a particular instance of the framework with temporal difference (TD) learning and linear representations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove a linear convergence speedup with respect to the number of agents in the PFedRL setting. To achieve this, we show that PFedTD-Rep is an example of the federated two-timescale stochastic approximation with Markovian noise. Experimental results demonstrate that PFedTD-Rep, along with an extension to the control setting based on deep Q-networks (DQN), not only improve learning in heterogeneous settings, but also provide better generalization to new environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations describing compressible fluids are prone to the formation of shock singularities, arising from faster upstream fluid particles catching up to slower, downstream ones. In geometric terms, this causes the deformation map to leave the manifold of diffeomorphisms. Information geometric regularization addresses this issue by changing the manifold geometry to make it geodesically complete. Empirical evidence suggests that this results in smooth solutions without adding artificial viscosity. This work makes a first step towards understanding this phenomenon rigorously, in the setting of the unidimensional pressureless Euler equations. It shows that their information geometric regularization has smooth global solutions. By establishing $\Gamma$-convergence of its variational description, it proves convergence of these solutions to entropy solutions of the nominal problem, in the limit of vanishing regularization parameter. A consequence of these results is that manifolds of unidimensional diffeomorphisms with information geometric regularization are geodesically complete.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Vehicle Platooning on Tree Networks: Efficient Time Discretization and Strengthened Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the coordinated vehicle platooning problem on a tree network with time constraints while the routes of vehicles are given. The problem is to coordinate the departure time of each vehicle to enable platoon formation hence maximizing the total fuel saving. For this problem setting, relative time windows can be defined for all vehicles to which an efficient time discretization can be applied. This property leads to a tight mixed-integer linear program reformulation as compared to the continuous-time formulation involving big-M coefficients proposed in our previous work. It is demonstrated by systematic numerical experiments that the reformulation outperforms the continuous-time formulation for this family of problem instances.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Self Selection of Service Type in a Queueing System where Long Service Postpones the Need for the Next Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a closed queueing system that offers two types of service. After obtaining service the customer is active for a period of time whose random duration depends on the service type: the longer service type enables longer activity time. Users can choose a service type every time they are in service, and we are interested in the system efficiency which is the average number of active users. Applications include but are not limited to inventory control, electrical vehicle charging, mobile robotics charging, and machine maintenance. We prove that choosing the more efficient service is not always optimal. We demonstrate that if we constrain the strategy to be a threshold strategy depending on the number of inactive users, then the resulting maximal efficiency is not significantly lower than the maximal efficiency. We also study individuals' optimal selection of the service type, and observe that individuals and the manager have opposite incentives: when the queue is long, individuals choose the long service, while the manager prefers the short service in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control problem of a class of systems governed by the first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with final state constraints. The main contribution is to present the solvability condition and the corresponding explicit optimal controller by using the Lagrange multiplier method and the technique of solving forward and backward partial differential equations (FBPDEs). In particular, the result is reduced to the case with zero-valued final state constraints. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of the designed optimal controller.</description>

      <title>Extended mean-field games with multi-dimensional singular controls and non-linear jump impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a probabilistic framework for analysing extended mean-field games with multi-dimensional singular controls and state-dependent jump dynamics and costs. Two key challenges arise when analysing such games: the state dynamics may not depend continuously on the control and the reward function may not be u.s.c.~Both problems can be overcome by restricting the set of admissible singular controls to controls that can be approximated by continuous ones. We prove that the corresponding set of admissible weak controls is given by the weak solutions to a Marcus-type SDE and provide an explicit characterisation of the reward function. The reward function will in general only be u.s.c.~To address the lack of continuity we introduce a novel class of MFGs with a broader set of admissible controls, called MFGs of parametrisations. Parametrisations are laws of state/control processes that continuously interpolate jumps. We prove that the reward functional is continuous on the set of parametrisations, establish the existence of equilibria in MFGs of parametrisations, and show that the set of Nash equilibria in MFGs of parametrisations and in the underlying MFG with singular controls coincide. This shows that MFGs of parametrisations provide a canonical framework for analysing MFGs with singular controls and non-linear jump impact.</description>

Abstract: The SCIP Optimization Suite provides a collection of software packages for mathematical optimization, centered around the constraint integer programming (CIP) framework SCIP. This report discusses the enhancements and extensions included in the SCIP Optimization Suite 9.0. The updates in SCIP 9.0 include improved symmetry handling, additions and improvements of nonlinear handlers and primal heuristics, a new cut generator and two new cut selection schemes, a new branching rule, a new LP interface, and several bug fixes. The SCIP Optimization Suite 9.0 also features new Rust and C++ interfaces for SCIP, new Python interface for SoPlex, along with enhancements to existing interfaces. The SCIP Optimization Suite 9.0 also includes new and improved features in the LP solver SoPlex, the presolving library PaPILO, the parallel framework UG, the decomposition framework GCG, and the SCIP extension SCIP-SDP. These additions and enhancements have resulted in an overall performance improvement of SCIP in terms of solving time, number of nodes in the branch-and-bound tree, as well as the reliability of the solver.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study in a Hilbertian setting, first and second-order monotone inclusions related to stochastic optimization problems with decision dependent distributions. The studied dynamics are formulated as monotone inclusions governed by Lipschitz perturbations of maximally monotone operators where the concept of equilibrium plays a central role. We discuss the relationship between the $\mathbb{W}_1$-Wasserstein Lipschitz behavior of the distribution and the so-called coarse Ricci curvature. As an application, we consider the monotone inclusions associated with stochastic optimisation problems involving the sum of a smooth function with Lipschitz gradient, a proximable function and a composite term.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Bandit: A Medium Access Control for the IIoT Alarm Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient Random Access (RA) is critical for enabling reliable communication in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. Herein, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based distributed RA scheme, entitled Neural Network-Based Bandit (NNBB), for the IIoT alarm scenario. In such a scenario, the devices may detect a common critical event, and the goal is to ensure the alarm information is delivered successfully from at least one device. The proposed NNBB scheme is implemented at each device, where it trains itself online and establishes implicit inter-device coordination to achieve the common goal. Devices can transmit simultaneously on multiple orthogonal channels and each possible transmission pattern constitutes a possible action for the NNBB, which uses a deep neural network to determine the action. Our simulation results show that as the number of devices in the network increases, so does the performance gain of the NNBB compared to the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) RA benchmark. For instance, NNBB experiences a 7% success rate drop when there are four channels and the number of devices increases from 10 to 60, while MAB faces a 25% drop.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is steered by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is called chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, it is inferred by experimental data. We deploy a PDE-constrained optimization framework to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>First-order optimality conditions for non-commutative optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18707v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the state average of a polynomial of non-commuting variables, over all states and operators satisfying a number of polynomial constraints, and over all Hilbert spaces where such states and operators are defined. Such non-commutative polynomial optimization (NPO) problems are routinely solved through hierarchies of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. By formulating the general NPO problem in Lagrangian terms, we heuristically derive first-order optimality conditions via small variations in the problem variables. Although the derivation is not rigorous, it gives rise to two types of optimality conditions - state and operator - which are rigorously analyzed in the paper. Both types of conditions can be enforced through additional positive semidefinite constraints in the SDP hierarchies. State optimality conditions are shown to be satisfied by all NPO problems. For NPO problems with optimal solutions (such as, e.g., Archimedean ones) they allow enforcing a new type of constraints: namely, restricting the optimization over states to the set of common ground states of an arbitrary number of operators. Operator optimality conditions are the non-commutative analogs of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which are known to hold in many classical optimization problems. In this regard, we prove that a weak form of operator optimality holds for all NPO problems; stronger versions require the problem constraints to satisfy some qualification criterion, just like in the classical case (e.g. Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification). We test the power of the new optimality conditions by computing local properties of ground states of many-body spin systems and the maximum quantum violation of Bell inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For algorithms based on interacting particle systems that admit a mean-field description, convergence analysis is often more accessible at the mean-field level. In order to transfer convergence results obtained at the mean-field level to the finite ensemble size setting, it is desirable to show that the particle dynamics converge in an appropriate sense to the corresponding mean-field dynamics. In this paper, we prove quantitative mean-field limit results for two related interacting particle systems: Consensus-Based Optimization and Consensus-Based Sampling. Our approach requires a generalization of Sznitman's classical argument: in order to circumvent issues related to the lack of global Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients, we discard an event of small probability, the contribution of which is controlled using moment estimates for the particle systems. In addition, we present new results on the well-posedness of the particle systems and their mean-field limit, and provide novel stability estimates for the weighted mean and the weighted covariance.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the problem of controlling linear time-invariant systems subject to time-varying and a priori unknown cost functions, state and input constraints, and exogenous disturbances. We combine the online convex optimization framework with tools from robust model predictive control to propose an algorithm that is able to guarantee robust constraint satisfaction. The performance of the closed loop emerging from application of our framework is studied in terms of its dynamic regret, which is proven to be bounded linearly by the variation of the cost functions and the magnitude of the disturbances. We corroborate our theoretical findings and illustrate implementational aspects of the proposed algorithm by a numerical case study on a tracking control problem of an autonomous vehicle.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Safety Alignment for Large Language Models via Optimal Dualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing safety concerns surrounding large language models raise an urgent need to align them with diverse human preferences to simultaneously enhance their helpfulness and safety. A promising approach is to enforce safety constraints through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For such constrained RLHF, typical Lagrangian-based primal-dual policy optimization methods are computationally expensive and often unstable. This paper presents a perspective of dualization that reduces constrained alignment to an equivalent unconstrained alignment problem. We do so by pre-optimizing a smooth and convex dual function that has a closed form. This shortcut eliminates the need for cumbersome primal-dual policy iterations, greatly reducing the computational burden and improving training stability. Our strategy leads to two practical algorithms in model-based and preference-based settings (MoCAN and PeCAN, respectively). A broad range of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have attained prominence for their ability to synthesize a probability distribution for a given dataset via a diffusion process, enabling the generation of new data points with high fidelity. However, diffusion processes are prone to generating samples that reflect biases in a training dataset. To address this issue, we develop constrained diffusion models by imposing diffusion constraints based on desired distributions that are informed by requirements. Specifically, we cast the training of diffusion models under requirements as a constrained distribution optimization problem that aims to reduce the distribution difference between original and generated data while obeying constraints on the distribution of generated data. We show that our constrained diffusion models generate new data from a mixture data distribution that achieves the optimal trade-off among objective and constraints. To train constrained diffusion models, we develop a dual training algorithm and characterize the optimality of the trained constrained diffusion model. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our constrained models in two constrained generation tasks: (i) we consider a dataset with one or more underrepresented classes where we train the model with constraints to ensure fairly sampling from all classes during inference; (ii) we fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model to sample from a new dataset while avoiding overfitting.</description>

      <title>Sketched Equivariant Imaging Regularization and Deep Internal Learning for Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We then extend our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework -- Sketched Equivariant Deep Image Prior (Sk-EI-DIP), which can be efficiently applied for single-image and task-adapted reconstruction. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach for accelerating both EI-DIP and Sk-EI-DIP via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve order-of-magnitude computational acceleration over standard EI-based counterpart in single-input setting, and network adaptation at test time.</description>
