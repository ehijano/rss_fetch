      <title>Foundation and challenges in modelling Dilute Active Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active suspensions, which consist of suspended self-propelling particles such as swimming microorganisms, often exhibit non-trivial transport properties. Continuum models are frequently employed to elucidate phenomena in active suspensions, such as shear trapping of bacteria, bacterial turbulence, and bioconvection patterns in suspensions of algae. Yet, these models are often empirically derived and may not always agree with the individual-based description of active particles. Here we establish a more rigorous foundation to fully develop a continuum model based on the respective microscopic dynamics through coarse-graining. All the assumptions needed to reach popular continuum models from a multi-particle Fokker-Planck equation, which governs the probability of the full configuration space, are explicitly presented. In the dilute limit, this approach leads to the mean-field model (a.k.a. Doi-Saintillan-Shelley model), which can be further reduced to a continuum equation for particle density. Moreover, we review the limitations and highlight the challenges related to continuum descriptions, including significant issues in implementing physical boundary conditions and the possible emergence of singular solutions.</description>

      <title>Granular segregation across flow geometries: a closure model for the particle segregation velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting particle segregation has remained challenging due to the lack of a general model for the segregation velocity that is applicable across a range of granular flow geometries. Here, a segregation velocity model for dense granular flows is developed by exploiting momentum balance and recent advances in particle-scale modelling of the segregation driving and drag forces over a wide range of particle concentrations, size and density ratios, and flow conditions. This model is shown to correctly predict particle segregation velocity in a diverse set of idealized and natural granular flow geometries simulated using the discrete element method. When incorporated in the well-established advection-diffusion-segregation formulation, the model has the potential to accurately capture segregation phenomena in many relevant industrial application and geophysical settings.</description>

      <title>DiffGLE: Differentiable Coarse-Grained Dynamics using Generalized Langevin Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing the correct dynamics at the Coarse-Grained (CG) scale remains a central challenge in the advancement of systematic CG models for soft matter simulations. The Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE), rooted in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, provides a robust framework for incorporating friction and stochastic forces into CG models, that are lost due to the reduction in degrees of freedom. Leveraging recent advancements in Automatic Differentiation (AD) and reformulating the non-Markovian GLE using a colored noise ansatz, we present a top-down approach for accurately parameterizing the non-Markovian GLE for different coarse-grained fluids that accurately reproduces the velocity-autocorrelation function of the original All-Atom (AA) model. We demonstrate our approach on two different fluids namely, SPC/E water and carbon dioxide which have distinct structure and dynamical characteristics. Importantly, by being end-to-end differentiable, this approach offers a simplified and efficient solution to achieving accurate CG dynamics, effectively bypassing the complexities inherent in most bottom-up methods.</description>

      <title>Aging of the Linear Viscoelasticity of Glass- and Gel-forming Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel approach based on the non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation (NESCGLE) theory that allows for the first principles prediction of the zero-shear viscosity in glass- and- gel-forming materials. This new modulus of the NESCGLE theory facilitates the theoretical description and interpretation of experimental data concerning out-of-equilibrium rheological properties of viscous liquids during their amorphous solidification. The predictive capability of our approach is illustrated here by means of a quantitative comparison between theoretical and experimental results for the zero shear viscosity in suspensions of oligomer-tethered nanoparticles in a polymeric host, finding an almost perfect correspondence between experiments and theory. This comparison also highlights the crucial relevance of including a kinetic perspective, such as that provided by the NESCGLE theory, in the description of dynamic and viscoelastic properties of amorphous states of matter.</description>

      <title>Snap and Jump: How Elastic Shells Pop Out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grip, walk, crawl, and jump. Soft robots are integrated functional structures composed of compliant mechanisms, whose activity spans various industrial applications such as surgery, healthcare, surveillance, and even planetary exploration. One of their promising mobility mechanism is snap-buckling; the instability mode of flexible structures passing from one equilibrium state to another can instantaneously generate large power for its motion. Predicting their performance with even simple geometry requires disentangling material, geometric nonlinearity, and contact, thereby still being a challenging problem to date. Here, we study the jumping dynamics of hemispherical elastic shells driven by snap-buckling, as a model system of soft jumping mechanisms, combining experiments, simulations, and analytical theory. We find that the contact transition dynamics trigger the jumping phenomenon upon snap-buckling by constructing the analytical predictions with shell elasticity in excellent agreement with both experiments and simulations. Despite the simple geometry of the shell, its dynamical performance primarily relies on a complex interplay between elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. By elucidating the dynamics of the building blocks of soft robots that undergo large deformations, we can build their predictive experimental and numerical framework. Our research paves the way for designing soft robots suitable for the required loading conditions or structural requirements without empirical methods.</description>

      <title>Chiral, Topological, and Knotted Colloids in Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric shape, symmetry, and topology of colloidal particles often allow for controlling colloidal phase behavior and physical properties of these soft matter systems. In liquid crystalline dispersions, colloidal particles with low symmetry and nontrivial topology of surface confine-ment are of particular interest, including surfaces shaped as handlebodies, spirals, knots, mul-ti-component links, and so on. These types of colloidal surfaces induce topologically nontrivial three-dimensional director field configurations and topological defects. Director switching by electric fields, laser tweezing of defects, and local photo-thermal melting of the liquid crystal host medium promote transformations among many stable and metastable particle-induced director configurations that can be revealed by means of direct label-free three-dimensional nonlinear op-tical imaging. The interplay between topologies of colloidal surfaces, director fields, and defects is found to show a number of unexpected features, such as knotting and linking of line defects, often uniquely arising from the nonpolar nature of the nematic director field. This review article high-lights fascinating examples of new physical behavior arising from the interplay of nematic mo-lecular order and both chiral symmetry and topology of colloidal inclusions within the nematic host. Furthermore, the article concludes with a brief discussion of how these findings may lay the groundwork for new types of topology-dictated self-assembly in soft condensed matter leading to novel mesostructured composite materials, as well as for experimental insights into the pure-math aspects of low-dimensional topology.</description>

      <title>The role of surface material properties on the behavior of ionic liquids in nanoconfinement: A critical review and perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room temperature ionic liquids show great promise as electrolytes in various technological applications, such as energy storage or electrotunable lubrication. These applications are particularly intriguing due to the specific behavior of ionic liquids in nanoconfinement. While previous research has been focused on optimizing the required characteristics through the selection of electrolyte properties, the contribution of confining material properties in these systems has been largely overlooked. In this Review, we provide constructive analysis of recent developments related to the description of surface material properties impact on the ionic liquid behavior in the confinement and propose potential ways for further investigations in this direction. Although the presented advances reveal the importance of surface material properties in the application processes with confined ionic liquids, there are still a lot of issues that should be thoroughly investigated in future. We believe that this review will significantly contribute to the development of new approaches with material properties consideration for confined ionic liquid research.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic interactions between a sedimenting squirmer and a planar wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions between a sedimenting microswimmer and a solid wall have ubiquitous biological and technological applications. A plethora of gravity-induced swimming dynamics near a planar no-slip wall provides a platform for designing artificial microswimmers that can generate directed propulsion through their translation-rotation coupling near a wall. In this work we provide exact solutions for a squirmer (a model swimmer of spherical shape with a prescribed slip velocity) facing either towards or away from a planar wall perpendicular to gravity. These exact solutions are used to validate a numerical code based on the boundary integral method with an adaptive mesh for distances from the wall down to 0.1% of the squirmer radius. This boundary integral code is then used to investigate the rich gravity-induced dynamics near a wall, mapping out the detailed bifurcation structures of the swimming dynamics in terms of orientation and distance to the wall. Simulation results show that a squirmer may transverse along the wall, move to a fixed point at a given height with a fixed orientation in a monotonic way or in an oscillatory fashion, or oscillate in a limit cycle in the presence of wall repulsion.</description>

      <title>A convolutional neural network technique for online tracking of the radius evolution of levitating evaporating microdroplets of pure liquids, liquid mixtures and suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used convolutional neural network in a classification task to track the radius evolution of levitating evaporating microdroplets of pure diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol water polystyrene microparticles suspension, dipropylene glycol water mixture and dipropylene glycol water silica nanoparticles suspension. We discretized a wider radii range into short radii segments, labeled them with class numbers and generated theoretically light scattering patterns from Mie theory. Then the network was trained on the theoretical images and used to classify unlabeled experimentally recorded Mie scattering patterns from the evaporating microdroplets. A plot of the class average radii versus the camera s time step revealed the profile of the entire droplet radius evolution. We were able to work with approximately 1500 classes and showed that the technique has the potential to distinguish droplet size difference of 5 nm. We expect it to be applicable for online or real time tracking of droplet evaporation.</description>

      <title>Coherent X-rays reveal anomalous molecular diffusion and cage effects in crowded protein solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding protein motion within the cell is crucial for predicting reaction rates and macromolecular transport in the cytoplasm. A key question is how crowded environments affect protein dynamics through hydrodynamic and direct interactions at molecular length scales. Using megahertz X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (EuXFEL), we investigate ferritin diffusion at microsecond time scales. Our results reveal anomalous diffusion, indicated by the non-exponential decay of the intensity autocorrelation function $g_2(q,t)$ at high concentrations. This behavior is consistent with the presence of cage-trapping in between the short- and long-time protein diffusion regimes. Modeling with the $\delta\gamma$-theory of hydrodynamically interacting colloidal spheres successfully reproduces the experimental data by including a scaling factor linked to the protein direct interactions. These findings offer new insights into the complex molecular motion in crowded protein solutions, with potential applications for optimizing ferritin-based drug delivery, where protein diffusion is the rate-limiting step.</description>

      <title>Supercritical density fluctuations and structural heterogeneity in supercooled water-glycerol microdroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments and theoretical studies strongly indicate that water exhibits a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) in the supercooled domain. An open question is how the LLPT of water can affect the properties of aqueous solutions. Here, we study the structural and thermodynamic properties of supercooled glycerol-water microdroplets at dilute conditions ($\chi_g=3.2~\%$ glycerol mole fraction). The combination of rapid evaporative cooling with ultrafast X-ray scattering allows us to outrun crystallization and gain access to the deeply supercooled regime down to $T=229.3$ K. We find that the density fluctuations of the glycerol-water solution or, equivalently, its isothermal compressibility, $\kappa_T$, increases upon cooling. This is confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that the presence of glycerol shifts the temperature of maximum $\kappa_T$ from $T=230$ K in pure water down to $T=223$ K in the solution. Our findings elucidate the interplay between the complex behavior of water, including its LLPT, and the properties of aqueous solutions at low temperatures, which can have practical consequences in cryogenic biological applications and cryopreservation techniques.</description>

      <title>The most severe imperfection governs the buckling strength of pressurized multi-defect hemispherical shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a probabilistic investigation on the effect of systematically removing imperfections on the buckling behavior of pressurized thin, elastic, hemispherical shells containing a distribution of defects. We employ finite element simulations, which were previously validated against experiments, to assess the maximum buckling pressure, as measured by the knockdown factor, of these multi-defect shells. Specifically, we remove fractions of either the least or the most severe imperfections to quantify their influence on the buckling onset. We consider shells with a random distribution of defects whose mean amplitude and standard deviation are systematically explored while, for simplicity, fixing the width of the defect to a characteristic value. Our primary finding is that the most severe imperfection of a multi-defect shell dictates its buckling onset. Notably, shells containing a single imperfection corresponding to the maximum amplitude (the most severe) defect of shells with a distribution of imperfections exhibit an identical knockdown factor to the latter case. Our results suggest a simplified approach to studying the buckling of more realistic multi-defect shells, once their most severe defect has been identified, using a well-characterized single-defect description, akin to the weakest-link setting in extreme-value probabilistic problems.</description>

      <title>Macrotransport of active particles in periodic channels and fields: rectification and dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport and dispersion of active particles in structured environments such as corrugated channels and porous media are important for the understanding of both natural and engineered active systems. Owing to their continuous self-propulsion, active particles exhibit rectified transport under spatially asymmetric confinement. While progress has been made in experiments and particle-based simulations, a theoretical understanding of the effective long-time transport dynamics in spatially periodic geometries remains less developed. In this paper, we apply generalized Taylor dispersion theory (GTDT) to analyze the long-time effective transport dynamics of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in periodic channels and fields. We show that the long-time transport behavior is governed by an effective advection-diffusion equation. The derived macrotransport equations allow us to characterize the average drift and effective dispersion coefficient. For the case of ABPs subject to a no-flux boundary condition at the channel wall, we show that regardless of activity, the average drift is given by the net diffusive flux along the channel. For ABPs, their activity is the driving mechanism that sustains a density gradient, which ultimately leads to rectified motion along the channel. Our continuum theory is validated against direct Brownian dynamics simulations of the Langevin equations governing the motion of each ABP.</description>

      <title>Steady Motions of Single Spherical Microswimmers in Non-Newtonian Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In biological systems, microswimmers often propel themselves through complex media. However, many aspects of swimming mechanisms in non-Newtonian fluids remain unclear. This study considers the propulsion of two types of single spherical microswimmers (squirmers) in shear-thickening and shear-thinning fluids. The slip-driven squirmer propels faster/slower in shear-thickening/thinning fluids than in Newtonian fluids [C. Datt et al., ''Squirming through shear-thinning fluids,'' J. Fluid Mech. 784, R1 (2015)]. In contrast, we discovered that a traction-driven squirmer exhibits the opposite trend, moving slower/faster in shear-thickening/thinning fluids than in Newtonian fluids. In addition, we have shown theoretically that Purcell's scallop theorem does not hold in non-Newtonian fluids when a squirmer with reciprocal surface motions is used. The present findings open up possibilities for the design of new types of microswimmers that can achieve translational motion from a single reciprocal motion in non-Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. We show that they are distinct from quasicrystals, which we argue are akin to Fourier ''duals'' of gyromorphs. Using a coupled dipole approximation, we show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. Finally, we introduce ''polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

      <title>Spool-nematic ordering of dsDNA and dsRNA under confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of double-stranded DNA or RNA to locally melt and form kinks leads to strong non-linear elasticity effects that qualitatively affect their packing in confined spaces. Using analytical theory and numerical simulation we show that kink formation entails a mixed spool-nematic ordering of double-stranded DNA or RNA in spherical capsids, consisting of an outer spool domain and an inner, twisted nematic domain. These findings explain the experimentally observed nematic domains in viral capsids and imply that non-linear elasticity must be considered to predict the configurations and dynamics of double-stranded genomes in viruses, bacterial nucleoids or gene-delivery vehicles. The non-linear elastic theory suggests that spool-nematic ordering is a general feature of strongly confined kinkable polymers.</description>

      <title>The Cellular Potts Model on Disordered Lattices</title>

Abstract: The Cellular Potts model, also known as the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg model, is a lattice-based approach by which biological tissues at the level of individual cells can be numerically studied. Traditionally, a square or hexagonal underlying lattice structure is assumed for two-dimensional systems, and this is known to introduce artifacts in the structure and dynamics of the model tissues. That is, on regular lattices, cells can assume shapes that are dictated by the symmetries of the underlying lattice. Here, we developed a variant of this method that can be applied to a broad class of (ir)regular lattices. We show that on an irregular lattice deriving from a fluid-like configuration, two types of artifacts can be removed. We further report on the transition between a fluid-like disordered and a solid-like hexagonally ordered phase present for monodisperse confluent cells as a function of their surface tension. This transition shows the hallmarks of a first-order phase transition and is different from the glass/jamming transitions commonly reported for the vertex and active Voronoi models. We emphasize this by analyzing the distribution of shape parameters found in our state space. Our analysis provides a useful reference for the future study of epithelia using the (ir)regular Cellular Potts model.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and stochastic simulations of chemically active droplets</title>

Abstract: Biomolecular condensates play a central role in the spatial organization of living matter. Their formation is now well understood as a form of liquid-liquid phase separation that occurs very far from equilibrium. For instance, they can be modeled as active droplets, where the combination of molecular interactions and chemical reactions result in microphase separation. However, so far, models of chemically active droplets are spatially continuous and deterministic. Therefore, the relationship between the microscopic parameters of the models and some crucial properties of active droplets (such as their polydispersity, their shape anisotropy, or their typical lifetime) is yet to be established. In this work, we address this question computationally, using Brownian dynamics simulations of chemically active droplets: the building blocks are represented explicitly as particles that interact with attractive or repulsive interactions, depending on whether they are in a droplet-forming state or not. Thanks to this microscopic and stochastic view of the problem, we reveal how driving the system away from equilibrium in a controlled way determines the fluctuations and dynamics of active emulsions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Face-Dependent Ice Growth Kinetics: Insights from Molecular Dynamics on the Basal and Prism Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07050</link>

Abstract: Ice nucleation and growth are critical in many fields, including atmospheric science, cryobiology, and aviation. However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of ice crystal growth remains challenging. In this work, crystallization at the ice/quasi-liquid layer (QLL) interface of the basal and primary prism (prism1) surfaces of hexagonal ice (Ih) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations across a wide range of temperatures for the TIP4P/Ice model, with comparisons to the mW coarse-grained model. Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with a crossover in QLL thickness and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapour pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.</description>
