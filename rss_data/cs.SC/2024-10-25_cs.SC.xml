      <title>Hypergeometric Solutions of Linear Difference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Petkov\v{s}ek's algorithm for computing hypergeometric solutions of scalar difference equations to the case of difference systems $\tau(Y) = M Y$, with $M \in {\rm GL}_n(C(x))$, where $\tau$ is the shift operator. Hypergeometric solutions are solutions of the form $\gamma P$ where $P \in C(x)^n$ and $\gamma$ is a hypergeometric term over $C(x)$, i.e. ${\tau(\gamma)}/{\gamma} \in C(x)$. Our contributions concern efficient computation of a set of candidates for ${\tau(\gamma)}/{\gamma}$ which we write as $\lambda = c\frac{A}{B}$ with monic $A, B \in C[x]$, $c \in C^*$. Factors of the denominators of $M^{-1}$ and $M$ give candidates for $A$ and $B$, while another algorithm is needed for $c$. We use the super-reduction algorithm to compute candidates for $c$, as well as other ingredients to reduce the list of candidates for $A/B$. To further reduce the number of candidates $A/B$, we bound the so-called type of $A/B$ by bounding local types. Our algorithm has been implemented in Maple and experiments show that our implementation can handle systems of high dimension, which is useful for factoring operators.</description>

      <title>Neural Concept Binder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge in object-based visual reasoning lies in generating concept representations that are both descriptive and distinct. Achieving this in an unsupervised manner requires human users to understand the model's learned concepts and, if necessary, revise incorrect ones. To address this challenge, we introduce the Neural Concept Binder (NCB), a novel framework for deriving both discrete and continuous concept representations, which we refer to as "concept-slot encodings". NCB employs two types of binding: "soft binding", which leverages the recent SysBinder mechanism to obtain object-factor encodings, and subsequent "hard binding", achieved through hierarchical clustering and retrieval-based inference. This enables obtaining expressive, discrete representations from unlabeled images. Moreover, the structured nature of NCB's concept representations allows for intuitive inspection and the straightforward integration of external knowledge, such as human input or insights from other AI models like GPT-4. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the hard binding mechanism preserves model performance while enabling seamless integration into both neural and symbolic modules for complex reasoning tasks. We validate the effectiveness of NCB through evaluations on our newly introduced CLEVR-Sudoku dataset.</description>
