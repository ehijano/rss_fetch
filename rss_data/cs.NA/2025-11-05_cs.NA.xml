      <title>Explicit invariant-preserving integration of differential equations using homogeneous projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for numerically solving differential equations while preserving invariants. As in standard projection methods, we project an arbitrary base integrator onto an invariant-preserving manifold, however, our method exploits homogeneous symmetries to evaluate the projection exactly and in closed form. This yields explicit invariant-preserving integrators for a broad class of nonlinear systems, as well as pseudo-invariant-preserving schemes capable of preserving multiple invariants to arbitrarily high precision. The resulting methods are high-order and introduce negligible computational overhead relative to the base solver. When incorporated into adaptive solvers such as Dormand-Prince 8(5,3), they provide error-controlled, invariant-preserving, high-order time-stepping schemes. Numerical experiments on double-pendulum and Kepler ODEs as well as semidiscretised KdV and Camassa-Holm PDEs demonstrate substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency over standard approaches.</description>

      <title>A Joint Variational Framework for Multimodal X-ray Ptychography and Fluorescence Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering high-resolution structural and compositional information from coherent X-ray measurements involves solving coupled, nonlinear, and ill-posed inverse problems. Ptychography reconstructs a complex transmission function from overlapping diffraction patterns, while X-ray fluorescence provides quantitative, element-specific contrast at lower spatial resolution. We formulate a joint variational framework that integrates these two modalities into a single nonlinear least-squares problem with shared spatial variables. This formulation enforces cross-modal consistency between structural and compositional estimates, improving conditioning and promoting stable convergence. The resulting optimization couples complementary contrast mechanisms (i.e., phase and absorption from ptychography, elemental composition from fluorescence) within a unified inverse model. Numerical experiments on simulated data demonstrate that the joint reconstruction achieves faster convergence, sharper and more quantitative reconstructions, and lower relative error compared with separate inversions. The proposed approach illustrates how multimodal variational formulations can enhance stability, resolution, and interpretability in computational X-ray imaging.</description>

      <title>On Eigenvector Computation and Eigenvalue Reordering for the Non-Hermitian Quaternion Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present several additions to the quaternion QR algorithm, including algorithms for eigenvector computation and eigenvalue reordering. A key outcome of the eigenvalue reordering algorithm is that the aggressive early deflation (AED) technique, which significantly enhances the convergence of the QR algorithm, is successfully applied to the quaternion eigenvalue problem. We conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of positivity-preserving finite difference scheme for the Flory-Huggins-Cahn-Hilliard equation with dynamical boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard equation has a wide range of applications in many areas of physics and chemistry. To describe the short-range interaction between the solution and the boundary, scientists have constructed dynamical boundary conditions by introducing boundary energy. In this work, the dynamical boundary condition is located on two opposite edges of a square domain and is connected with bulk by a normal derivative. A convex-splitting numerical approach is proposed to enforce the positivity-preservation and energy dissipation, combined with the finite difference spatial approximation. The $\ell^\infty(0,T;H_h^{-1}) \cap \ell^2(0,T;H_h^1)$ convergence analysis and error estimate is theoretically established, with the first order accuracy in time and second order accuracy in space. The bulk and surface discrete mass conservation of the exact solution is required to reach the mean-zero property of the error function, so that the associated discrete $H_h^{-1}$ norm is well-defined. The mass conservation on the physical boundary is maintained by the classic Fourier projection. In terms of the mass conservation in bulk, we introduce a trigonometric auxiliary function based on the truncation error expansion, so that the bulk mass conservation is achieved, and it has no effect on the boundary. The smoothness of trigonometric function makes the Taylor expansion valid and maintains the convergence order of truncation error as well. As a result, the convergence analysis could be derived with a careful nonlinear error estimate.</description>

      <title>About subspaces the most deviating from the coordinate ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking the largest principal angle as the distance function between same dimensional nontrivial linear subspaces in $\mathds{R}^n$, we describe the class of subspaces deviating from all the coordinate ones by at least $\arccos(1 / \sqrt{n})$. This study compliments and is motivated by the long-standing hypothesis put forward in \cite{GTZ1997} and essentially stating that so-defined distance to the closest coordinate subspace cannot exceed $\arccos(1 / \sqrt{n})$. In this context, the subspaces presented here claim to be the extremal ones.
  Realized as the star spaces of all nontrivial 2-connected series-parallel graphs with certain edge weights and arbitrary edge directions, the given subspaces may be of interest beyond numerical linear algebra within which the original problem was formulated.</description>

      <title>Sparse Source Identification in Transient Advection-Diffusion Problems with a Primal-Dual-Active-Point Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a mathematical model to enable rapid prediction of airborne contaminant transport based on scarce sensor measurements. The method is designed for applications in critical infrastructure protection (CIP), such as evacuation planning following contaminant release. In such scenarios, timely and reliable decision-making is essential, despite limited observation data. To identify contaminant sources, we formulate an inverse problem governed by an advection-diffusion equation. Given the problem's underdetermined nature, we further employ a variational regularization ansatz and model the unknown contaminant sources as distribution over the spatial domain. To efficiently solve the arising inverse problem, we employ a problem-specific variant of the Primal-Dual-Active-Point (PDAP) algorithm which efficiently approximates sparse minimizers of the inverse problem by alternating between greedy location updates and source intensity optimization. The approach is demonstrated on two- and three-dimensional test cases involving both instantaneous and continuous contaminant sources and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with $L^2$-regularization. Its effectiveness is further illustrated in complex domains with real-world building geometries imported from OpenStreetMap.</description>

      <title>A Block-Shifted Cyclic Reduction Algorithm for Solving a Class of Quadratic Matrix Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cyclic reduction (CR) algorithm is an efficient method for solving quadratic matrix equations that arise in quasi-birth-death (QBD) stochastic processes. However, its convergence is not guaranteed when the associated matrix polynomial has more than one eigenvalue on the unit circle. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel iteration method, referred to as the Block-Shifted CR algorithm, that improves the CR algorithm by utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD) and block shift-and-deflate techniques. This new approach extends the applicability of existing solvers to a broader class of quadratic matrix equations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The stability of shallow neural networks on spheres: A sharp spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an estimation of the condition numbers of the \emph{mass} and \emph{stiffness} matrices arising from shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks defined on the unit sphere~$\mathbb{S}^d$. In particular, when $\{\theta_j^*\}_{j=1}^n \subset \mathbb{S}^d$ is \emph{antipodally quasi-uniform}, the condition number is sharp. Indeed, in this case, we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for the full spectrum of eigenvalues and characterize the structure of the corresponding eigenspaces, showing that the smallest eigenvalues are associated with an eigenbasis of low-degree polynomials while the largest eigenvalues are linked to high-degree polynomials. This spectral analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the approximation power of the network and its numerical stability.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates of Generic Discretisation of Reaction-Diffusion System with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a parabolic reaction diffusion system with constraints that model biofilm growth. Within a unified framework encompassing multiple numerical schemes, we derive the first general convergence rates for approximating this model using both conforming and non conforming discretisation methods. Under standard assumptions on the time discretisation, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution. Numerical experiments are conducted using a mixed finite volume scheme that fits within the proposed unified framework. A test case with an analytical solution is designed to confirm our theoretical convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Joint transfer pricing decision on tangible and intangible assets for multinational firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While conventional multinational firms (MNFs) often avoid taxes by transferring their profits to low-tax regions through markup on tangible asset costs, high-tech MNFs may avoid taxes by transferring royalty fees to intangible assets (i.e., royalty-based transfer prices). This study investigates the effects of tax differences, markups, and royalties on decision-making. We also compare the different effects of markups and royalties on the improvement of MNFs' after-tax profit under two main business structures: the commissionaire operational structure (C) with complete information, and the limited-risk operational structure (R) in the principal-agent setting. We find that the tax difference always improves MNFs' profits under the C structure, whereas non-monotonic behavior exists under the R structure. More interestingly, when the order quantity is relatively small, the markup improves MNFs' profits faster than the royalty; conversely, the royalty improves MNFs' profits faster than the markup.</description>

      <title>Discretization and convergence of the ballistic Benamou-Brenier formulation of the porous medium and Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02662v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discretization, convergence, and numerical implementation of recent reformulations of the quadratic porous medium equation (multidimensional and anisotropic) and Burgers' equation (one-dimensional, with optional viscosity), as forward in time variants of the Benamou-Brenier formulation of optimal transport. This approach turns those evolution problems into global optimization problems in time and space, of which we introduce a discretization, one of whose originalities lies in the harmonic interpolation of the densities involved. We prove that the resulting schemes are unconditionally stable w.r.t. the space and time steps, and we establish a quadratic convergence rate for the dual PDE solution, under suitable assumptions. We also show that the schemes can be efficiently solved numerically using a proximal splitting method and a global space-time fast Fourier transform, and we illustrate our results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Numerical valuation of European options under two-asset infinite-activity exponential L\'evy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method for the valuation of European-style options under two-asset infinite-activity exponential L\'evy models. Our method extends the effective approach developed by Wang, Wan &amp; Forsyth (2007) for the 1-dimensional case to the 2-dimensional setting and is applicable for general L\'evy measures under mild assumptions. A tailored discretization of the non-local integral term is developed, which can be efficiently evaluated by means of the fast Fourier transform. For the temporal discretization, the semi-Lagrangian theta-method is employed in a convenient splitting fashion, where the diffusion term is treated implicitly and the integral term is handled explicitly by a fixed-point iteration. Numerical experiments for put-on-the-average options under Normal Tempered Stable dynamics reveal favourable second-order convergence of our method whenever the exponential L\'evy process has finite-variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variety of criteria for selecting k representative columns from a real matrix A with rank(A)&gt;=k. The criteria include the following optimization problems: absolute volume and S-optimality maximization; norm and condition minimization in the two-norm, Frobenius norm and Schatten p-norms for p&gt;2; stable rank maximization; and the new criterion of relative volume maximization. We show that these criteria are NP hard and do not admit polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS). To formulate the optimization problems as decision problems, we derive optimal values for the subset selection criteria, as well as expressions for partitioned pseudo-inverses.</description>

      <title>Approximation by Certain Complex Nevai Operators : Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximation of complex-valued functions is of fundamental importance as it generalizes classical approximation theory to the complex domain, providing a rigorous framework for amplitude and phase-dependent phenomena. In this paper, we study the Nevai operator, a concept formulated by the distinguished mathematician Paul G. Nevai. We propose a family of complex Nevai interpolation operators to approximate analytic as well as non-analytic complex-valued functions along with real-life application in image processing. In this direction, the first operator is constructed using Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, namely complex generalized Nevai operators for approximating complex-valued continuous functions. We establish the approximation results for the proposed operators utilizing the notion of a modulus of continuity. To approximate not necessary continuous but integrable function, we define complex Kantorovich type Nevai operators and establish their boundedness and convergence. Furthermore, in order to approximate functions preserving higher derivatives, we introduce complex Hermite type Nevai operators and study their approximation capabilities using higher order of modulus of continuity. To validate the theoretical results, we provide numerical illustrations of approximation abilities of proposed family of complex Nevai operators.</description>

      <title>Finite element analysis for a Herrmann pressure formulation of the elastoacoustic problem with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two and three dimensions, this study is focused on the numerical analysis of an eigenproblem associated with a fluid-structure model for sloshing and elasto-acoustic vibration. We use a displacement-Herrmann pressure formulation for the solid, while for the fluid, a pure displacement formulation is considered. Under this approach we propose a non conforming locking-free method based on classic finite elements to approximate the natural frequencies (of the eigenmodes) of the coupled system. Employing the theory for non-compact operators we prove convergence and error estimates. Also we propose an a posteriori error estimator for this coupled problem which is shown to be efficient and reliable. All the presented theory is contrasted with a set of numerical tests in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>A computationally efficient fractional predictor corrector approach involving the Mittag Leffler kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, based on Newton interpolation we have proposed a numerical scheme of predictor-corrector type in order to solve fractional differential equations with the fractional derivative involving the Mittag-Leffler function. We have added an auxiliary midpoint in each sub-interval, this allows us to use a piecewise quadratic Newton interpolation to derive the corrector scheme. The derivation of the schemes for the midpoint and the predictor is done by means of a piecewise linear Newton interpolation. We present some illustrative examples for initial value problems that involve fractional derivatives in the sense of Atangana-Baleanu. The results of numerical experiments show that the proposed scheme is a powerful technique to handle fractional differential equations with nonlinear terms that involve operators of Atangana-Baleanu type. Moreover, the proposed method significantly improves the numerical accuracy in comparison with other methods.</description>

      <title>Variational Geometry-aware Neural Network based Method for Solving High-dimensional Diffeomorphic Mapping Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for high-dimensional diffeomorphic mapping often struggle with the curse of dimensionality. We propose a mesh-free learning framework designed for $n$-dimensional mapping problems, seamlessly combining variational principles with quasi-conformal theory. Our approach ensures accurate, bijective mappings by regulating conformality distortion and volume distortion, enabling robust control over deformation quality. The framework is inherently compatible with gradient-based optimization and neural network architectures, making it highly flexible and scalable to higher-dimensional settings. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical image data validate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed method in complex registration scenarios.</description>

      <title>DeepContour: A Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Accelerating Generalized Eigenvalue Problem Solving via Efficient Contour Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets, achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue involving matrices of high dimension.</description>

      <title>Locally-Supervised Global Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements, encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework. Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data, while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast, we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches. We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring substantially less ground truth data.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Learning of Interaction Laws in Multispecies Particle Systems with Gaussian Processes: Convergence Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Gaussian process framework for learning interaction kernels in multi-species interacting particle systems from trajectory data. Such systems provide a canonical setting for multiscale modeling, where simple microscopic interaction rules generate complex macroscopic behaviors. While our earlier work established a Gaussian process approach and convergence theory for single-species systems, and later extended to second-order models with alignment and energy-type interactions, the multi-species setting introduces new challenges: heterogeneous populations interact both within and across species, the number of unknown kernels grows, and asymmetric interactions such as predator-prey dynamics must be accommodated. We formulate the learning problem in a nonparametric Bayesian setting and establish rigorous statistical guarantees. Our analysis shows recoverability of the interaction kernels, provides quantitative error bounds, and proves statistical optimality of posterior estimators, thereby unifying and generalizing previous single-species theory. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its advantages over existing kernel-based methods. This work contributes a complete statistical framework for data-driven inference of interaction laws in multi-species systems, advancing the broader multiscale modeling program of connecting microscopic particle dynamics with emergent macroscopic behavior.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Discrete and Continuous Action Spaces in Reservoir Management and Inventory Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of discrete and continuous action spaces within the contexts of reservoir management and inventory control problems. We explore the computational trade-offs between discrete action discretizations and continuous action settings, focusing on their effects on time complexity and space requirements across different horizons. Our analysis includes a detailed evaluation of discretization levels in reservoir management, highlighting that finer discretizations approach the performance of continuous actions but at increased computational costs. For inventory control, we investigate deterministic and stochastic demand scenarios, demonstrating the exponential growth in time and space with increasing discrete actions and inventory items. We also introduce a novel symbolic approach for solving continuous problems in hybrid MDPs (H-MDPs), utilizing a new XADD data structure to manage piecewise symbolic value functions. Our results underscore the challenges of scaling solutions and provide insights into efficient handling of discrete and continuous action spaces in complex decision problems. Future research directions include exploring heuristic search methods and improved approximations for enhancing the practicality of exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Data Valuation via Leverage Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data, making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a Non-Newtonian drop impact on a rigid surface: A mess-free approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study explores the impact of a non-Newtonian fluid drop on a rigid surface using a mesh-free approach, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynam-ics. The complex interaction between viscous and elastic forces during drop impact may be reproduced by integrating the Oldroyd-B model, which de-scribes viscoelastic fluids, into the developed computational framework. A suit-able boundary condition is assumed for interaction between fluid and solid sur-faces. The ongoing study examines how a droplet deforms, spreads, and recoils after an impact due to its viscoelasticity. The developed computational frame-work is validated by comparing results from existing literature, providing an understanding of how viscoelasticity influences drop-impact behaviour and opening up new avenues for subsequent research in fluid dynamic problems.</description>

      <title>Cycle-Sync: Robust Global Camera Pose Estimation through Enhanced Cycle-Consistent Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone -- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery, and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion pipelines with bundle adjustment.</description>

      <title>In Situ Training of Implicit Neural Compressors for Scientific Simulations via Sketch-Based Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02659v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result. While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning, we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons, and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel discrepancies are a powerful tool for analyzing worst-case errors in quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Building on recent advances in optimizing such discrepancy measures, we extend the subset selection problem to the setting of kernel discrepancies, selecting an m-element subset from a large population of size $n \gg m$. We introduce a novel subset selection algorithm applicable to general kernel discrepancies to efficiently generate low-discrepancy samples from both the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube, the traditional setting of classical QMC, and from more general distributions $F$ with known density functions by employing the kernel Stein discrepancy. We also explore the relationship between the classical $L_2$ star discrepancy and its $L_\infty$ counterpart.</description>

      <title>An accelerated primal-dual flow for linearly constrained multiobjective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02751v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a continuous-time primal-dual approach for linearly constrained multiobjective optimization problems. A novel dynamical model, called accelerated multiobjective primal-dual flow, is presented with a second-order equation for the primal variable and a first-order equation for the dual variable. It can be viewed as an extension of the accelerated primal-dual flow by Luo [arXiv:2109.12604, 2021] for the single objective case. To facilitate the convergence rate analysis, we introduce a new merit function, which motivates the use of the feasibility violation and the objective gap to measure the weakly Pareto optimality. By using a proper Lyapunov function, we establish the exponential decay rate in the continuous level. After that, we consider an implicit-explicit scheme, which yields an accelerated multiobjective primal-dual method with a quadratic subproblem, and prove the sublinear rates of the feasibility violation and the objective gap, under the convex case and the strongly convex case, respectively. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Inexact Solves in Model Reduction of Non-parametric Second-order Dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.09283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we focus on Model Order Reduction (MOR) of non-parametric second-order dynamical systems. In these MOR algorithms, sequences of large and sparse linear systems arise during the model reduction process. Solving such linear systems is the main computational bottleneck in efficient scaling of these MOR algorithms for reducing extremely large dynamical systems. Preconditioned iterative methods are often used for solving such linear systems.
  These iterative methods introduce errors because they solve the linear systems up to a certain tolerance. Hence, our focus is to analyze the stability of these MOR algorithms when using inexact linear solves. Adaptive Iterative Rational Global Arnoldi (AIRGA) is a popular MOR algorithm belonging to this category. We prove that, under four mild conditions, the AIRGA algorithm is backward stable with respect to the errors introduced by these inexact linear solves. Our results easily extend to other MOR algorithms belonging to this category.
  Our first condition enforces the use of a Ritz-Galerkin based linear solver, where the residual of a linear system is made orthogonal to the corresponding Krylov subspace. Our second condition requires satisfying few extra orthogonalities. We show how to modify the underlying linear solver to achieve these extra orthogonalities. We further demonstrate that using a recycling variant of the underlying linear solver helps us achieve these orthogonalities cheaply and with no code changes.
  Our third condition involves existence and invertibility of a matrix mostly dependent upon the input dynamical system, with the norm of this matrix bounded by one. Our fourth and final condition involves being able to compute a perturbation from the derived expression and bounding its norm by one as well. The last two conditions are easily satisfied by all our models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a supervised learning scheme for the first order Hamilton--Jacobi PDEs in high dimensions. The scheme is designed by using the geometric structure of Wasserstein Hamiltonian flows via a density coupling strategy. It is equivalently posed as a regression problem using the Bregman divergence, which provides the loss function in learning while the data is generated through the particle formulation of Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow. We prove a posterior estimate on $L^1$ residual of the proposed scheme based on the coupling density. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can be used to describe the behaviors of Hamilton--Jacobi PDEs beyond the singularity formations on the support of coupling density. Several numerical examples with different Hamiltonians are provided to support our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iterative deblurring, notably the Richardson-Lucy algorithm with and without regularization, is analyzed in the context of nuclear and high-energy physics applications. In these applications, probability distributions may be discretized into a few bins, measurement statistics can be high, and instrument performance can be well understood. In such circumstances, it is essential to understand the deblurring first without any explicit noise considerations. We employ singular value decomposition for the blurring matrix in a low-count pixel system. A strong blurring may yield a null space for the blurring matrix. Yet, a nonnegativity constraint for images built into the deblurring may help restore null-space content in a high-contrast image with zero or low intensity for a sufficient number of pixels. For low-contrast images, control over null-space content can be achieved through regularization. When regularization is applied, the blurred image is, in practice, restored to one that is still blurred but less than the starting image.</description>

      <title>Robust feedback control of collisional plasma dynamics in presence of uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fusion aims to confine high-temperature plasma within a device, enabling the fusion of deuterium and tritium nuclei to release energy. Due to the very large temperatures involved, it is essential to isolate the plasma from the device walls to prevent structural damage and the external magnetic fields play a fundamental role in achieving this confinement. In realistic settings, the physical mechanisms governing plasma behavior are highly complex, involving numerous uncertain parameters and intricate particle interactions, such as collisions, that significantly affect both confinement efficiency and overall stability. In this work, we address particularly these challenges by proposing a robust feedback control strategy designed to steer the plasma towards a desired spatial region, despite the presence of uncertainties. From a modeling perspective, we consider a collisional plasma described by a Vlasov-Poisson-BGK system, which accounts for a self-consistent electric field and a strong external magnetic field, while incorporating uncertainty in the model. A key feature of the proposed control strategy is its independence from the random parameter, making it particularly suitable for practical applications. A series of numerical simulations confirms the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrates the ability of external magnetic fields to successfully confine plasma away from the device boundaries, even in the presence of uncertain conditions.</description>

      <title>High-order Gauss-Legendre methods admit a composition representation and a conjugate-symplectic counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most classical pairs of symplectic and conjugate-symplectic schemes is given by the Midpoint method (the Gauss-Runge-Kutta method of order 2) and the Trapezoidal rule. These can be interpreted as compositions of the Implicit and Explicit Euler methods, taken in direct and reverse order, respectively. This naturally raises the question of whether a similar composition structure exists for higher-order Gauss-Legendre methods. In this paper, we provide a positive answer by first examining the fourth-order case and then outlining a generalization to higher orders.</description>

      <title>Generalized singular value decompositions of dual quaternion matrices and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-dimensional data processing and data analysis related to dual quaternion statistics, generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of a dual quaternion matrix pair is an essential numerical linear algebra tool for an elegant problem formulation and numerical implementation. In this paper, building upon the existing singular value decomposition (SVD) of a dual quaternion matrix, we put forward several types of GSVD of dual quaternion data matrices in accordance with their dimensions. Explicitly, for a given dual quaternion matrix pair $\{{\boldsymbol A}, {\boldsymbol B}\}$, if ${\boldsymbol A}$ and ${\boldsymbol B}$ have the same number of columns, we investigate two forms of their quotient-type SVD (DQGSVD) through different strategies, which can be selected to use in different scenarios. Three artificial examples are presented to illustrate the principle of the DQGSVD.
  Alternatively, if ${\boldsymbol A}$ and ${\boldsymbol B}$ have the same number of rows, we consider their canonical correlation decomposition (DQCCD). If ${\boldsymbol A}$ and ${\boldsymbol B}$ are consistent for dual quaternion matrix multiplication, we present their product-type SVD (DQPSVD). As a preparation, we also study the QR decomposition of a dual quaternion matrix based on the dual quaternion Householder transformation, and introduce the CS decomposition of an 2-by-2 blocked unitary dual quaternion matrix. Due to the peculiarity of containing dual part for dual quaternion matrices, the obtained series of GSVD of dual quaternion matrices dramatically distinguish from those in the real number field, the complex number field, and even the quaternion ring, but can be treated as an extension of them to some extent.</description>

      <title>SCOUT: Semi-Lagrangian COnservative and Unconditionally sTable schemes for nonlinear advection-diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new semi-Lagrangian (SL) finite difference scheme for nonlinear advection-diffusion problems. To ensure conservation, which is fundamental for achieving physically consistent solutions, the governing equations are integrated over a space-time control volume constructed along the characteristic curves originating from each computational point. By applying Gauss theorem, all space-time surface integrals can be evaluated. For nonlinear problems, a nonlinear equation must be solved to find the foot of the characteristic, while this is not needed in linear cases. This formulation yields SL schemes that are fully conservative and unconditionally stable, as verified by numerical experiments with CFL numbers up to 100. Moreover, the diffusion terms are, for the first time, directly incorporated within a conservative semi-Lagrangian framework, leading to the development of a novel characteristic-based Crank-Nicolson discretization in which the diffusion contribution is implicitly evaluated at the foot of the characteristic. A broad set of benchmark tests demonstrates the accuracy, robustness, and strict conservation property of the proposed method, as well as its unconditional stability.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for solving Black-Scholes PDEs for high-dimensional option pricing in finance and its complexity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>

      <title>Consistent and convergent discretizations of Helfrich-type energies on general meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that integral curvature energies on surfaces of the type $E_0(M) := \int_M f(x,n_M(x),D n_M(x))\,d\mathcal{H}^2(x)$ have discrete versions for triangular complexes, where the shape operator $D n_M$ is replaced by the piecewise gradient of a piecewise affine edge director field. We combine an ansatz-free asymptotic lower bound for any uniform approximation of a surface with triangular complexes and a recovery sequence consisting of any regular triangulation of the limit sequence and an almost optimal choice of edge director.</description>

      <title>Inducing Riesz and orthonormal bases in $L^2$ via composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $C_h$ be a composition operator mapping $L^2(\Omega_1)$ into $L^2(\Omega_2)$ for some open sets $\Omega_1, \Omega_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. We characterize the mappings $h$ that transform Riesz bases of $L^2(\Omega_1)$ into Riesz bases of $L^2(\Omega_2)$. Restricting our analysis to differentiable mappings, we demonstrate that mappings $h$ that preserve Riesz bases have Jacobian determinants that are bounded away from zero and infinity. We discuss implications of these results for approximation theory, highlighting the potential of using bijective neural networks to construct Riesz bases with favorable approximation properties.</description>

      <title>Near Real-time Adaptive Isotropic and Anisotropic Image-to-mesh Conversion for Numerical Simulations Involving Cerebral Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presented are two techniques that are designed to help streamline the discretization of complex vascular geometries within the numerical modeling process. The first method integrates multiple software tools into a single pipeline which can generate adaptive anisotropic meshes from segmented medical images. The pipeline is shown to satisfy quality, fidelity, smoothness, and robustness requirements while providing near real-time performance for medical image-to-mesh conversion. The second method approximates a user-defined sizing function to generate adaptive isotropic meshes of good quality and fidelity in real-time. Tested with two brain aneurysm cases and utilizing up to 96 CPU cores within a single, multicore node on Purdue University's Anvil supercomputer, the parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing method utilizes a hierarchical load balancing model (designed for large, cc-NUMA shared memory architectures) and contains an optimized local reconnection operation that performs three times faster than its original implementation from previous studies. The adaptive isotropic method is shown to generate a mesh of up to approximately 50 million elements in less than a minute while the adaptive anisotropic method is shown to generate approximately the same number of elements in about 5 minutes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Slip Boundary Condition: Surface Roughness as a Hidden Tuning Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of boundary surface roughness on numerical simulations of incompressible fluid flow past a cylinder in two and three spatial dimensions furnished with slip boundary conditions. The governing equations are approximated using a continuous finite element method, stabilized with a Galerkin least-squares approach.
  Through a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that: $(i)$ the introduction of surface roughness through numerical discretization error, or mesh distortion, makes the potential flow solution unstable; $(ii)$ when numerical surface roughness and mesh distortion are minimized by using high-order isoparametric geometry mappings, a stable potential flow is obtained in both two and three dimensions; $(iii)$ numerical surface roughness, mesh distortion and refinement level can be used as control parameters to manipulate drag and lift forces resulting in numerical values spanning more than an order of magnitude.
  Our results cast some doubt on the predictive capability of the slip boundary condition for wall modeling in turbulent simulations of incompressible flow.</description>

      <title>Shifted Composition IV: Toward Ballistic Acceleration for Log-Concave Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acceleration is a celebrated cornerstone of convex optimization, enabling gradient-based algorithms to converge sublinearly in the condition number. A major open question is whether an analogous acceleration phenomenon is possible for log-concave sampling. Underdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD) has long been conjectured to be the natural candidate for acceleration, but a central challenge is that its degeneracy necessitates the development of new analysis approaches, e.g., the theory of hypocoercivity. Although recent breakthroughs established ballistic acceleration for the (continuous-time) ULD diffusion via space-time Poincare inequalities, (discrete-time) algorithmic results remain entirely open: the discretization error of existing analysis techniques dominates any continuous-time acceleration.
  In this paper, we give a new coupling-based local error framework for analyzing ULD and its numerical discretizations in KL divergence. This extends the framework in Shifted Composition III from uniformly elliptic diffusions to degenerate diffusions, and shares its virtues: the framework is user-friendly, applies to sophisticated discretization schemes, and does not require contractivity. Applying this framework to the randomized midpoint discretization of ULD establishes the first ballistic acceleration result for log-concave sampling (i.e., sublinear dependence on the condition number). Along the way, we also obtain the first $d^{1/3}$ iteration complexity guarantee for sampling to constant total variation error in dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>Linearization-Based Feedback Stabilization of McKean-Vlasov PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a feedback control framework for stabilizing the McKean-Vlasov PDE on the torus. Our goal is to steer the dynamics toward a prescribed stationary distribution or accelerate convergence to it using a time-dependent control potential. We reformulate the controlled PDE in a weighted, zero-mean space and apply the ground-state transform to obtain a Schrodinger-type operator. The resulting operator framework enables spectral analysis, verification of the infinite-dimensional Hautus test, and construction of a Riccati-based feedback law derived from the linearized dynamics, yielding local exponential stabilization with a chosen convergence rate. We rigorously prove local exponential stabilization via maximal regularity arguments and nonlinear estimates. Numerical experiments on well-studied models in one and two dimensions (the noisy Kuramoto model for synchronization, the O(2) spin model in a magnetic field, and the von Mises attractive interaction potential) showcase the effectiveness of our control strategy, demonstrating convergence acceleration and stabilization of unstable equilibria.</description>

      <title>Learning Low Rank Neural Representations of Hyperbolic Wave Dynamics from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.</description>
