      <title>A systematic framework to construct unconventional superconducting pairing scar states using multi-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to construct model Hamiltonians that have unconventional superconducting pairing states as exact energy eigenstates, by incorporating multi-body interactions (i.e., interactions among more than two particles). The multi-body interactions are introduced in a form of the local density-density coupling in such a way that any pair configuration in real space has the same interaction energy by cancelling the two-body and multi-body interactions. Our approach is applicable to both spinless and spinful models in any spatial dimensions and on any bipartite lattices, facilitating an exhaustive extension of Yang's $s$-wave $\eta$-pairing state to various other unconventional pairing symmetries ($p$-wave, $d$-wave, $f$-wave, etc.). We verify that the two-dimensional spinful Hubbard model on a square lattice with the multi-body interactions has the $d$-wave pairing state as an energy eigenstate, which can be regarded as a quantum many-body scar state as evidenced from the numerical analysis of the pair correlation function, the entanglement entropy, and the level statistics. We also discuss other examples, including $f$-wave pairing states on a honeycomb lattice, $s$-wave pairing states in a nearest-neighbor interacting system, and spinless $p$-wave pairing states in one dimension.</description>

      <title>A review: The Gor'kov-Teitel'baum thermal activation model for cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While closing their famous paper entitled "Pseudogap: friend or foe of high-Tc?" Norman, Pines, and Kallin underlined that before we have a microscopic theory, we must have a consistent phenomenology. This was in 2005. As it turns out in 2006 a phenomenological theory of the pseudogap state was proposed by Gor'kov and Teitel'baum. This originated from their careful analysis of the Hall effect data, and it has been very successful model as numerous investigations over the years has shown. In this mini-review the essence of the idea of Gor'kov and Teitel'baum is presented. The pseudogap obtained by them from the Hall effect data agrees very well with that obtained from the ARPES data. This famous Gor'kov-Teitel'baum Thermal Activation model (in short GTTA model) not only presents a consistent phenomenology of the pseudogap state but also it rationalizes the Hall angle data and it presents a strong case against the famous "two-relaxation times" idea of Anderson and collaborators.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Towards exact solutions for the superconducting $T_c$ induced by electron-phonon interaction"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of recent articles, Liu, Yang, Pan, et al. claim to have determined the exact dressed electron-boson vertex for a number of very general interacting many-body problems by inverting certain Ward-Takahashi identities. Here, we point out that their Ward-Takahashi identities are missing terms which make the inversion of the identities impossible. One therefore cannot formulate exact self-contained integral equations for the dressed electron propagator. In addition, the proposed vertex expressions do not reproduce well-established results for the leading perturbative corrections.</description>

      <title>Probing electron quadrupling order through ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have pointed to the formation of a new state of matter, the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ . The state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two critical points, separating it from the superconducting and normal metal states. The adjacent two critical points make acoustic effects a promising tool to study such states because of their sensitivity to symmetry-breaking transitions. We report a theory of the acoustic effects of systems with an electron quadrupling phase and new ultrasound velocity measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. The presented theory for the electron quadrupling state gives the same type of singularities that are observed in experiment.</description>

      <title>From orbital to paramagnetic pair breaking in layered superconductor 2H-NbS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides 2H-NbSe$_2$ and 2H-NbS$_2$ are intensively studied on account of their unique electronic properties such as Ising superconductivity, found in multi- and monolayers, with upper critical fields beyond the Pauli limit. Even in bulk crystals, there are reports of multiband superconductivity and exotic states, such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase. In this work, we investigate the superconducting properties of 2H-NbS$_2$ through a detailed high-field mapping of the phase diagram by means of magnetotransport and magnetostriction experiments. We compare the phase diagram between bulk crystals and a 6~nm thick flake of 2H-NbS$_2$ and find a drastically enhanced Maki parameter in the flake, signifying a change of the relevant pair breaking mechanism from orbital to paramagnetic pair breaking, which we attribute to an effect of enhanced spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Cooperation between electron-phonon coupling and electronic interaction in bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has garnered significant interests. While researches have predominantly focused on the role of electron-electron interactions in the superconducting mechanism, the impact of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) has remained elusive. In this work, we perform first-principles calculations to study the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling within La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure and explore of the interplay between EPC and electronic interactions on the superconductivity by employing functional renormalization group approach. Our calculations reveal that EPC alone is insufficient to trigger superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. We identify unique out-of-plane and in-plane breathing phonon modes which selectively couple with the Ni $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, showcasing an orbital-selective EPC. Within the bilayer two-orbital model, it is revealed that solely electronic interactions foster $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing characterized by notable frustration in the band space, leading to a low transition temperature. Remarkably, we find that this out-of-plane EPC can act in concert with electronic interactions to promote the onsite and interlayer pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, partially releasing the pairing frustration and thus elevating T$_c$. In contrast, the inclusion of in-plane EPC only marginally affects the superconductivity, distinct from the cuprates. Potential experimental implications in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dephasing in Fluxonium Qubits from Coherent Quantum Phase Slips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase slips occur across all Josephson junctions (JJs) at a rate that increases with the impedance of the junction. In superconducting qubits composed of JJ-array superinductors -- such as fluxonium -- phase slips in the array can lead to decoherence. In particular, phase-slip processes at the individual array junctions can coherently interfere, each with an Aharonov--Casher phase that depends on the offset charges of the array islands. These coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) perturbatively modify the qubit frequency, and therefore charge noise on the array islands will lead to dephasing. By varying the impedance of the array junctions, we design a set of fluxonium qubits in which the expected phase-slip rate within the JJ-array changes by several orders of magnitude. We characterize the coherence times of these qubits and demonstrate that the scaling of CQPS-induced dephasing rates agrees with our theoretical model. Furthermore, we perform noise spectroscopy of two qubits in regimes dominated by either CQPS or flux noise. We find the noise power spectrum associated with CQPS dephasing appears to be featureless at low frequencies and not $1/f$. Numerical simulations indicate this behavior is consistent with charge noise generated by charge-parity fluctuations within the array. Our findings broadly inform JJ-array-design tradeoffs, relevant for the numerous superconducting qubit designs employing JJ-array superinductors.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective Mott phase and spin nematicity in Ni-substituted FeTe$_{0.65}$Se$_{0.35}$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The normal state in iron chalcogenides is metallic but highly unusual, with orbital and spin degrees of freedom partially itinerant or localized depending on temperature, leading to many unusual features. In this work, we report on the observations of two of such features, the orbital selective Mott phase (OSMP) and spin nematicity, evidenced in magnetization and magnetotransport [resistivity, Hall effect, anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)] of Fe$_{1-y}$Ni$_y$Te$_{0.65}$Se$_{0.35}$ single crystals, with $0 &lt; y &lt; 0.21$. Substitution of Ni dopes crystals with electrons, what eliminates some of the hole pockets from Fermi level, leaving only one, originating from $d_{xy}$ orbital. This leads to electron-dominated conduction at low $T$ for $y \gtrsim 0.06$. However, at high temperatures, $T \gtrsim 125 \div 178$ K, the conduction reverses to hole-dominated. Anomalies in magnetization and resistivity are observed at temperatures which approach high-$T$ boundary of the electron-dominated region. Analysis of these effects suggests a link with the appearance of the $d_{z^2}$ hole pockets at X points of the Brillouin zone in the OSMP phase, facilitated by the localization of $d_{xy}$ orbital, as recently reported by angular resolved photoemission experiments ($\textit{J. Huang et al., Commun. Phys. 5, 29 (2022)}$). The low-$T$ AMR shows mixed 4-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry of in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy, with the 4-fold term the largest at small $y$, and suppressed at intermediate $y$. These results are consistent with the mixed stripe/bicollinear magnetic correlations at small $y$, and suppression of stripe correlations at intermediate $y$, indicating development of spin nematicity with increasing Ni doping, which possibly contributes to the suppression of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Theory of tunneling spectroscopy in $p$-wave altermagnet-superconductor hybrid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the tunneling conductance of a junction consisting of a two-dimensional $p$-wave altermagnet (AM) and a superconductor (SC) for various pairing states. The zero bias conductance peaks arising from the dispersionless surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) in $d_{xy}$-wave and $p_{x}$-wave superconductor junctions are robust against varying the altermagnetic spin-splitting strength $\alpha _{y}$. Moreover, for chiral $p$- or chiral $d$-wave SCs, zero bias conductance shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of $\alpha_{y}$ indicating the existence of the dispersive SABSs. Our obtained results of tunneling spectroscopy based on a $p$-wave AM serve as an effective way for the identification of the pairing states of unconventional superconductors. It is noted that our used Hamiltonian of AM is also available for persistent spin helix systems.</description>

      <title>Drastic magnetic-field-induced chiral current order and emergent current-bond-field interplay in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00623v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In kagome metals, the chiral current order $\eta$ with time-reversal-symmetry-breaking is the source of various exotic electronic states, while the method of controlling the current order and its interplay with the star-of-David bond order $\phi$ are still unsolved. Here, we reveal that tiny uniform orbital magnetization $M[\eta,\phi]$ is induced by the chiral current order, and its magnitude is prominently enlarged under the presence of the bond order. Importantly, we derive the magnetic-field ($h$)-induced Ginzburg-Landau free energy expression $\Delta F[h,\eta,\phi]$, which enables us to elucidate the field-induced current-bond phase transitions in kagome metals. The emergent current-bond-$h$ trilinear coupling term in the free energy, $-3m_1 h\eta\phi$, naturally explains the characteristic magnetic field sensitive electronic states in kagome metals, such as the field-induced current order and the strong interplay between the bond and current orders. Furthermore, we present a natural explanation for the drastic strain-induced increment of the current order transition temperature T_{TRSB} reported by a recent experiment.</description>

      <title>Low temperature phase transitions under CDW state in kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A=Cs,Rb,K): Significance of mix-type Fermi surface electron correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18087v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the multistage phase transitions in V-based kagome metals inside the charge-density-wave (CDW) phase, we focus on the impact of the "mix-type" Fermi surface because it is intact in the CDW state on the "pure-type" Fermi surface. On the mixed-type Fermi surface, moderate spin correlations develop, and we reveal that uniform (q=0) bond order is caused by the paramagnon interference mechanism, which is described by the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex correction. A dominant solution is the E2g-symmetry nematic order, in which the director can be rotated arbitrarily. In addition, we obtain the A1g-symmetry non-nematic order, which leads to the change in the lattice constants without symmetry breaking. The predicted E2g and A1g channel fluctuations at q=0 can be observed by the elastoresistance measurements. These results are useful to understand the multistage phase transitions inside the 2 $\times$ 2 CDW phase. The present theory has a general significance because mix-type band structure universally exists in various kagome lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose controlling the hybridization between Majorana zero modes at the ends of magnetic adatom chains on superconductors by an additional magnetic adatom deposited close by. By tuning the additional adatom's magnetization, position, and coupling to the superconductor, we can couple and decouple the Majorana modes as well as control the ground state parity. The scheme is independent of microscopic details in ferromagnetic and helical magnetic chains on superconductors with and without spin-orbit coupling, which we show by studying their full microscopic models and their common low-energy description. Our results show that scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance techniques are promising tools for controlling the Majorana hybridization in magnetic adatoms-superconductor setups, providing a basis for Majorana parity measurements, fusion, and braiding techniques.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the lattice BCS-BEC crossover in strongly correlated superconductors: resilient coherence from multiorbital physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures - a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we report on an enhancement of superconductivity beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover realized in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A$_3$C$_{60}$). We show how strong correlations and multiorbital effects lead into a localized superconducting regime characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. These insights are derived from the development of a theoretical framework to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length ($\xi_0$) and the London penetration depth ($\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$), in microscopic theories and from first principles, even in presence of strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Chiral Surface State in Superconducting NbGe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and superconductivity in quantum materials harbors rich physics ripe for discovery. In this study, we investigate the topological properties and superconductivity of the nonsymmorphic chiral superconductor NbGe$_2$ using high-resolution angle-resolved pho-toemission spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, and ab initio calculations. The ARPES data revealed exotic chiral surface states on the (100) surface originating from the inherent chiral crystal structure. Supporting calculations indicate that NbGe$_2$ likely hosts elusive Weyl fermions in its bulk electronic structure. Furthermore, we uncovered the signatures of van Hove singularities that can enhance many-body interactions. Additionally, transport measurements demonstrated that NbGe$_2$ exhibits superconductivity below 2K. Overall, our comprehensive results provide the first concrete evidence that NbGe$_2$ is a promising platform for investigating the interplay between non-trivial band topology, possible Weyl fermions, van Hove singularities, and superconductivity in chiral quantum materials.</description>
