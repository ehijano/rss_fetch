      <title>Assessing the Information Content of Individual Spikes in Population-Level Models of Neural Spiking Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, there have been major advances in clusterless decoding algorithms for neural data analysis. These algorithms use the theory of marked point processes to describe the joint activity of many neurons simultaneously, without the need for spike sorting. In this study, we examine information-theoretic metrics to analyze the information extracted from each observed spike under such clusterless models. In an analysis of spatial coding in the rat hippocampus, we compared the entropy reduction between spike-sorted and clusterless models for both individual spikes observed in isolation and when the prior information from all previously observed spikes is accounted for. Our analysis demonstrates that low-amplitude spikes, which are difficult to cluster and often left out of spike sorting, provide reduced information compared to sortable, high-amplitude spikes when considered in isolation, but the two provide similar levels of information when considering all the prior information available from past spiking. These findings demonstrate the value of combining information measures with state-space modeling and yield new insights into the underlying mechanisms of neural computation.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Planar Cortical Magnification with Optimal Transport and Topological Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human visual system exhibits non-uniform spatial resolution across the visual field, which is characterized by the cortical magnification factor (CMF) that reflects its anatomical basis. However, current approaches for quantifying CMF using retinotopic maps derived from BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are limited by the inherent low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI data and inaccuracies in the topological relationships of the retinotopic maps. In this study, we introduced a new pipeline to quantify planar CMF from retinotopic maps generated from the population receptive field (pRF) model. The pipeline projected the 3D pRF solutions onto a 2D planar disk, using optimal transport (OT) to preserve local cortical surface areas, and applied topological smoothing to ensure that the resulting retinotopic maps maintain their topology. We then estimated 2D CMF maps from the projected retinotopic maps on the planar disk using the 1-ring patch method. Applying this pipeline to the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7T dataset, we revealed previously unobserved CMF patterns across the visual field and demonstrated individual differences among the 181 subjects. The pipeline was further validated on the New York University (NYU) 3T dataset, showing reliable and repeatable results. Our study provided new analytical methods and offered novel insights into visual processing.</description>

      <title>Visual Function Profiles via Multi-Path Aggregation Reveal Neuron-Level Responses in the Drosophila Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting individual neurons' responses and spatial functional properties in complex visual tasks remains a key challenge in understanding neural computation. Existing whole-brain connectome models of Drosophila often rely on parameter assumptions or deep learning approaches, yet remain limited in their ability to reliably predict dynamic neuronal responses. We introduce a Multi-Path Aggregation (MPA) framework, based on neural network steady-state theory, to build a whole-brain Visual Function Profiles (VFP) of Drosophila neurons and predict their responses under diverse visual tasks. Unlike conventional methods relying on redundant parameters, MPA combines visual input features with the whole-brain connectome topology. It uses adjacency matrix powers and finite-path optimization to efficiently predict neuronal function, including ON/OFF polarity, direction selectivity, and responses to complex visual stimuli. Our model achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.84+/-0.12 for ON/OFF responses, outperforming existing methods (0.33+/-0.59), and accurately captures neuron functional properties, including luminance and direction preferences, while allowing single-neuron or population-level blockade simulations. Replacing CNN modules with VFP-derived Lobula Columnar(LC) population responses in a Drosophila simulation enables successful navigation and obstacle avoidance, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in guiding embodied behavior. This study establishes a "connectome-functional profile-behavior" framework, offering a whole-brain quantitative tool to study Drosophila visual computation and a neuron-level guide for brain-inspired intelligence.</description>

      <title>Memory-Amortized Inference: A Topological Unification of Search, Closure, and Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary ML separates the static structure of parameters from the dynamic flow of inference, yielding systems that lack the sample efficiency and thermodynamic frugality of biological cognition. In this theoretical work, we propose \textbf{Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI)}, a formal framework rooted in algebraic topology that unifies learning and memory as phase transitions of a single geometric substrate. Central to our theory is the \textbf{Homological Parity Principle}, which posits a fundamental dichotomy: even-dimensional homology ($H_{even}$) physically instantiates stable \textbf{Content} (stable scaffolds or ``what''), while odd-dimensional homology ($H_{odd}$) instantiates dynamic \textbf{Context} (dynamic flows or ``where''). We derive the logical flow of MAI as a topological trinity transformation: \textbf{Search $\to$ Closure $\to$ Structure}. Specifically, we demonstrate that cognition operates by converting high-complexity recursive search (modeled by \textit{Savitch's Theorem} in NPSPACE) into low-complexity lookup (modeled by \textit{Dynamic Programming} in P) via the mechanism of \textbf{Topological Cycle Closure}. We further show that this consolidation process is governed by a topological generalization of the Wake-Sleep algorithm, functioning as a coordinate descent that alternates between optimizing the $H_{odd}$ flow (inference/wake) and condensing persistent cycles into the $H_{even}$ scaffold (learning/sleep). This framework offers a rigorous explanation for the emergence of fast-thinking (intuition) from slow-thinking (reasoning) and provides a blueprint for post-Turing architectures that compute via topological resonance.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Koopman Machine for Interpretable Longitudinal Personalized Alzheimer's Disease Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early forecasting of individual cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is central to disease evaluation and management. Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($\alpha$) and biological ($\beta$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression.</description>

      <title>Graceful forgetting: Memory as a process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rational framework is proposed to explain how we accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded memory. Memory is stored as statistics organized into structures that are repeatedly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. Repeated summarization requires an intensive ongoing process guided by heuristics that help optimize the memory for future needs. Sensory input is rapidly encoded as simple statistics that are progressively elaborated into more abstract constructs. This framework differs from previous accounts of memory by reliance on statistics as a representation of memory, the use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics at each summarization step, and the hypothesis of a process that is complex and expensive. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.</description>

      <title>Resting State Functional Connectivity Patterns Associate with Alcohol Use Disorder Characteristics: Insights from the Triple Network Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prolonged alcohol use results in neuroadaptations that mark more severe and treatment-resistant alcohol use. The goal of this study was to identify functional connectivity brain patterns underlying Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)-related characteristics in fifty-five adults (31 female) who endorsed heavy alcohol use. We hypothesized that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the Salience (SN), Frontoparietal (FPN), and Default Mode (DMN) networks would reflect self-reported recent and lifetime alcohol use, laboratory-based alcohol seeking, urgency, and sociodemographic characteristics related to AUD. To test our hypothesis, we combined the triple network model (TNM) of psychopathology with a multivariate data-driven approach, regularized partial least squares (rPLS), to unfold concurrent functional connectivity (FC) patterns and their association with AUD-related characteristics. We observed three concurrent associations of interest: i) drinking and age-related cross communication between the SN and both the FPN and DMN; ii) family history density of AUD and urgency anticorrelations between the SN and FPN; and iii) alcohol seeking and sex-associated SN and DMN interactions. These findings provide an integrative interpretation for many individual findings reported in the literature relating functional connectivity signatures and AUD factors. Moreover, we identified a set of neural mechanisms and brain regions concomitant with AUD-related characteristics that can serve as potential treatment targets across clinical and preclinical models.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Bioplausible Neuron for SNN for Event Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired approach to computer vision that can lead to more efficient processing of visual data with reduced energy consumption. However, maintaining homeostasis within these networks is challenging, as it requires continuous adjustment of neural responses to preserve equilibrium and optimal processing efficiency amidst diverse and often unpredictable input signals. In response to these challenges, we propose the Asynchronous Bioplausible Neuron (ABN), a dynamic spike firing mechanism to auto-adjust the variations in the input signal. Comprehensive evaluation across various datasets demonstrates ABN's enhanced performance in image classification and segmentation, maintenance of neural equilibrium, and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Artificial Human Intelligence: The role of Humans in the Development of Next Generation AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human intelligence, the most evident and accessible form of source of reasoning, hosted by biological hardware, has evolved and been refined over thousands of years, positioning itself today to create new artificial forms and preparing to self--design their evolutionary path forward. Beginning with the advent of foundation models, the rate at which human and artificial intelligence interact with each other has exceeded any anticipated quantitative figures. The close engagement led both bits of intelligence to be impacted in various ways, which naturally resulted in complex confluences that warrant close scrutiny. Recent advances, such as DeepSeek, exemplify this interplay: the novel contributions, we argue, draw indirect inspiration from biological principles like modular neural specialization and sparse episodic encoding, addressing computational bottlenecks while aligning with human-inspired scalability. In the sequel, using a novel taxonomy, we shall explore this interplay between human and machine intelligence, focusing on the crucial role humans play in developing ethical, responsible, and robust intelligent systems. We briefly delve into various aspects of implementation inspired by the mechanisms underlying neuroscience and human cognition. In addition, we propose future perspectives, capitalizing on the advantages of symbiotic designs to suggest a human-centered direction for next-generation developments, focusing on the augmentation role of AI. We finalize this evolving document with some thoughts and open questions yet to be addressed by the broader community.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on energy use in quasi-static Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) has brought increasing attention to their energy use during training and inference. Here, we establish the thermodynamic bounds on energy consumption in quasi-static analog DNNs by mapping modern feedforward architectures onto a physical free-energy functional. This framework provides a direct statistical-mechanical interpretation of quasi-static DNNs. As a result, inference can proceed in a thermodynamically reversible manner, with vanishing minimal energy cost, in contrast to the Landauer limit that constrains digital hardware. Importantly, inference corresponds to relaxation to a unique free-energy minimum with F_{\min}=0, allowing all constraints to be satisfied without residual stress. By comparison, training overconstrains the system: simultaneous clamping of inputs and outputs generates stresses that propagate backward through the architecture, reproducing the rules of backpropagation. Parameter annealing then relaxes these stresses, providing a purely physical route to learning without an explicit loss function. We further derive a universal lower bound on training energy, E&lt; 2NDkT, which scales with both the number of trainable parameters and the dataset size.</description>

      <title>Internal World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational role of imagination remains debated. While classical accounts emphasize reward maximization, emerging evidence suggests imagination serves a broader function: accessing internal world models (IWMs). Here, we employ psychological network analysis to compare IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs) through imagination vividness ratings. Using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2) and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (PSIQ), we construct imagination networks from three human populations (Florida, Poland, London; N=2,743) and six LLM variants in two conversation conditions. Human imagination networks demonstrate robust correlations across centrality measures (expected influence, strength, closeness) and consistent clustering patterns, indicating shared structural organization of IWMs across populations. In contrast, LLM-derived networks show minimal clustering and weak centrality correlations, even when manipulating conversational memory. These systematic differences persist across environmental scenes (VVIQ-2) and sensory modalities (PSIQ), revealing fundamental disparities between human and artificial world models. Our network-based approach provides a quantitative framework for comparing internally-generated representations across cognitive agents, with implications for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence systems.</description>
