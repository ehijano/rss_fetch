      <title>Robust Synchronization of Time-Fractional Memristive Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study robust synchronization of time-fractional Hopfield neural networks with memristive couplings and Hebbian learning rules. This new model of artificial neural networks exhibits strong memory and long-range path-dependence in learning processes. Through scaled group estimates it is proved that under rather general assumptions the solution dynamics is globally dissipative. The main result established a threshold condition for achieving robust synchronization of the neural networks if it is satisfied by the interneuron coupling strength coefficient. The synchronizing threshold is explicitly computable in terms of the original parameters and strictly decreasing for the fractional order $\alpha \in (0, 1)$.</description>

      <title>On the Propulsion of a Rigid Body in a Viscous Liquid by Time-Periodic Force with a Zero Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform analytical and numerical analyses of the propulsion of a rigid body in a viscous fluid subjected to a periodic force with zero average over a period. This general formulation specifically addresses the significant case, where propulsion is generated by the oscillation of a mass located in an internal cavity of the body. We provide a rigorous proof of the necessary and sufficient conditions for propulsion at the second order of magnitude of the force. These conditions are implemented and confirmed by numerical tests for bodies without fore-and-aft symmetry, while they are silent for bodies with such symmetry, like round ellipsoids. Consequently, in this case, propulsion can only occur at an order higher than the second. This problem is investigated by numerically integrating the entire set of equations, and the result shows that, in fact, propulsion does occur, thus opening new avenues for further analytical studies.</description>

      <title>$L_p$-estimates of the conormal derivative problem for parabolic equations with time measurable coefficients and $A_p$-weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates weighted mixed-norm estimates for divergence-type parabolic equations on Reifenberg-flat domains with the conormal derivative boundary condition. The leading coefficients are assumed to be merely measurable in the time variable and to have small mean oscillations in the spatial variables. In deriving the boundary estimates, we overcome a regularity issue by employing half-time derivative estimates.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of curved fronts for spatially periodic combustion reaction-diffusion equations in $\mathbb{R}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with curved fronts of combustion reaction-diffusion equations in spatially periodic media in $\mathbb{R}^N$ $(N\geq2)$. Under the assumption that there are moving pulsating fronts for any given propagation direction $e \in \mathbb{S}^{N-1}$, and by constructing suitable super- and sub-solutions, we prove the existence of a curved front with polytope-like shape in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Then we show that the curved front is unique and asymptotically stable.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric self-similar solutions to the MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the axisymmetric self-similar solutions $(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{B})$ to the stationary MHD equations, where $\mathbf{u}=u^r(r,z)\mathbf{e}_{r}+u^{\theta}(r,z)\mathbf{e}_{\theta}+u^z(r,z)\mathbf{e}_{z}$, $\mathbf{B}=B^{\theta}(r,z)\mathbf{e}_{\theta}$ in cylindrical coordinates, and $u^r$ satisfies $u^r&lt;\frac{1}{3r}+\frac{2r}{3}$ on the unit sphere. Our first result shows that in $\mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{0\}$, $\mathbf{u}$ is a Landau solution and $\mathbf{B}\equiv0$. Our second result establishes the triviality of axisymmetric self-similar solutions in the half-space $\mathbb{R}^3_+$ with the no-slip boundary condition or the Navier slip boundary condition.</description>

      <title>On the continuity in time and the exponential decay of solutions to a generalized Navier--Stokes--Fourier system in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the flow of a generalized Newtonian incompressible heat-conducting fluid in a bounded domain, subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for velocity and Dirichlet boundary conditions for temperature. For a fluid whose constitutive equation for the Cauchy stress follows a power law with exponent~$p$, we prove that, for~$p\ge 2$ and for initial data with finite energy, there always exists a global-in-time weak solution that additionally satisfies the entropy equality. The main novelty of this work is that we rigorously establish the continuity of temperature with respect to time, a property not previously proven in this setting. This time continuity allows us to construct a Lyapunov functional designed specifically for the problem, which in turn implies that the steady solution is nonlinearly stable and attracts all suitable weak solutions, even exponentially.</description>

For $0\leq l&lt;k&lt;n$, we establish the interior estimates and the Pogorelov type estimates. In the case $k=n$, we obtain a weaker Pogorelov type estimate for $0\leq l&lt;n-1$.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical limit of cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations for mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the semiclassical limit of cubic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations for mixed states. We justify the limit to a singular Vlasov equation (in which the force field is proportional to the gradient of the density), for data with finite Sobolev regularity whose velocity profiles satisfy a quantum Penrose stability condition. This latter condition is always satisfied for small data (with a smallness condition independent of the semiclassical parameter) both in the focusing and the defocusing case, and for small perturbations of a large class of physically relevant examples in the defocusing case, such as local Maxwellian-like profiles.</description>

      <title>A general Frobenius' Theorem via the Transport of Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result in Differential Geometry states that the flows of two smooth vector fields commute if and only if their Lie Bracket vanishes. In this work, we extend this result to a more general setting where one of the vector fields is bounded and Lipschitz, while the other may be a singular vector-valued measure, i.e. a normal 1-current. This result is achieved via the study of two distinct evolutionary PDEs describing the transport of vector quantities (the Vector Advection Equation and the Geometric Transport Equation). Furthermore, we show that a celebrated theorem by Alfv\'en in Magnetohydrodynamics can be interpreted as a suitable time-dependent version of Frobenius' Theorem. Our approach builds on recent advances concerning the Geometric Transport Equation for currents [5, 6].</description>

      <title>Constant sign and nodal solutions for singular quasilinear elliptic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider singular quasilinear elliptic systems with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Using Leray-Schauder topological degree, combined with the sub-supersolutions method and suitable truncation arguments, we establish the existence of at least three nontrivial solutions, two of which are of opposite constant sign. The third solution is nodal and exhibits components of at least opposite constant sign. In the case of a sign-coupled system, these components are of changing and synchronized sign.</description>

      <title>Nash's $G$ bound for the Kolmogorov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Nash's $G$ bound for the Kolmogorov equation with rough coefficients. Our proof is inspired by the treatment of the parabolic problem by Nash (1958) and Fabes and Stroock (1986). To transfer their ideas to the kinetic setting, we employ critical kinetic trajectories. From Nash's $G$ bound, we recover the sharp lower bound on the fundamental solution and thus provide an alternative proof of the Harnack inequality for the Kolmogorov equation.</description>

      <title>Describing smooth small-data solutions to a quasilinear hyperbolic-parabolic system by $W^{1,p}$ energy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bounded $n$-dimensonal domains with $n\ge 1$, this manuscript examines an initial-boundary value problem for the system \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  u_{tt} = \nabla \cdot (\gamma(\Theta) \nabla u_t) + a \nabla \cdot (\gamma(\Theta) \nabla u) + \nabla\cdot f(\Theta),
  \Theta_t = D\Delta\Theta + \Gamma(\Theta) |\nabla u_t|^2 + F(\Theta)\cdot \nabla u_t,
  \end{array} \right. \] which in the case $n=1$ and with $\gamma\equiv \Gamma$ as well as $f\equiv F$ reduces to the classical model for the evolution of strains and temperatures in thermoviscoelasticity. Unlike in previous related studies, the focus here is on situations in which besides $f$ and $F$, also the core ingredients $\gamma$ and $\Gamma$ may depend on the temperature variable $\Theta$.
  Firstly, a statement on local existence of classical solutions is derived for arbitrary $a&gt;0, D&gt;0$ as well as $0&lt;\gamma\in C^2([0,\infty))$ and $0\le\Gamma\in C^1([0,\infty))$, for functions $f\in C^2([0,\infty);{\mathbb{R}}^n)$ and $F\in C^1([0,\infty);{\mathbb{R}}^n)$ with $F(0)=0$, and for suitably regular initial data of arbitrary size. Secondly, it is seen that for each $p\ge 2$ such that $p&gt;n$ there exists $\delta(p)&gt;0$ with the property that whenever in addition to the above we have \[
  \frac{a}{\gamma(0)} \le \delta(p)
  \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad
  \frac{|f'(\Theta_\star)| \cdot |F(\Theta_\star)|}{D \cdot \gamma(\Theta_\star)}
  \le \delta(p), \] for initial data suitably close to the constant level given by $u=0$ and $\Theta=\Theta_\star$, with any fixed $\Theta_\star\ge 0$, these solutions are actually global in time and have the property that $\nabla u_t, \nabla u$ and $\nabla\Theta$ decay exponentially fast in $L^p$. This is achieved by detecting suitable dissipative properties of functionals involving norms of these gradients in $L^p$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Recovering Initial States in Certain Quasilinear Parabolic Problems from Time Averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse problem of reconstructing the initial state in quasilinear parabolic equations from time averages is investigated. Under suitable regularity assumptions on the quasilinear structure and a superlinear growth condition near zero for the semilinear part, it is shown that the initial state can be uniquely recovered from small time averages taken over an arbitrary time period. The applicability of the result is demonstrated for certain chemotaxis models and reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

Abstract: In this article we are considering the Hessian of the area functional in a non-Darboux chart. This does not seem to have been considered before and leads to an interesting new mathematical structure which we introduce in this article and refer to as \emph{almost extendable weak Hessian~field}.
  Our main result is a Fredholm theorem for Robbin-Salamon operators associated to \emph{non-continuous} Hessians which we prove by taking advantage of this new structure.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard scheme for solving high-dimensional drift control problems with state constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to the dynamic control of queueing networks, we develop a simulation-based scheme, the so-called multilevel Picard (MLP) approximation, for solving high-dimensional drift control problems whose states are constrained to stay within the nonnegative orthant, over a finite time horizon. We prove that under suitable conditions, the MLP approximation overcomes the curse of dimensionality in the following sense: To approximate the value function and its gradient evaluated at a given time and state to within a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$, the computational complexity grows at most polynomially in the problem dimension $d$ and $1/\varepsilon$. To illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme, we carry out numerical experiments for a class of test problems that are related to the dynamic scheduling problem of parallel server systems in heavy traffic, and demonstrate that the scheme is computationally feasible up to dimension at least $20$.</description>

      <title>A uniform-in-time nonlocal approximation of the standard Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation in which we can estimate the speed of convergence to equilibrium in a way which does not degenerate as we approach the local limit of the equation. This uniform estimate cannot be easily obtained with standard inequalities or entropy methods, but can be obtained through the use of Harris's theorem, finding interesting links to quantitative versions of the central limit theorem in probability. As a consequence one can prove that solutions of this nonlocal approximation converge to solutions of the usual Fokker-Planck equation uniformly in time-hence we show the approximation is asymptotic-preserving in this sense. The associated equilibrium has some interesting tail and regularity properties, which we also study.</description>

      <title>Low energy resolvent asymptotics of the multipole Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute low energy asymptotics for the resolvent of the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian with multiple poles for both integer and non-integer total fluxes. For integral total flux we reduce to prior results in black-box scattering while for non-integral total flux we build on the corresponding techniques using an appropriately chosen model resolvent. The resolvent expansion can be used to obtain long-time wave asymptotics for the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian with multiple poles. An interesting phenomenon is that if the total flux is an integer then the scattering resembles even-dimensional Euclidean scattering, while if it is half an odd integer then it resembles odd-dimensional Euclidean scattering. The behavior for other values of total flux thus provides an `interpolation' between these.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behavior of solutions to a doubly degenerate chemotaxis-consumption system in the two-dimensional setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work proceeds to consider the convergence of the solutions to the following doubly degenerate chemotaxis-consumption system \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{array}{r@{\,}l@{\quad}l@{\,}c} &amp;u_{t}=\nabla\cdot\big(u^{m-1}v\nabla v\big)-\nabla\cdot\big(f(u)v\nabla v\big)+\ell uv,\\ &amp;v_{t}=\Delta v-uv, \end{array}\right.%} \end{align*} under no-flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded convex domain $\Omega\subset \R^2$, where the nonnegative function $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ is asked to satisfy $f(s)\le C_fs^{\al}$ with $\al, C_f&gt;0$ for all $s\ge 1$.
  The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above system has been established in both one- and two-dimensional bounded convex domains in previous works. However, the results concerning the large time behavior are still constrained to one dimension due to the lack of a Harnack-type inequality in the two-dimensional case. In this note, we complement this result by using the Moser iteration technique and building a new Harnack-type inequality.</description>

      <title>On the surjectivity of the Cauchy-Riemann and Laplace operators on weighted spaces of smooth functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the surjectivity of the Cauchy-Riemann and Laplace operators on certain weighted spaces of smooth functions of rapid decay on strip-like domains in the complex plane that are defined via weight function systems. We fully characterize when these operators are surjective on such function spaces in terms of a growth condition on the defining weight function systems.</description>

      <title>Regularity and structure of non-planar $p$-elasticae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove regularity and structure results for $p$-elasticae in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with arbitrary $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $n\geq2$. Planar $p$-elasticae are already classified and known to lose regularity. In this paper, we show that every non-planar $p$-elastica is analytic and three-dimensional, with the only exception of flat-core solutions of arbitrary dimensions. Subsequently, we classify pinned $p$-elasticae in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and, as an application, establish a Li-Yau type inequality for the $p$-bending energy of closed curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This extends previous works for $p=2$ and $n\geq2$ as well as for $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many saturated travelling waves for a degenerate Fisher-KPP equation not in divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an epidemic model with distributed-contacts. When the contact kernel concentrates, one formally reaches a very degenerate Fisher-KPP equation with a diffusion term that is not in divergence form. We make an exhaustive study of its travelling waves. For every admissible speed, there exist not only a unique non-saturated (smooth) wave but also infinitely many saturated (sharp) ones. Furthermore their tails may differ from what is usually expected. These results are thus in sharp contrast with their counterparts on related models.</description>

      <title>Global Weak Solutions of a Thermodynamically Consistent Diffuse Interface Model for Nonhomogeneous Incompressible Two-phase Flows with a Soluble Surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a thermodynamically consistent diffuse interface model that describes the motion of a two-phase flow of two viscous incompressible Newtonian fluids with unmatched densities and a soluble surfactant in a bounded domain of two or three dimensions. The resulting hydrodynamic system consists of a nonhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system for the (volume averaged) velocity $\mathbf{u}$ and a coupled Cahn-Hilliard system for the phase-field variables $\phi$ and $\psi$ that represent the difference in volume fractions of the binary fluids and the surfactant concentration, respectively. For the initial boundary value problem with physically relevant singular potentials subject to a no-slip boundary condition for the fluid velocity and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the phase-field variables and the chemical potentials, we first establish the existence of global weak solutions in the case of non-degenerate mobilities based on a suitable semi-implicit time discretization. Next, we prove the existence of global weak solutions for a class of general degenerate mobilities, with the aid of a new type of approximations for both the mobilities and the singular parts of the potential densities.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior at infinity and existence of solutions to the Lagrangian mean curvature flow in $\mathbb R^{n+1}_-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior at infinity of ancient solutions to the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. Under conditions that admit Liouville type rigidity theorems, we prove that every classical solution converges at infinity to the sum of a quadratic polynomial in $x$ and a linear function in $t$, with an explicitly derived exponential rate of convergence. As a critical part of the proof framework of this paper, we establish the existence of a global viscosity solution with prescribed asymptotic behavior at infinity, featuring two key innovations: (i) applicability to all dimensions $n\geq 2$, and (ii) no requirement that the Hessian matrix of the prescribed quadratic term be positive definite or close to a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. These results establish the relationship between Liouville type rigidity, asymptotic analysis at infinity, and the existence of viscosity solutions.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence of weak solutions of a generalized Gross-Pitaewskii equation, with time and space dependent coefficients that could blow up or vanish asymptotically in time, with initial data not necessarily segregated. We also study the asymptotic behavior in time of these solutions, including cases in which the segregation phenomenon appears.</description>

      <title>Higher H\"older regularity for fractional $(p,q)$-Laplace equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fractional $(p,q)$-Laplace equation $$ (-\Delta_p)^s u +(-\Delta_q)^t u= 0 $$ for $s,t\in(0,1)$ and $p,q\in(1,\infty)$. We establish H\"older estimates with an explicit exponent. As a consequence, we derive a Liouville-type theorem. Our approach builds on techniques previously developed for the fractional $p$-Laplace equation, relying on a Moser-type iteration for difference quotients.</description>

      <title>Local boundedness of weak solutions to elliptic equations under unbalanced Orlicz growth conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for the local boundedness of weak solutions to a broad class of nonlinear elliptic equations in divergence form, under unbalanced growth conditions on the stress field. Our analysis is carried out in a non-variational setting, with no symmetry or structural assumptions on the operator. The ellipticity and growth are prescribed via distinct Young functions, leading to a Orlicz-type setting that captures a wide class of nonstandard behaviors. As a special case, the theory encompasses and extends the known results on equations with $p,q$-growth.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Singularities for the Damped Stochastic Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the $1+1$ dimensional damped stochastic Klein-Gordon equation, we show that random singularities associated with the law of the iterated logarithm exist and propogate in the same way as the stochastic wave equation. This provides evidence for possible connections to microlocal analysis, ie. the exact regularity and singularities described in this paper should admit wavefront set type descriptions whose propagation is determined by the highest order terms of the linear operator. Despite the results being exactly the same as those of the wave equation, our proofs are significantly different than the proofs for the wave equation. Miraculously, proving our results for the critically damped equation implies them for the general equation, which significantly simplifies the problem. Even after this simplification, many important parts of the proof are significantly different than (and we think are more intuitive from the PDE viewpoint compared to) existing proofs for the wave equation.</description>
