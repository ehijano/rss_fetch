      <title>Environment Complexity and Nash Equilibria in a Sequential Social Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods, while effective in zero-sum or positive-sum games, often yield suboptimal outcomes in general-sum games where cooperation is essential for achieving globally optimal outcomes. Matrix game social dilemmas, which abstract key aspects of general-sum interactions, such as cooperation, risk, and trust, fail to model the temporal and spatial dynamics characteristic of real-world scenarios. In response, our study extends matrix game social dilemmas into more complex, higher-dimensional MARL environments. We adapt a gridworld implementation of the Stag Hunt dilemma to more closely match the decision-space of a one-shot matrix game while also introducing variable environment complexity. Our findings indicate that as complexity increases, MARL agents trained in these environments converge to suboptimal strategies, consistent with the risk-dominant Nash equilibria strategies found in matrix games. Our work highlights the impact of environment complexity on achieving optimal outcomes in higher-dimensional game-theoretic MARL environments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Equilibria-Solving via Private Information Pre-Branch Structure in Adversarial Team Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ex ante coordinated adversarial team games (ATGs), a team competes against an adversary, and the team members are only allowed to coordinate their strategies before the game starts. The team-maxmin equilibrium with correlation (TMECor) is a suitable solution concept for ATGs. One class of TMECor-solving methods transforms the problem into solving NE in two-player zero-sum games, leveraging well-established tools for the latter. However, existing methods are fundamentally action-based, resulting in poor generalizability and low solving efficiency due to the exponential growth in the size of the transformed game. To address the above issues, we propose an efficient game transformation method based on private information, where all team members are represented by a single coordinator. We designed a structure called private information pre-branch, which makes decisions considering all possible private information from teammates. We prove that the size of the game transformed by our method is exponentially reduced compared to the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, we demonstrate equilibria equivalence. Experimentally, our method achieves a significant speedup of 182.89$\times$ to 694.44$\times$ in scenarios where the current state-of-the-art method can work, such as small-scale Kuhn poker and Leduc poker. Furthermore, our method is applicable to larger games and those with dynamically changing private information, such as Goofspiel.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for Local Search Proportional Approval Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting $k$ out of $m$ items based on the preferences of $n$ heterogeneous agents is a widely studied problem in algorithmic game theory. If agents have approval preferences over individual items and harmonic utility functions over bundles -- an agent receives $\sum_{j=1}^t\frac{1}{j}$ utility if $t$ of her approved items are selected -- then welfare optimisation is captured by a voting rule known as Proportional Approval Voting (PAV). PAV also satisfies demanding fairness axioms. However, finding a winning set of items under PAV is NP-hard. In search of a tractable method with strong fairness guarantees, a bounded local search version of PAV was proposed by Aziz et al. It proceeds by starting with an arbitrary size-$k$ set $W$ and, at each step, checking if there is a pair of candidates $a\in W$, $b\not\in W$ such that swapping $a$ and $b$ increases the total welfare by at least $\varepsilon$; if yes, it performs the swap. Aziz et al.~show that setting $\varepsilon=\frac{n}{k^2}$ ensures both the desired fairness guarantees and polynomial running time. However, they leave it open whether the algorithm converges in polynomial time if $\varepsilon$ is very small (in particular, if we do not stop until there are no welfare-improving swaps). We resolve this open question, by showing that if $\varepsilon$ can be arbitrarily small, the running time of this algorithm may be super-polynomial. Specifically, we prove a lower bound of~$\Omega(k^{\log k})$ if improvements are chosen lexicographically. To complement our lower bound, we provide an empirical comparison of two variants of local search -- better-response and best-response -- on several real-life data sets and a variety of synthetic data sets. Our experiments indicate that, empirically, better response exhibits faster running time than best response.</description>

      <title>Online Fair Allocation with Best-of-Many-Worlds Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the online fair allocation problem with sequentially arriving items under various input models, with the goal of balancing fairness and efficiency. We propose the unconstrained PACE (Pacing According to Current Estimated utility) algorithm, a parameter-free allocation dynamic that requires no prior knowledge of the input while using only integral allocations. PACE attains near-optimal convergence or approximation guarantees under stationary, stochastic-but-nonstationary, and adversarial input types, thereby achieving the first best-of-many-worlds guarantee in online fair allocation. Beyond theoretical bounds, PACE is highly simple, efficient, and decentralized, and is thus likely to perform well on a broad range of real-world inputs. Numerical results support the conclusion that PACE works well under a variety of input models. We find that PACE performs very well on two real-world datasets even under the true temporal arrivals in the data, which are highly nonstationary.</description>

      <title>CLVR Ordering of Transactions on AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trading on decentralized exchanges via an Automated Market Maker (AMM) mechanism has been massively adopted, with a daily trading volume reaching $1B. This trading method has also received close attention from researchers, central banks, and financial firms, who have the potential to adopt it to traditional financial markets such as foreign exchanges and stock markets. A critical challenge of AMM-powered trading is that transaction order has high financial value, so a policy or method to order transactions in a "good" (optimal) manner is vital. We offer economic measures of both price stability (low volatility) and inequality that inform how a "social planner" should pick an optimal ordering. We show that there is a trade-off between achieving price stability and reducing inequality, and that policymakers must choose which to prioritize. In addition, picking the optimal order can often be costly, especially when performing an exhaustive search over trade orderings (permutations). As an alternative we provide a simple algorithm, Clever Look-ahead Volatility Reduction (CLVR). This algorithm constructs an ordering which approximately minimizes price volatility with a small computation cost. We also provide insight into the strategy changes that may occur if traders are subject to this sequencing algorithm.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Machine Learning under Social and Adversarial Data Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in recent years. As machine learning permeates various aspects of daily life, individuals and organizations increasingly interact with these systems, exhibiting a wide range of social and adversarial behaviors. These behaviors may have a notable impact on the behavior and performance of machine learning systems. Specifically, during these interactions, data may be generated by strategic individuals, collected by self-interested data collectors, possibly poisoned by adversarial attackers, and used to create predictors, models, and policies satisfying multiple objectives. As a result, the machine learning systems' outputs might degrade, such as the susceptibility of deep neural networks to adversarial examples (Shafahi et al., 2018; Szegedy et al., 2013) and the diminished performance of classic algorithms in the presence of strategic individuals (Ahmadi et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is imperative for the success of machine learning in societal settings.</description>

      <title>On the Equilibrium of a Class of Leader-Follower Games with Decision-Dependent Chance Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of equilibrium in a single-leader-multiple-follower game with decision-dependent chance constraints (DDCCs), where decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) exist in the constraints of followers. DDUs refer to the uncertainties impacted by the leader's strategy, while the leader cannot capture their exact probability distributions. To address such problems, we first use decision-dependent ambiguity sets under moment information and Cantelli's inequality to transform DDCCs into second-order cone constraints. This simplifies the game model by eliminating the probability distributions. We further prove that there exists at least one equilibrium point for this game by applying Kakutani's fixed-point theorem. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the impact of DDUs on the equilibrium of such game models.</description>

      <title>Strategic Federated Learning: Application to Smart Meter Data Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) involves several clients that share with a fusion center (FC), the model each client has trained with its own data. Conventional FL, which can be interpreted as an estimation or distortion-based approach, ignores the final use of model information (MI) by the FC and the other clients. In this paper, we introduce a novel FL framework in which the FC uses an aggregate version of the MI to make decisions that affect the client's utility functions. Clients cannot choose the decisions and can only use the MI reported to the FC to maximize their utility. Depending on the alignment between the client and FC utilities, the client may have an individual interest in adding strategic noise to the model. This general framework is stated and specialized to the case of clustering, in which noisy cluster representative information is reported. This is applied to the problem of power consumption scheduling. In this context, utility non-alignment occurs, for instance, when the client wants to consume when the price of electricity is low, whereas the FC wants the consumption to occur when the total power is the lowest. This is illustrated with aggregated real data from Ausgrid \cite{ausgrid}. Our numerical analysis clearly shows that the client can increase his utility by adding noise to the model reported to the FC. Corresponding results and source codes can be downloaded from \cite{source-code}.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Multi-Proposer-Multi-Responder Ultimatum Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ultimatum Game is conventionally formulated in the context of two players. Nonetheless, real-life scenarios often entail community interactions among numerous individuals. To address this, we introduce an extended version of the Ultimatum Game, called the Multi-Proposer-Multi-Responder Ultimatum Game. In this model, multiple responders and proposers simultaneously interact in a one-shot game, introducing competition both within proposers and within responders. We derive subgame-perfect Nash equilibria for all scenarios and explore how these non-trivial values might provide insight into proposal and rejection behavior experimentally observed in the context of one vs. one Ultimatum Game scenarios. Additionally, by considering the asymptotic numbers of players, we propose two potential estimates for a "fair" threshold: either 31.8% or 36.8% of the pie (share) for the responder.</description>

      <title>Envy-freeness in 3D Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of partitioning a set of agents into coalitions based on the agents' additively separable preferences, which can also be viewed as a hedonic game. We apply three successively weaker solution concepts, namely envy-freeness, weakly justified envy-freeness, and justified envy-freeness.
  In a model in which coalitions may have any size, trivial solutions exist for these concepts, which provides a strong motivation for placing restrictions on coalition size. In this paper, we require feasible coalitions to have size three. We study the existence of partitions that are envy-free, weakly justified envy-free, and justified envy-free, and the computational complexity of finding such partitions, if they exist.
  We present a comprehensive complexity classification, in terms of the restrictions placed on the agents' preferences. From this, we identify a general trend that for the three successively weaker solution concepts, existence and polynomial-time solvability hold under successively weaker restrictions.</description>

      <title>Faster Dynamic Auctions via Polymatroid Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider dynamic auctions for finding Walrasian equilibria in markets with indivisible items and strong gross substitutes valuation functions. Each price adjustment step in these auction algorithms requires finding an inclusion-wise minimal maximal overdemanded set or an inclusion-wise minimal maximal underdemanded set at the current prices. Both can be formulated as a submodular function minimization problem.
  We observe that minimizing this submodular function corresponds to a polymatroid sum problem, and using this viewpoint, we give a fast and simple push-relabel algorithm for finding the required sets. This improves on the previously best running time of Murota, Shioura and Yang (ISAAC 2013). Our algorithm is an adaptation of the push-relabel framework by Frank and Mikl\'os (JJIAM 2012) to the particular setting. We obtain a further improvement for the special case of unit-supplies.
  We further show the following monotonicty properties of Walrasian prices: both the minimal and maximal Walrasian prices can only increase if supply of goods decreases, or if the demand of buyers increases. This is derived from a fine-grained analysis of market prices. We call "packing prices" a price vector such that there is a feasible allocation where each buyer obtains a utility maximizing set. Conversely, by "covering prices" we mean a price vector such that there exists a collection of utility maximizing sets of the buyers that include all available goods. We show that for strong gross substitutes valuations, the component-wise minimal packing prices coincide with the minimal Walrasian prices and the component-wise maximal covering prices coincide with the maximal Walrasian prices. These properties in turn lead to the price monotonicity results.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Impartial Selection with Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the impartial selection problem, a subset of agents up to a fixed size $k$ among a group of $n$ is to be chosen based on votes cast by the agents themselves. A selection mechanism is impartial if no agent can influence its own chance of being selected by changing its vote. It is $\alpha$-optimal if, for every instance, the ratio between the votes received by the selected subset is at least a fraction of $\alpha$ of the votes received by the subset of size $k$ with the highest number of votes. We study deterministic impartial mechanisms in a more general setting with arbitrarily weighted votes and provide the first approximation guarantee, roughly $1/\lceil 2n/k\rceil$. When the number of agents to select is large enough compared to the total number of agents, this yields an improvement on the previously best known approximation ratio of $1/k$ for the unweighted setting. We further show that our mechanism can be adapted to the impartial assignment problem, in which multiple sets of up to $k$ agents are to be selected, with a loss in the approximation ratio of $1/2$.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Permissionless Liquidity Provision in Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) allocate fee revenue \textit{proportional} to the amount of liquidity investors deposit. In this paper, we study the economic consequences of the competition between passive liquidity providers (LPs) caused by this allocation rule. We employ a game-theoretic model in which $N$ strategic agents optimally provide liquidity and two types of liquidity traders trade. In this setting, we find that competition drives LPs to provide excess liquidity. Excess liquidity is costly as more capital is exposed to adverse selection costs. One of our main results is that the price of anarchy, defined over the liquidity provider performance, is $O(N)$, implying that the welfare loss scales linearly with the number of liquidity providers. This inefficient capital allocation is masked when considering the welfare of elastic liquidity traders as the total price of anarchy is $O(1)$. Since this result is driven by elastic liquidity traders benefiting from the liquidity provided because of inelastic liquidity traders, we show that different types of liquidity traders complement each other. Finally, we show that AMM designs that reduce the arbitrage intensity per unit of liquidity do increase utility for liquidity traders but importantly not for LPs nor do they necessarily decrease total arbitrage volume.</description>
