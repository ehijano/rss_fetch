      <description>arXiv:2503.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review known results concerning powers and products of $(m,p)$-isometries with a view to providing elementary proofs based on properties of polynomials. We consider also the situation when $p=\infty$ where we find elements of graph theory and combinatorics arise naturally.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Independent Isolation in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isolating set of a graph is a set of vertices $S$ such that, if $S$ and its neighborhood is removed, only isolated vertices remain; and the isolation number is the minimum size of such a set. It is known that for every connected graph apart from $K_2$ and $C_5$, the isolation number is at most one-third the order and indeed such a graph has three disjoint isolating sets. In this paper we consider isolating sets where $S$ is required to be an independent set and call the minimum size thereof the independent isolation number. While for general graphs of order $n$ the independent isolation number can be arbitrarily close to $n/2$, we show that in bipartite graphs the vertex set can be partitioned into three disjoint independent isolating sets, whence the independent isolation number is at most $n/3$; while for $3$-colorable graphs the maximum value of the independent isolation number is $(n+1)/3$. We also provide a bound for $k$-colorable graphs.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proofs of the type A quiver component formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The K-theoretic quiver component formula expresses the K-polynomial of a type A quiver locus as an alternating sum of products of double Grothendieck polynomials. This formula was conjectured by A. Buch and R. Rim\'anyi and later proved by R. Kinser, A. Knutson, and the second author. We provide a new proof of this formula which replaces Gr\"obner degenerations by combinatorics. Along the way, we obtain a new proof of A. Buch and R. Rim\'anyi's cohomological quiver component formula. Again, our proof replaces geometric techniques by combinatorics.</description>

Abstract: We provide a family of $5$-dimensional prismatoids whose width grows linearly in the number of vertices. This provides a new infinite family of counter-examples to the Hirsch conjecture whose excess width grows linearly in the number of vertices, and answers a question of Matschke, Santos and Weibel.</description>

      <title>A bijection for descent sets of permutations with only even and only odd cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that, when $n$ is even, the number of permutations of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ all of whose cycles have odd length equals the number of those all of whose cycles have even length. Adin, Heged\H{u}s and Roichman recently found a surprising refinement of this identity. They showed that, for any fixed set $J$, the equality still holds when restricting to permutations with descent set $J$ on one side, and permutations with ascent set $J$ on the other. Their proof uses generating functions for higher Lie characters. They also deduce a version for odd $n$.
  Here we give a bijective proof of their result. We first use known bijections to restate the identity in terms of multisets of necklaces, and then describe a new weight-preserving bijection between words all of whose Lyndon factors have odd length and are distinct, and words all of whose Lyndon factors have even length. We also show that the corresponding equality about Lyndon factorizations has a short proof using generating functions.</description>

      <title>On tropical knapsack-type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the computational complexity of the knapsack problem and subset sum problem for the following tropical algebraic structures. We consider the semigroup of square matrices of size $k \times k$ with non-negative entries over the max-plus algebra and the semigroup square matrices of size $k \times k$ with positive entries over the max-times algebra. We prove that the knapsack problem and subset sum problem for these structures are $\textsf{NP}$-complete. We demonstrate that there are pseudo-polynomial algorithms to solve these problems. Also, we show that for the latter semigroup, there are polynomial generic algorithms to solve the knapsack problem and the subset sum problem.</description>

      <title>Triangle-free graphs with the fewest independent sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $d&gt;0$ and a positive integer $n$, let $G$ be a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with average degree $d$. With an elegant induction, Shearer (1983) tightened a seminal result of Ajtai, Koml\'os and Szemer\'edi (1980/1981) by proving that $G$ contains an independent set of size at least $(1+o(1))\frac{\log d}{d}n$ as $d\to\infty$.
  By a generalisation of Shearer's method, we prove that the number of independent sets in $G$ must be at least $\exp\left((1+o(1))\frac{(\log d)^2}{2d}n\right)$ as $d\to\infty$. This improves upon results of Cooper and Mubayi (2014) and Davies, Jenssen, Perkins, and Roberts (2018). Our method also provides good lower bounds on the independence polynomial of $G$, one of which implies Shearer's result itself. As certified by a classic probabilistic construction, our bound on the number of independent sets is sharp to several leading terms as $d\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>A Max-Min problem on spectral radius and connectedness of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decades, many scholars concerned which edge-extremal problems have spectral analogues? Recently, Wang, Kang and Xue showed an interesting result on $F$-free graphs [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 159 (2023) 20--41]. In this paper, we study the above problem on critical graphs.Let $P$ be a property defined on a family $\mathbb{G}$ of graphs. A graph $G$ in $\mathbb{G}$ is said to be $P$-critical,if it has the property $P$ but $G-e$ no longer has for any edge $e\in E(G)$. Especially, a graph is minimally $k$-(edge)-connected,if it is $k$-connected (respectively, $k$-edge connected) and deleting an arbitrary edge always leaves a graph which is not $k$-connected (respectively, $k$-edge-connected). An interesting Max-Min problem asks what is the maximal spectral radius of an $n$-vertex minimally $k$-(edge)-connected graphs? In 2019, Chen and Guo [Discrete Math. 342 (2019) 2092--2099] gave the answer for $k=2$. In 2021, Fan, Goryainov and Lin [Discrete Appl. Math. 305 (2021) 154--163] determined the extremal spectral radius for minimally $3$-connected graphs. We obtain some structural properties of minimally $k$-(edge)-connected graphs. Furthermore, we solve the above Max-Min problem for $k\geq3$, which implies that every minimally $k$-(edge)-connected graph with maximal spectral radius also has maximal number of edges. Finally, a general problem is posed for further research.</description>

      <title>On the perfect $k$-divisibility of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if, for every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, either $V(H)$ is a stable set or admits a partition into two sets $X_1$ and $X_2$ such that $\omega(H[X_1]) &lt; \omega(H)$ and $H[X_2]$ is a perfect graph. In this article, we propose the following generalisation of perfectly divisible graphs. A graph $G$ is perfectly $1$-divisible if $G$ is perfect and perfectly $k$-divisible if, for every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, either $V(H)$ is a stable set or admits a partition into two sets $X_1$ and $X_2$ such that $\omega(H[X_1]) &lt; \omega(H)$ and $H[X_2]$ is perfectly $(k-1)$-divisible, $k \in \mathbb{N}_{&gt; 1}$. Our main result establishes that every perfectly $k$-divisible graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \binom{\omega(G)+k-1}{k}$ which generalises the known bound for perfectly divisible graphs.</description>

      <title>The saturation number of wheels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be $F$-free, if $G$ does not contain any copy of $F$. $G$ is said to be $F$-semi-saturated, if the addition of any nonedge $e \not \in E(G)$ would create a new copy of $F$ in $G+e$. $G$ is said to be $F$-saturated, if $G$ is $F$-free and $F$-semi-saturated. The saturation number $sat(n,F)$ (resp. semi-saturation number $ssat(n,F)$) is the minimum number of edges in an $F$-saturated (resp. $F$-semi-saturated) graph of order $n$. In this paper we proved several results on the (semi)-saturation number of the wheel graph $W_k=K_1 \vee C_k$. Let $k,n$ be positive integers with $n \geq 56k^3$, we showed that $ssat(n,W_k)=n-1+ssat(n-1,C_k)$ for $k \geq 7$ and $sat(n,W_k)=n-1+sat(n-1,C_k)$ for $k \geq 8$. We also establish the lower bound of semi-saturation number of $W_k$ with restriction on maximum degree.</description>

      <title>On the $k$-linkage problem for generalizations of semicomplete digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A directed graph (digraph) $ D $ is $ k $-linked if $ |D| \geq 2k $, and for any $ 2k $ distinct vertices $ x_1, \ldots, x_k, y_1, \ldots, y_k $ of $ D $, there exist vertex-disjoint paths $ P_1, \ldots, P_k $ such that $ P_i $ is a path from $ x_i $ to $ y_i $ for each $ i \in [k] $. In 1980, Thomassen conjectured that there exists a function $ f(k) $ such that every $ f(k) $-strong digraph is $ k $-linked. He later disproved this conjecture by showing that $ f(2) $ does not exist for general digraphs and proved that the function $f(k)$ exists for the class of tournaments. In this paper we consider a large class $\mathcal{ D} $ of digraphs which includes all semicomplete digraphs (digraphs with no pair of non-adjacent vertices) and all quasi-transitive digraphs (a digraph $D$ is quasi-transitive if for any three vertices $x, y, z$ of $D$, whenever $xy$ and $yz$ are arcs, then $x$ and $z$ are adjacent). We prove that every $ 3k $-strong digraph $D\in \mathcal{D}$ with minimum out-degree at least $ 23k $ is $ k $-linked. A digraph $D$ is $l$-quasi-transitive if whenever there is a path of length $l$ between vertices $u$ and $v$ in $D$ the vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent. Hence 2-quasi-transitive digraphs are exactly the quasi-transitive digraphs. We prove that there is a function $f(k,l)$ so that every $f(k,l)$-strong $l$-quasi-transitive digraph is $k$-linked. The main new tool in our proofs significantly strengthens an important property of vertices with maximum in-degree in a tournament. While Landau in 1953 already proved that such a vertex $v$ is reachable by all other vertices by paths of length at most 2, we show that, in fact, the structure of these paths is much richer. In general there are many such paths for almost all out-neighbours of $v$ and this property is crucial in our proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular Automata (CA) are commonly investigated as a particular type of dynamical systems, defined by shift-invariant local rules. In this paper, we consider instead CA as algebraic systems, focusing on the combinatorial designs induced by their short-term behavior. Specifically, we review the main results published in the literature concerning the construction of mutually orthogonal Latin squares via bipermutive CA, considering both the linear and nonlinear cases. We then survey some significant applications of these results to cryptography, and conclude with a discussion of open problems to be addressed in future research on CA-based combinatorial designs.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of $\nu$-associahedra via brick polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brick polytopes constitute a remarkable family of polytopes associated to the spherical subword complexes of Knutson and Miller. They were introduced for finite Coxeter groups by Pilaud and Stump, who used them to produce geometric realizations of generalized associahedra arising from the theory of cluster algebras of finite types. In this paper, we present an application of the vast generalization of brick polyhedra for general subword complexes (not necessarily spherical) recently introduced by Jahn and Stump.
  More precisely, we show that the $\nu$-associahedron, a polytopal complex whose edge graph is the Hasse diagram of the $\nu$-Tamari lattice introduced by Pr\'eville-Ratelle and Viennot, can be geometrically realized as the complex of bounded faces of the brick polyhedron of a well chosen subword complex. We also present a suitable projection to the appropriate dimension, which leads to an elegant vertex-coordinate description.</description>

      <title>Myrvold's Results on Orthogonal Triples of $10 \times 10$ Latin Squares: A SAT Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since E. T. Parker constructed an orthogonal pair of $10\times10$ Latin squares in 1959, an orthogonal triple of $10\times10$ Latin squares has been one of the most sought-after combinatorial designs. Despite extensive work, the existence of such an orthogonal triple remains an open problem, though some negative results are known. In 1999, W. Myrvold derived some highly restrictive constraints in the special case in which one of the Latin squares in the triple contains a $4\times4$ Latin subsquare. In particular, Myrvold showed there were twenty-eight possible cases for an orthogonal pair in such a triple, twenty of which were removed from consideration. We implement a computational approach that quickly verifies all of Myrvold's nonexistence results and in the remaining eight cases finds explicit examples of orthogonal pairs -- thus explaining for the first time why Myrvold's approach left eight cases unsolved. As a consequence, the eight remaining cases cannot be removed by a strategy of focusing on the existence of an orthogonal pair; the third square in the triple must necessarily be considered as well.
  Our approach uses a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver to derive the nonexistence of twenty of the orthogonal pair types and find explicit examples of orthogonal pairs in the eight remaining cases. To reduce the existence problem into Boolean logic we use a duality between the concepts of transversal representation and orthogonal pair and we provide a formulation of this duality in terms of a composition operation on Latin squares. Using our SAT encoding, we find transversal representations (and equivalently orthogonal pairs) in the remaining eight cases in under a day of computing.</description>

      <title>Nut digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nut graph is a simple graph whose kernel is spanned by a single full vector (i.e. the adjacency matrix has a single zero eigenvalue and all non-zero kernel eigenvectors have no zero entry). We classify generalisations of nut graphs to nut digraphs: a digraph whose kernel (resp. co-kernel) is spanned by a full vector is dextro-nut (resp. laevo-nut); a bi-nut digraph is both laevo- and dextro-nut; an ambi-nut digraph is a bi-nut digraph where kernel and co-kernel are spanned by the same vector; a digraph is inter-nut if the intersection of the kernel and co-kernel is spanned by a full vector. It is known that a nut graph is connected, leafless and non-bipartite. It is shown here that an ambi-nut digraph is strongly connected, non-bipartite (i.e. has a non-bipartite underlying graph) and has minimum in-degree and minimum out-degree of at least $2$. Refined notions of core and core-forbidden vertices apply to singular digraphs. Infinite families of nut digraphs and systematic coalescence, cross-over and multiplier constructions are introduced. Relevance of nut digraphs to topological physics is discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards Transitive-free Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a digraph $D$, an arc $e=(x,y) $ in $D$ is considered transitive if there is a path from $x$ to $y$ in $D- e$. A digraph is transitive-free if it does not contain any transitive arc. In the Transitive-free Vertex Deletion (TVD) problem, the goal is to find at most $k$ vertices $S$ such that $D-S$ has no transitive arcs. In our work, we study a more general version of the TVD problem, denoted by $\ell$-Relaxed Transitive-free Vertex Deletion ($\ell$-RTVD), where we look for at most $k$ vertices $S$ such that $D-S$ has no more than $\ell$ transitive arcs. We explore $\ell$-RTVD on various well-known graph classes of digraphs such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), planar DAGs, $\alpha$-bounded digraphs, tournaments, and their multiple generalizations such as in-tournaments, out-tournaments, local tournaments, acyclic local tournaments, and obtain the following results. Although the problem admits polynomial-time algorithms in tournaments, $\alpha$-bounded digraphs, and acyclic local tournaments for fixed values of $\ell$, it remains NP-hard even in planar DAGs with maximum degree 6. In the parameterized realm, for $\ell$-RTVD on in-tournaments and out-tournaments, we obtain polynomial kernels parameterized by $k+\ell$ for bounded independence number. But the problem remains fixed-parameter intractable on DAGs when parameterized by $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, for any large enough $t$, there is a graph $G$ that admits no $K_t$-minor but admits a $(\frac32-\varepsilon)t$-colouring that is "frozen" with respect to Kempe changes, i.e. any two colour classes induce a connected component. This disproves three conjectures of Las Vergnas and Meyniel from 1981.</description>

      <title>On the Automorphism Group of Token Graphs of Complete Bipartite Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$ and let $k\in \{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$. The $k$-token graph of $G$ is the graph, whose vertices are all the $k$-subsets of vertices of $G$, where two such $k$-sets are adjacent whenever their symmetric difference is an edge of $G$. In this paper, we determine the automorphism group of the $k$-token graph of the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, several problems regarding the partition regularity of exponential configurations have been studied in the literature, in some cases using the properties of specific ultrafilters. In this paper, we start to lay down the foundations of a general theory of exponentiations of ultrafilters, with a particular focus on their combinatorial properties and the existence of idempotents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm the speculation that the distribution of $t$-hooks among unrestricted integer partitions essentially descends to self-conjugate partitions. Namely, we prove that the number of hooks of length $t$ among the size $n$ self-conjugate partitions is asymptotically normally distributed with mean
  $\mu_t(n) \sim \frac{\sqrt{6n}}{\pi} + \frac{3}{\pi^2} - \frac{t}{2}$ and variance $\sigma_t^2(n) \sim \frac{(\pi^2 - 6) \sqrt{6n}}{\pi^3}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider domino tilings of 3D cubiculated regions. The tilings have two invariants, flux and twist, often integer-valued, which are given in purely combinatorial terms. These invariants allow one to classify the tilings with respect to certain elementary moves, flips and trits. In this paper we present a construction associating a divergence-free vector field $\xi_t$ to any domino tiling $t$, such that the flux of the tiling $t$ can be interpreted as the (relative) rotation class of the field $\xi_t$, while the twist of $t$ is proved to be the relative helicity of the field $\xi_t$.</description>

      <title>On H-Intersecting Graph Families and Counting of Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work derives an upper bound on the maximum cardinality of a family of graphs on a fixed number of vertices, in which the intersection of every two graphs in that family contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to a specified graph H. Such families are referred to as H-intersecting graph families. The bound is derived using the combinatorial version of Shearer's lemma, and it forms a nontrivial extension of the bound derived by Chung, Graham, Frankl, and Shearer (1986), where H is specialized to a triangle. The derived bound is expressed in terms of the chromatic number of H, while a relaxed version, formulated using the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function of the complement of H, offers reduced computational complexity. Additionally, a probabilistic version of Shearer's lemma, combined with properties of the Shannon entropy, are employed to establish bounds related to the enumeration of graph homomorphisms, providing further insights into the interplay between combinatorial structures and information-theoretic principles.</description>

      <title>Chevalley operations on TNN Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lusztig showed that invertible totally nonnegative (TNN) matrices form a semigroup generated by positive diagonal matrices and Chevalley generators. From its Grassmann analogue, we introduce Chevalley operations on index sets, which we show have a rich variety of applications. We first completely classify all inequalities that are quadratic in Plucker coordinates over the TNN part of the Grassmannian: \[\sum_{I,J}c_{I,J}\Delta_I\Delta_J\ge 0\quad over\quad \mathrm{Gr}^{\ge 0}(m,m+n)\] where each $c_{I,J}$ is real, and $\Delta_I,\Delta_J$ are Plucker coordinates with a homogeneity condition. Using an idea of Gekhtman-Shapiro-Vainshtein, we also explain how our Chevalley operations can be motivated from cluster mutations, and lead to working in Grassmannians of smaller dimension, akin to cluster algebras.
  We then present several applications of Chevalley operations. First, we obtain certificates for the above inequalities via sums of coefficients $c_{I,J}$ over 321-avoiding permutations and involutions; we believe this refined results of Rhoades-Skandera for TNN-matrix inequalities via their Temperley-Lieb immanant idea.
  Second, we provide a novel proof via Chevalley operations of Lam's log-supermodularity of Plucker coordinates. This has several consequences: (a) Each positroid, corresponding to the positroid cells in Postnikov's decomposition of the TNN Grassmannian, is a distributive lattice. (b) It also yields numerical positivity in the main result of Lam-Postnikov-Pylyavskyy. (c) We show the coordinatewise monotonicity of ratios of Schur polynomials, first proved by Khare-Tao and which is the key result they use to obtain quantitative estimates for positivity preservers.
  Third, we employ Chevalley operations to show that the majorization order over partitions implicates a partial order for induced character immanants over TNN matrices, proved originally by Skandera-Soskin.</description>

Abstract: The weak cop number of infinite graphs can be seen as a coarse-geometric analogue to the cop number of finite graphs. We show that every vertex transitive graph with at least one thick end has infinite weak cop number. It follows that every connected, vertex transitive graph has weak cop number $1$ or $\infty$, answering a question posed by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche, and reiterated in recent preprints by Appenzeller and Klinge, and by Esperet, Gahlawat, and Giocanti.</description>

      <title>Flipper games for monadically stable graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of graphs $\mathscr{C}$ is monadically stable if for any unary expansion $\widehat{\mathscr{C}}$ of $\mathscr{C}$, one cannot interpret, in first-order logic, arbitrarily long linear orders in graphs from $\widehat{\mathscr{C}}$. It is known that nowhere dense graph classes are monadically stable; these encompass most of the studied concepts of sparsity in graphs, including graph classes that exclude a fixed topological minor. On the other hand, monadic stability is a property expressed in purely model-theoretic terms and hence it is also suited for capturing structure in dense graphs.
  For several years, it has been suspected that one can create a structure theory for monadically stable graph classes that mirrors the theory of nowhere dense graph classes in the dense setting. In this work we provide a step in this direction by giving a characterization of monadic stability through the Flipper game: a game on a graph played by Flipper, who in each round can complement the edge relation between any pair of vertex subsets, and Connector, who in each round localizes the game to a ball of bounded radius. This is an analog of the Splitter game, which characterizes nowhere dense classes of graphs (Grohe, Kreutzer, and Siebertz, J.ACM'17).
  We give two different proofs of our main result. The first proof uses tools from model theory, and it exposes an additional property of monadically stable graph classes that is close in spirit to definability of types. Also, as a byproduct, we give an alternative proof of the recent result of Braunfeld and Laskowski (arXiv 2209.05120) that monadic stability for graph classes coincides with existential monadic stability. The second proof relies on the recently introduced notion of flip-wideness (Dreier, M\"ahlmann, Siebertz, and Toru\'nczyk, ICALP 2023) and provides an efficient algorithm to compute Flipper's moves in a winning strategy.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Exchangeable Random Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the complexity of large graphs requires measures that extend beyond predefined structural features and scale efficiently with graph size. This work adopts a generative perspective, modeling large networks as exchangeable graphs to quantify the information content of their generating mechanisms via graphon entropy. As a graph property, graphon entropy is invariant under isomorphisms, making it an effective measure of complexity; however, it is not directly computable. To address this, we introduce a suite of graphon entropy estimators, including a nonparametric estimator for broad applicability and specialized versions for structured graphons arising from well-studied random graph models such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Chung-Lu, and stochastic block models. We establish their large-sample properties, deriving convergence rates and Central Limit Theorems. Simulations illustrate how the nonparametric graphon entropy estimator captures structural variations in graphs, while real-world applications demonstrate its role in characterizing evolving network dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Given a graph $G$, we define a filtration of simplicial complexes associated to $G$, $\mathcal{F}_0(G)\subseteq\mathcal{F}_1(G)\subseteq\cdots\subseteq\mathcal{F}_\infty(G)$ where the first complex is the independence complex and the last the complex is formed by the acyclic sets of vertices. We prove some properties of this filtration and we calculate the homotopy type for various families of graphs. We give an upper bound for the decycling number and generalizations of this parameter using the dimensions of the rational cohomology groups of these complexes. We also derive an upper bound for the Fibonacci numbers of ternary graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of BPS D-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles of a general toric Calabi-Yau manifold. We evaluate the Jeffrey-Kirwan residues for the flavoured Witten index for the supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics on the worldvolume of the D-branes, and find that BPS degeneracies are described by a statistical mechanical model of crystal melting. For Calabi-Yau threefolds, we reproduce the crystal melting models long known in the literature. For Calabi-Yau fourfolds, however, we find that the crystal does not contain the full information for the BPS degeneracy and we need to explicitly evaluate non-trivial weights assigned to the crystal configurations. Our discussions treat Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds on equal footing, and include discussions on elliptic and rational generalizations of the BPS states counting, connections to the mathematical definition of generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants, examples of wall crossings, and of trialities in quiver gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A LAnKe (also known as a Filippov algebra or a Lie algebra of the $n$-th kind) is a vector space equipped with a skew-symmetric $n$-linear form that satisfies the generalized Jacobi identity. Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs have shown that the symmetric group acts on the multilinear part of the free LAnKe on $2n-1$ generators as an irreducible representation. They announced that the multilinear component on $3n-2$ generators decomposes as a direct sum of two irreducible symmetric group representations and a proof was given recently in a subsequent paper by Friedmann, Hanlon and Wachs. In the present paper we provide a proof of the later statement. The two proofs are substantially different.</description>

      <title>The Role of Sequence Information in Minimal Models of Molecular Assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence-directed assembly processes - such as protein folding - allow the assembly of a large number of structures with high accuracy from only a small handful of fundamental building blocks. We aim to explore how efficiently sequence information can be used to direct assembly by studying variants of the temperature-1 abstract tile assembly model (aTAM). We ask whether, for each variant, their exists a finite set of tile types that can deterministically assemble any shape producible by a given assembly model; we call such tile type sets "universal assembly kits". Our first model, which we call the "backboned aTAM", generates backbone-assisted assembly by forcing tiles to be added to lattice positions neighbouring the immediately preceding tile, using a predetermined sequence of tile types. We demonstrate the existence of universal assembly kit for the backboned aTAM, and show that the existence of this set is maintained even under stringent restrictions to the rules of assembly. We compare these results to a less constrained model that we call sequenced aTAM, which also uses a predetermined sequence of tiles, but does not constrain a tile to neighbour the immediately preceding tiles. We prove that this model has no universal assembly kit in the stringent case. The lack of such a kit is surprising, given that the number of tile sequences of length N scales faster than both the number and worst-case Kolmogorov complexity of producible shapes of size N for a sufficiently large - but finite - set of tiles. Our results demonstrate the importance of physical mechanisms, and specifically geometric constraints, in facilitating efficient use of the information in molecular programs for structure assembly.</description>

Abstract: A fixed number of passengers independently board one of several buses uniformly at random. The lonely passenger problem is to prove that the probability of at least one passenger being the only one in their bus is increasing in the number of buses. It was solved in a strong form by Imre P\'eter T\'oth, who proved stochastic dominance of the number of such passengers as the number of buses increases, but observed that, surprisingly, no short proof was known ``despite the efforts of several experts''. We give a very short proof of the weaker result. The proof of the strong form, using the same idea, is more involved but still relatively short.</description>
