      <title>Robust double Bragg diffraction via detuning control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new theoretical model and numerical optimization of double Bragg diffraction (DBD), a widely used technique in atom interferometry. We derive an effective two-level-system Hamiltonian based on the Magnus expansion in the so-called "quasi-Bragg regime", where most Bragg-pulse atom interferometers operate. Furthermore, we extend the theory to a five-level description to account for Doppler detuning. Using these derived effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the impacts of AC-Stark shift and polarization errors on the double Bragg beam-splitter, along with their mitigations through detuning control. Notably, we design a linear detuning sweep that demonstrates robust efficiency exceeding 99.5% against polarization errors up to 8.5%. Moreover, we develop an artificial intelligence-aided optimal detuning control protocol, showcasing enhanced robustness against both polarization errors and Doppler effects. This protocol achieves an average efficiency of 99.92% for samples with a finite momentum width of 0.05$\hbar k_L$ within an extended polarization error range of up to 10%.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optical Aspects of High-Harmonic Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of electrons with strong laser fields is usually treated with semiclassical theory, where the laser is represented by an external field. There are analytic solutions for the free electron wave functions, which incorporate the interaction with the laser field exactly, but the joint effect of the atomic binding potential presents an obstacle for the analysis. Moreover, the radiation is a dynamical system, the number of photons changes during the interactions. Thus, it is legitimate to ask how can one treat the high order processes nonperturbatively, in such a way that the electron-atom interaction and the quantized nature of radiation be simultaneously taken into account? An analytic method is proposed to answer this question in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics. As an application, a quantum optical generalization of the strong-field Kramers-Heisenberg formula is derived for describing high-harmonic generation. Our formalism is suitable to analyse, among various quantal effects, the possible role of arbitrary photon statistics of the incoming field. The present paper is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Dr. Fritz Ehlotzky, who had significantly contributed to the theory of strong-field phenomena over many decades.</description>

      <title>On Hamiltonian formulations of the Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a previously successful discussion of the constrained Schr\"{o}dinger system through the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm to the case of the Dirac field. In order to follow the analogy, first we discuss the classical Dirac field as a spinorial variable, by introducing properly defined momenta and a suitably modified, factor ordered Poisson bracket. According to the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm two second class Hamiltonian constraints emerge, leading to a factor ordered Dirac bracket on the full phase space. This becomes the Poisson bracket on the reduced phase space in the canonical chart adapted to the shell. The Dirac equation is recovered both as consistency condition on the full phase space and as canonical equation on the reduced phase space. Alternatively, considering the Dirac field as odd Grassmann variable, we present the details of the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm (with either left and righ derivatives acting on Grassmann valued superfunctions and involving a different type of generalized Poisson and Dirac brackets). We propose a recipe for the canonical second quantization of all three versions of the generalized Dirac brackets, yielding the correct fundamental anticommutator.</description>

      <title>Limitations to Dynamical Error Suppression and Gate-Error Virtualization from Temporally Correlated Nonclassical Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic multi-qubit noise processes often result in error mechanisms that are not captured by the probabilistic, Markovian error models commonly employed in circuit-level analyses of quantum fault-tolerance. By working within an open-quantum system Hamiltonian formulation, we revisit the validity of the notion of a constant gate error in the presence of noise that is both {\em temporally correlated and nonclassical}, and whose impact is mitigated through perfect instantaneous dynamical decoupling subject to finite timing constraints. We study a minimal exactly solvable single-qubit model under Gaussian quantum dephasing noise, showing that the fidelity of a dynamically protected idling gate can depend strongly on its {\em location in the circuit and the history of applied control}, even when the system-side error propagation is fully removed through perfect reset operations. For digital periodic control, we prove that, under mild conditions on the low-frequency behavior of the nonclassical noise spectrum, the gate fidelity saturates at a value that is strictly smaller than the one attainable in the absence of control history; the presence of high-frequency noise peaks is also found as especially harmful, due to the possible onset of control-induced resonance effects. We explicitly relate these features to the evolution of the bath statistics during the computation, which has not been fully accounted for in existing treatments. We find that only if decoupling can keep the qubit highly pure over a timescale larger than the correlation time of the noise, the bath approximately converges to its original statistics and a stable-in-time control performance is recovered. Implications of this costly re-equilibration of the quantum bath statistics for layered quantum fault-tolerant architectures are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dynamic thermalization on noisy quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxation after a global quench is a natural way to probe thermalization in closed quantum systems. When a system relaxes after the quench, thermal observables emerge in the absence of constraints, provided long-time averaging or a large system. We demonstrate a thermalization mechanism based on averaging the observables over realizations of a global quench protocol that does not rely on a system's size or long-time evolution. The quench abruptly establishes all-to-all couplings of random strength in a few-body system and initializes the dynamics. Shortly after the quench, the observables averaged over realizations of random couplings become stationary. The average occupation probabilities of many-body energy states equilibrate toward the Gibbs distribution with a finite positive or negative absolute temperature that depends on the initial state's energy, with the negative temperatures occurring due to the confined spectrum of the system. Running an experiment on an IBM Quantum computer (IBMQ) for four qubits, we report the utility of the digital quantum computer for predicting thermal observables and their fluctuations for positive or negative absolute temperatures. Implementing thermalization on IBMQ, this result facilitates probing the dynamical emergence of thermal equilibrium and, consequently, equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Transformer Wave Function for Quantum Long-Range models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a neural-network architecture based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to find the ground states of quantum long-range models, specifically the transverse-field Ising model for spin-1/2 chains across different interaction regimes. Harnessing the transformer's capacity to capture long-range correlations, we compute the full phase diagram and critical properties of the model, in both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. Our findings show that the ViT maintains high accuracy across the full phase diagram. We compare these results with previous numerical studies in the literature and, in particular, show that the ViT has a superior performance than a restricted-Boltzmann-machine-like ansatz.</description>

      <title>Complexification of Quantum Signal Processing and its Ramifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there has been an increasing interest on the theoretical and experimental investigation of space-time dual quantum circuits. They exhibit unique properties and have applications to diverse fields. Periodic space-time dual quantum circuits are of special interest, due to their iterative structure defined by the Floquet operator. A very similar iterative structure naturally appears in Quantum Signal processing (QSP), which has emerged as a framework that embodies all the known quantum algorithms. However, it is yet unclear whether there is deeper relation between these two apparently different concepts. In this work, we establish a relation between a circuit defining a Floquet operator in a single period and its space-time dual defining QSP sequences for the Lie algebra sl$(2,\mathbb{C})$, which is the complexification of su$(2)$. First, we show that our complexified QSP sequences can be interpreted in terms of action of the Lorentz group on density matrices and that they can be interpreted as hybrid circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We also show that unitary representations of our QSP sequences exist, although they are infinite-dimensional and are defined for bosonic operators in the Heisenberg picture. Finally, we also show the relation between our complexified QSP and the nonlinear Fourier transform for sl$(2,\mathbb{C})$, which is a generalization of the previous results on su$(2)$ QSP.</description>

      <title>Entanglement across sliding-pinned transition of ion chains in optical cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative quantum systems can under appropriate conditions exhibit bi- or multi-partite entanglement at the steady state. The presence and properties of these quantum correlations depend on the relevant model parameters. Here, we characterize the steady-state entanglement in connection with the spatial structure of a small chain of three ions dispersively coupled with a pumped optical cavity. Within a semiclassical approximation, we describe the relation between entanglement, spatial organization, and vibrational modes of the ion chain. Upon increasing the pumping strength, our system undergoes a transition from a sliding to a pinned configuration, in which ions are expelled from the maxima of the optical potential. The features of the steady-state entanglement strongly depend on the kind of pinned configuration reached. We identify scenarios leading to entangled steady states, analyze the effect of defect formation upon entanglement between different system partitions, and observe the presence of multipartite quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in Trapped Bosonic Systems With Disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed study of thermalization is conducted on experimentally accessible states in a system of bosonic atoms trapped in an open linear chain with disorder. When the disorder parameter is large, the system exhibits regularity and localization. In contrast, weak disorder introduces chaos and raises questions about the validity of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), especially for states at the extremes of the energy spectrum which remain regular and non-thermalizing. The validity of ETH is assessed by examining the dispersion of entanglement entropy and the number of bosons on the first site across various dimensions, while maintaining a constant particle density of one. Experimentally accessible states in the occupation basis are categorized using a crowding parameter that linearly correlates with their mean energy. Using full exact diagonalization to simulate temporal evolution, we study the equilibration of entanglement entropy, the number of bosons, and the reduced density matrix of the first site for all states in the occupation basis. Comparing equilibrium values of these observables with those predicted by microcanonical ensembles, we find that, within certain tolerances, most states in the chaotic region thermalize. However, states with low participation ratios in the energy eigenstate basis show greater deviations from thermal equilibrium values.</description>

      <title>Multi-strategy Based Quantum Cost Reduction of Quantum Boolean Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of quantum computers is based on the synthesis of low-cost quantum circuits. The quantum circuit of any Boolean function expressed in a Positive Polarity Reed-Muller $PPRM$ expansion can be synthesized using Multiple-Control Toffoli ($MCT$) gates. This paper proposes two algorithms to construct a quantum circuit for any Boolean function expressed in a Positive Polarity Reed-Muller $PPRM$ expansion. The Boolean function can be expressed with various algebraic forms, so there are different quantum circuits can be synthesized for the Boolean function based on its algebraic form. The proposed algorithms aim to map the $MCT$ gates into the $NCV$ gates for any quantum circuit by generating a simple algebraic form for the Boolean function. The first algorithm generates a special algebraic form for any Boolean function by rearrangement of terms of the Boolean function according to a predefined degree of term $d_{term}$, then synthesizes the corresponding quantum circuit. The second algorithm applies the decomposition methods to decompose $MCT$ circuit into its elementary gates followed by applying a set of simplification rules to simplify and optimize the synthesized quantum circuit. The proposed algorithms achieve a reduction in the quantum cost of synthesized quantum circuits when compared with relevant work in literature. The proposed algorithms synthesize quantum circuits that can applied on IBM quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate two multidimensional atom interferometers capable of measuring both the magnitude and direction of applied inertial forces. These interferometers do not rely on the ubiquitous light-pulses of traditional atom sensors, but are instead built from an innovative design that operates entirely within the Bloch bands of an optical lattice formed by interfering laser beams. Through time-dependent control of the position of the lattice in three-dimensional space, we realize simultaneous Bloch oscillations in two dimensions, and a vector atomic Michelson interferometer. Fits to the observed Bloch oscillations demonstrate the measurement of an applied acceleration of $2g$ along two axes, where $g$ is the average gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface. For the Michelson interferometer, we perform Bayesian inferencing from a 49-channel output by repeating experiments for selected examples of two-axis accelerations. We demonstrate the resulting accuracy and sensitivity for vector parameter estimation. Our acceleration can be measured from a single experimental run and does not require repeated shots to construct a fringe. We find the performance of our device to be near the quantum limit for the interferometer size and quantum detection efficiency of the atoms. We discuss the reconfigurability of the vector accelerometer and the pathway toward further sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Qudit Dynamical Decoupling on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-level qudit systems are increasingly being explored as alternatives to traditional qubit systems due to their denser information storage and processing potential. However, qudits are more susceptible to decoherence than qubits due to increased loss channels, noise sensitivity, and crosstalk. To address these challenges, we develop protocols for dynamical decoupling (DD) of qudit systems based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group. We implement and experimentally verify these DD protocols on a superconducting transmon processor that supports qudit operation based on qutrits $(d=3)$ and ququarts $(d=4)$. Specifically, we demonstrate single-qudit DD sequences to decouple qutrits and ququarts from system-bath-induced decoherence. We also introduce two-qudit DD sequences designed to suppress the detrimental cross-Kerr couplings between coupled qudits. This allows us to demonstrate a significant improvement in the fidelity of time-evolved qutrit Bell states. Our results highlight the utility of leveraging DD to enable scalable qudit-based quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room temperature cavity quantum electrodynamics with molecular materials in optical cavities offers exciting prospects for controlling electronic, nuclear and photonic degrees of freedom for applications in physics, chemistry and materials science. However, achieving strong coupling with molecular ensembles typically requires high molecular densities and substantial electromagnetic field confinement. These conditions usually involve a significant degree of molecular disorder and a highly structured photonic density of states. It remains unclear to what extent these additional complexities modify the usual physical picture of strong coupling developed for atoms and inorganic semiconductors. Using a microscopic quantum description of molecular ensembles in realistic multimode optical resonators, we show that the emergence of a vacuum Rabi splitting in linear spectroscopy is a necessary but not sufficient metric of coherent admixing between light and matter. In low finesse multi-mode situations we find that molecular dipoles can be partially hybridised with photonic dissipation channels associated with off-resonant cavity modes. These vacuum-induced dissipative processes ultimately limit the extent of light-matter coherence that the system can sustain.</description>

      <title>Collectively induced transparency and absorption in waveguide QED with Bragg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective quantum states, such as subradiant and superradiant states, are useful for controlling optical responses in many-body quantum systems. In this work, we study novel collective quantum phenomena in waveguide-coupled Bragg atom arrays with inhomogeneous frequencies. For atoms without free-space dissipation, collectively induced transparency is produced by destructive quantum interference between subradiant and superradiant states. In a large Bragg atom array, multi-frequency photon transparency can be obtained by considering atoms with different frequencies. Interestingly, we find collectively induced absorption (CIA) by studying the influence of free-space dissipation on photon transport. Tunable atomic frequencies nontrivially modify decay rates of subradiant states. When the decay rate of a subradiant state equals to the free-space dissipation, photon absorption can reach a limit at a certain frequency. In other words, photon absorption is enhanced with low free-space dissipation, distinct from previous photon detection schemes. We also show multi-frequency CIA by properly adjusting atomic frequencies. Our work presents a way to manipulate collective quantum states and exotic optical properties in waveguide QED systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for partial differential equations of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial for modeling various physical phenomena such as heat transfer, fluid flow, and electromagnetic waves. In computer-aided engineering (CAE), the ability to handle fine resolutions and large computational models is essential for improving product performance and reducing development costs. However, solving large-scale PDEs, particularly for systems with spatially varying material properties, poses significant computational challenges. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving second-order linear PDEs of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters, using the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method. Our approach transforms those PDEs into ordinary differential equations represented by qubit operators, through spatial discretization using the finite difference method. Then, we provide an algorithm that efficiently constructs the operator corresponding to the spatially varying parameters of PDEs via a logic minimization technique, which reduces the number of terms and subsequently the circuit depth. We also develop a scalable method for realizing a quantum circuit for LCHS, using a tensor-network-based technique, specifically a matrix product state (MPS). We validate our method with applications to the acoustic equation with spatially varying parameters and the dissipative heat equation. Our approach includes a detailed recipe for constructing quantum circuits for PDEs, leveraging efficient encoding of spatially varying parameters of PDEs and scalable implementation of LCHS, which we believe marks a significant step towards advancing quantum computing's role in solving practical engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Decoherence without einselection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence is typically explained as an interaction with the environment that destroys coherence between the system's eigenstates, a phenomenon known as environment-induced superselection (einselection). In this work, we demonstrate that einselection and the associated envariance are actually artifacts resulting from neglecting the non-equilibrium dynamics of the apparatus. We propose a new formalism of operator dressing, which we call the stochastic matrix integral (SMI), inspired by recent developments in quantum gravity algebras. This approach naturally arises from a modified Page-Wootters (PW) formula and describes decoherence as an interacting non-equilibrium process. It leads to the reduction of the Hilbert space and the emergence of an intrinsic non-unitary process as well as Born's rule. These outcomes are achieved without relying on the assumptions of einselection and pointer basis.</description>

      <title>Observation of Space-Dependent Rotational Doppler Shifts with a Single Ion Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experiment investigating the rotational Doppler effect using a single trapped ion excited by two copropagating vortex laser beams. The setup isolates the azimuthal gradients of the fields, eliminating longitudinal and curvature effects. We provide a detailed characterization of the phenomenon by deterministically positioning a single ion across the beams, achieving a signal which depends on the angular velocity of the ion and the difference of optical orbital angular momentum between the two beams. The interpretation of the measurements is supported by numerical simulations and by a simplified analytical model. Our results reveal key properties of the rotational Doppler effect, showing that it increases approaching the center of the beam and that it is independent of the waist of the beam. This offers insights into the feasibility of super-kicks or super-Doppler shifts for sensing and manipulating atomic motion transverse to the beams' propagation direction.</description>

      <title>Measurement of microwave photon correlations at millikelvin with a thermal detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave photons are important carriers of quantum information in many promising platforms for quantum computing. They can be routinely generated, controlled, and teleported in experiments, indicating a variety of applications in quantum technology. However, observation of quantum statistical properties of microwave photons remains demanding: The energy of several microwave photons is considerably smaller than the thermal fluctuation of any room-temperature detector, while amplification necessarily induces noise. Here, we present a measurement technique with a nanobolometer that directly measures the photon statistics at millikelvin and overcomes this trade-off. We apply our method to thermal states generated by a blackbody radiator operating in the regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate the photon number resolvedness of the nanobolometer, and reveal the n(n+1)-scaling law of the photon number variance as indicated by the Bose--Einstein distribution. By engineering the coherent and incoherent proportions of the input field, we observe the transition between super-Poissonian and Poissonian statistics of the microwave photons from the bolometric second-order correlation measurement. This technique is poised to serve in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics with microwave photons and function as a scalable readout solution for a quantum information processor.</description>

      <title>Low-depth Quantum Circuit Decomposition of Multi-controlled Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-controlled gates are fundamental components in the design of quantum algorithms, where efficient decompositions of these operators can enhance algorithm performance. The best asymptotic decomposition of an n-controlled X gate with one borrowed ancilla into single qubit and CNOT gates produces circuits with degree 3 polylogarithmic depth and employs a divide-and-conquer strategy. In this paper, we reduce the number of recursive calls in the divide-and-conquer algorithm and decrease the depth of n-controlled X gate decomposition to a degree of 2.799 polylogarithmic depth. With this optimized decomposition, we also reduce the depth of n-controlled SU(2) gates and approximate n-controlled U(2) gates. Decompositions described in this work achieve the lowest asymptotic depth reported in the literature. We also perform an optimization in the base of the recursive approach. Starting at 52 control qubits, the proposed n-controlled X gate with one borrowed ancilla has the shortest circuit depth in the literature. One can reproduce all the results with the freely available open-source code provided in a public repository.</description>

      <title>Entanglement marker for lifetime of time crystal in transmon-modulated open Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the discrete time crystal (DTC) phase in a qubit ensemble, periodically driven by its interaction with either a photon or a transmon field, which is prone to dissipative leakage. We find this DTC to be robust against changes in detuning and anharmonicity of the field mode. Additionally, we study the system in the semiclassical limit, where mean-field approximations are valid, and demonstrate the utility of a suitable semiclassical Hamiltonian for this purpose. Intriguingly, we observe that the system exhibits a transient DTC even with only two qubits. We examine the dynamics of bipartite entanglement between the qubits and the field. Our findings show that the entanglement saturates to a steady value early in the dynamics, following a sudden peak. We find a strong positive correlation between this long-term entanglement value and the lifetime of the transient DTC, in a wide range of the parameter regime where the field is due to a lossy photon or a lossy transmon mode, with small detuning.</description>

      <title>Leggett-Garg Inequality for Bosons in a Double-Well Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as postulated by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impracticality of noninvasive measurements. In this work, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of direct non-Hermitian measurement and uncertainty relation towards high-dimensional quantum domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian dynamics in quantum systems have unveiled novel phenomena, yet the implementation of valid non-Hermitian quantum measurement remains a challenge, because a universal quantum projective mechanism on the complete but skewed non-Hermitian eigenstates is not explicit in experiment. This limitation hinders the direct acquisition of non-Hermitian observable statistics (e.g., non-Hermitian population dynamics), also constrains investigations of non-Hermitian quantum measurement properties such as uncertainty relation. Here, we address these challenges by presenting a non-Hermitian projective protocol and investigating the non-Hermitian uncertainty relation. We derive the uncertainty relation for pseudo-Hermitian (PH) observables that is generalized beyond the Hermitian ones. We then investigate the projective properties of general quantum states onto complete non-Hermitian eigenvectors, and present a quantum simulating method to apply the valid non-Hermitian projective measurement on a direct-sum dilated space. Subsequently, we experimentally construct a quantum simulator in the quantum optical circuit and realize the 3-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum measurement on the single-photon qutrit. Employing this platform, we explore the uncertainty relation experimentally with different PH metrics. Our non-Hermitian quantum measurement method is state-independent and outputs directly the non-Hermitian quantum projective statistics, paving the way for studies of extensive non-Hermitian observable in quantum domain.</description>

Consequently, we identify the binary observables those can be "labeled" perfectly. In this work, we study these problems in the single-shot regime.</description>

      <title>A Multiparty Quantum Private Equality Comparison scheme relying on $\ket{ GHZ_{ 3 } }$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative entanglement-based protocol that accomplishes multiparty quantum private comparison leveraging maximally entangled GHZ3 triplets. The primary motivation is the design of a protocol that can be executed by contemporary quantum computers. This is made possible because the protocol uses only GHZ3 triplets, irrespective of the number of millionaires. While more complex multi-particle entangled states are possible, they are challenging to produce with existing quantum apparatus, leading to extended preparation time and complexity, particularly in scenarios involving numerous participants. By relying on GHZ3 states, which are the easiest to produce after Bell states, we avoid these drawbacks, and take a step towards the practical implementation of the protocol. An important quantitative characteristic of this protocol is that the required quantum resources are linear both in the number of millionaires and the volume of information to be compared. A notable aspect of the protocol is its suitability for both parallel and sequential execution. Although the execution of the quantum part of the protocol is envisioned to take place completely in parallel, it is also possible to be implemented sequentially. So, if the quantum resources do not suffice for the execution of the protocol in one go, it is possible to partition the millionaires into smaller groups and process these groups sequentially. Notably, our protocol involves two third parties; Trent is now accompanied by Sophia. This dual setup allows simultaneous processing of all n millionaires' fortunes. Implementation-wise, uniformity is ensured as all millionaires use similar private quantum circuits composed of Hadamard and CNOT gates. Lastly, the protocol is information-theoretically secure, preventing outside parties from learning about fortunes or inside players from knowing each other's secret numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A particular class of quantum observable discrimination tasks, which are equivalent to identifying the outcome label associations of unlabeled observables, was introduced in [Physical Review A 109, 052415 (2024)]. In that work, the tasks were investigated within the "single-shot" regime, where a single implementation of the given measurement devices is available. In this work, we explore these tasks for non-binary observables as well as within the multiple-shot scenario, where we have access to finitely many implementations.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Generalized Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is considered in the context of Generalized Electrodynamics (GE) by Podolsky and Bopp. GE is the only extension to Maxwell electrodynamics that is locally {\normalsize{}U(1)}-gauge invariant, admits linear field equations and contains higher-order derivatives of the vector potential. GE admits both massless and massive modes for the photon. We recover the ordinary quantum phase shift of the AB effect, derived in the context of Maxwell electrodynamics, for the massless mode of the photon in GE. The massive mode induces a correction factor to the AB phase shift depending on the photon mass. We study both the magnetic AB effect and its electric counterpart. In principle, accurate experimental observations of AB the phase shift could be used to constrain GE photon mass.</description>

      <title>Physically Accessible and Inaccessible Quantum Correlations of Dirac Fields in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of Hawking decoherence on the quantum correlations of Dirac fields between \textit{Alice} and \textit{Bob}. Initially, they share a \textit{Gisin} state near the Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) in an asymptotically flat region. Then, \textit{Alice} remains stationary in this region, while \textit{Bob} hovers near the event horizon (EH) of the SBH. We expect that \textit{Bob}, using his excited detector, will detect a thermal Fermi-Dirac particle distribution. We assess the quantum correlations in the evolved \textit{Gisin} state using quantum consonance and uncertainty-induced non-locality across physically accessible, physically inaccessible, and spacetime regions. Our investigation examines how these measures vary with Hawking temperature, Dirac particle frequency, and the parameters of the initial \textit{Gisin} state. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of these quantum correlation measures across all possible regions, noting a redistribution towards the physically inaccessible region. Our findings demonstrate that Hawking decoherence reduces the quantum correlations of Dirac fields in the physically accessible region, with the extent of reduction depending on the initial state parameters. Moreover, as Hawking decoherence intensifies in the physically inaccessible and spacetime regions, the quantum correlations of Dirac fields reemerge and ultimately converge to specific values at infinite Hawking temperature. These results contribute to our understanding of quantum correlation dynamics within the framework of relativistic quantum information (RQI).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of fundamental quantum science and technologies, non-classical states of light, such as single-photon Fock states, are widely studied. However, current standards and metrological procedures are not optimized for low light levels. Progress in this crucial scientific domain depends on innovative metrology approaches, utilizing reliable devices based on quantum effects. We present a new generation of molecule-based single photon sources, combining their integration in a polymeric micro-lens with pulsed excitation schemes, thereby realizing suitable resources in quantum radiometry. Our strategy enhances the efficiency of generated single photon pulses and improves stability, providing a portable source at 784.7 nm that maintains consistent performance even through a cooling and heating cycle. The calibration of a single photon avalanche detector is demonstrated using light sources with different photon statistics, and the advantages of the single-molecule device are discussed. A relative uncertainty on the intrinsic detection efficiency well below 1 % is attained, representing a new benchmark in the field.</description>

      <title>Effective Many-body Interactions in Reduced-Dimensionality Spaces Through Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately describing properties of challenging problems in physical sciences often requires complex mathematical models that are unmanageable to tackle head-on. Therefore, developing reduced dimensionality representations that encapsulate complex correlation effects in many-body systems is crucial to advance the understanding of these complicated problems. However, a numerical evaluation of these predictive models can still be associated with a significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss a combined framework that integrates recent advances in the development of active-space representations of coupled cluster (CC) downfolded Hamiltonians with neural network approaches. The primary objective of this effort is to train neural networks to eliminate the computationally expensive steps required for evaluating hundreds or thousands of Hugenholtz diagrams, which correspond to multidimensional tensor contractions necessary for evaluating a many-body form of downfolded/effective Hamiltonians. Using small molecular systems (the H2O and HF molecules) as examples, we demonstrate that training neural networks employing effective Hamiltonians for a few nuclear geometries of molecules can accurately interpolate/ extrapolate their forms to other geometrical configurations characterized by different intensities of correlation effects. We also discuss differences between effective interactions that define CC downfolded Hamiltonians with those of bare Hamiltonians defined by Coulomb interactions in the active spaces.</description>

Abstract: Our study aims to increase the spatial resolution of high-sensitivity magnetometry based on singlet-transition infrared (IR) absorption using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds in monolithic cavities, with potential applications in bio-magnetic field detection. We develop a master-equation treatment of optically detected magnetic resonance, incorporating IR light saturation effects. This master equation provides the singlet population, which is then utilized to calculate the reflectivity and ultimately derive the magnetic field sensitivity taking into account photon and spin shot noise. We further show that our model is compatible with experiments of IR-based NV center magnetometry. Through optimization in a high-parameter space, we uncover the potential to achieve sensitivities in the order of sub-pico tesla, even for sub-millimeter scales.</description>

      <title>Improving the trainability of VQE on NISQ computers for solving portfolio optimization using convex interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving combinatorial optimization problems using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represents one of the most promising applications in the NISQ era. However, the limited trainability of VQAs could hinder their scalability to large problem sizes. In this paper, we improve the trainability of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) by utilizing convex interpolation to solve portfolio optimization. The idea is inspired by the observation that the Dicke state possesses an inherent clustering property. Consequently, the energy of a state with a larger Hamming distance from the ground state intuitively results in a greater energy gap away from the ground state energy in the overall distribution trend. Based on convex interpolation, the location of the ground state can be evaluated by learning the property of a small subset of basis states in the Hilbert space. This enlightens naturally the proposals of the strategies of close-to-solution initialization, regular cost function landscape, and recursive ansatz equilibrium partition. The successfully implementation of a $40$-qubit experiment using only $10$ superconducting qubits demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposals. Furthermore, the quantum inspiration has also spurred the development of a prototype greedy algorithm. Extensive numerical simulations indicate that the hybridization of VQE and greedy algorithms achieves a mutual complementarity, combining the advantages of both global and local optimization methods. Our proposals can be extended to improve the trainability for solving other large-scale combinatorial optimization problems that are widely used in real applications, paving the way to unleash quantum advantages of NISQ computers in the near future.</description>

      <title>Infinite quantum signal processing for arbitrary Szeg\H o functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete solution to the problem of infinite quantum signal processing for the class of Szeg\H o functions, which are functions that satisfy a logarithmic integrability condition and include almost any function that allows for a quantum signal processing representation. We do so by introducing a new algorithm called the Riemann-Hilbert-Weiss algorithm, which can compute any individual phase factor independent of all other phase factors. Our algorithm is also the first provably stable numerical algorithm for computing phase factors of any arbitrary Szeg\H o function. The proof of stability involves solving a Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem in nonlinear Fourier analysis using elements of spectral theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the chiral dynamics in a parity-time-symmetric system consisting of a giant Kerr cavity nonlocally coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. By tuning the phase difference between the two coupling points to match the propagation phase at the driving frequency, chiral cavity-waveguide interactions are achieved, enabling the deterministic generation of photons with nontrivial statistics only for a single incident direction. This nontrivial-statistical photons can be produced even in the strong dissipation regime due to the interference between reflected and transmitted photons propagating between the coupling points. Our investigation encompasses a broad range of distances between the coupling points, incorporating non-Markovian effects. Notably, at a phase difference of $\pi/2$, the system's dynamics become exactly Markovian, while the output field retains non-Markovian characteristics. Under these conditions, we analyze nonreciprocal dissipative phase transitions driven by a strong external field and elucidate the influence of the non-Markovian effect. Our results offer valuable insights for the advancement of nonreciprocal photon devices and deterministic photon generations, providing a deeper understanding of dissipative phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have proposed an arbitrary vector beam (VB) generation scheme in a thin disk-shaped quantum dot (QD) medium considering phonon interaction. The QD biexciton system exhibits interplay between first and third-order nonlinear susceptibility between two orthogonal circular polarisation transitions. Three QD transitions are coupled with one applied weak and two strong control orbital angular momentum (OAM) carrying fields. Therefore, the applied field experiences absorption, and a new field with the desired OAM is generated via four-wave mixing (FWM). These two orthogonal field superpositions produce VB at the QD medium end. We have also demonstrated the polarization rotation of a VB by changing only the relative control field phase. Additionally, we have analyzed the effect of temperature on the VB generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger cat state is important in quantum optics because of its non-Gaussian properties. This paper proposes the use of degenerate parametric scattering and measurement of the number of photons in the pump mode to conditionally prepare the Schr\"odinger cat state. This method ensures the preparation of SC in systems with weak parametric non-linear interaction. Comparison with the existing whispering mode gallery microresonator from lithium niobate indicates the possible applicability of this method.</description>

      <title>Achieving Heisenberg scaling in low-temperature quantum thermometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate correlation-enhanced low temperature quantum thermometry. Recent studies have revealed that bath-induced correlations can enhance the low-temperature estimation precision even starting from an uncorrelated state. However, a comprehensive understanding of this enhancement remains elusive. Using the Ramsey interferometry protocol, we illustrate that the estimation precision of $N$ thermometers sparsely coupled to a common low-temperature bath can achieve the Heisenberg scaling in the low-temperature regime with only a $\pi/2$ rotation of the measurement axis, in contrast to the standard Ramsey scheme. This result is based on the assumption that interthermometer correlations are induced exclusively by low-frequency noise in the common bath, a condition achievable in practical experimental scenarios. The underlying physical mechanism is clarified, revealing that the Heisenberg scaling arises from the intrinsic nature of the temperature, which is associated solely with the fluctuation of thermal noise. In contrast to the paradigm of independent thermometers, our proposed scheme demonstrates a significant enhancement in precision for low-temperature measurement, making it suitable for precisely measuring the temperature of ultracold systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay concerning distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been established for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the `entanglement Hamiltonian' or `Hamiltonian of mean force.' As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Composite Photon Blockade Based on Four-wave Mixing System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-quality single-photon blockade system can effectively enhance the quality of single-photon sources. Conventional photon blockade(CPB) suffers from low single-photon purity and high requirements for system nonlinearity, while unconventional photon blockade(UPB) has the disadvantage of low brightness. Recent research by [Laser Photon.Rev 14,1900279,2020] demonstrates that UPB can be used to enhance the strength of CPB, thereby improving the purity of single-photon sources. Research by [Opt. Express 30(12),21787,2022] shows that there is an intersection point between CPB and UPB in certain nonlinear systems, where the performance of single photons is better. In this study, we investigated the phenomenon of photon blockade in a non-degenerate four-wave mixing system, where CPB and UPB can occur simultaneously within the same parameter range. We refer to this phenomenon as composite photon blockade. Particularly, when the system achieves composite photon blockade, the value of g(2)(0) is smaller, and there are more single photons. We conducted analytical analysis and numerical calculations to study the conditions for the realization of CPB, UPB, and 2PB in the system, and discussed in detail the influence of system parameters on various blockade effects.</description>

      <title>Realizing fracton order from long-range quantum entanglement in programmable Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storing quantum information, unlike information in a classical computer, requires battling quantum decoherence, which results in a loss of information over time. To achieve error-resistant quantum memory, one would like to store the information in a quantum superposition of degenerate states engineered in such a way that local sources of noise cannot change one state into another, thus preventing quantum decoherence. One promising concept is that of fracton order -- a phase of matter with a large ground state degeneracy that grows subextensively with the system size. Unfortunately, the models realizing fractons are not friendly to experimental implementations as they require unnatural interactions between a substantial number (of the order of ten) of qubits. We demonstrate how this limitation can be circumvented by leveraging the long-range quantum entanglement created using only pairwise interactions between the code and ancilla qubits, realizable in programmable tweezer arrays of Rydberg atoms. We show that this platform also allows to detect and correct certain types of errors en route to the goal of true error-resistant quantum memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequential resonant excitation of a 2-level quantum system results in the emission of a state of light showing time-entanglement encoded in the photon-number-basis - notions that can be extended to 3-level quantum systems as discussed in a recent proposal. Here, we report the experimental implementation of a sequential two-photon resonant excitation process of a solid-state 3-level system, constituted by the biexciton-, exciton-, and ground-state of a semiconductor quantum dot. The resulting light state exhibits entanglement in time and energy, encoded in the photon-number basis, which could be used in quantum information applications, e.g., dense information encoding or quantum communication protocols. Performing energy- and time-resolved correlation experiments in combination with extensive theoretical modelling, we are able to partially retrieve the entanglement structure of the generated state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon vacancy (V$_{Si}$) centers in 4H-silicon carbide have emerged as a strong candidate for quantum networking applications due to their robust electronic and optical properties including a long spin coherence lifetime and bright, stable emission. Here, we report the integration of V$_{Si}$ centers with a plasmonic nanocavity to Purcell enhance the emission, which is critical for scalable quantum networking. Employing a simple fabrication process, we demonstrate plasmonic cavities that support a nanoscale mode volume and exhibit an increase in the spontaneous emission rate with a measured Purcell factor of up to 48. In addition to investigating the optical resonance modes, we demonstrate that an improvement in the optical stability of the spin-preserving resonant optical transitions relative to the radiation-limited value. The results highlight the potential of nanophotonic structures for advancing quantum networking technologies and emphasizes the importance of optimizing emitter-cavity interactions for efficient quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Circuit Partitioning and Transmission Cost Optimization in Distributed Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the limitations on the number of qubits in current NISQ devices, the implementation of large-scale quantum algorithms on such devices is challenging, prompting research into distributed quantum computing. This paper focuses on the issue of excessive communication complexity in distributed quantum computing oriented towards quantum circuits. To reduce the number of quantum state transmissions, i.e., the transmission cost, in distributed quantum circuits, a circuit partitioning method based on the QUBO model is proposed, coupled with the lookahead method for transmission cost optimization. Initially, the problem of distributed quantum circuit partitioning is transformed into a graph minimum cut problem. The QUBO model, which can be accelerated by quantum algorithms, is introduced to minimize the number of quantum gates between QPUs and the transmission cost. Subsequently, the dynamic lookahead strategy for the selection of transmission qubits is proposed to optimize the transmission cost in distributed quantum circuits. Finally, through numerical simulations, the impact of different circuit partitioning indicators on the transmission cost is explored, and the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that the transmission cost optimized through the method proposed in this paper is significantly reduced compared with current methods for optimizing transmission cost, achieving noticeable improvements across different numbers of partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle experiment for a new method of temperature measurements in waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) experiments, allowing one to differentiate between global and local baths. The method takes advantage of collective states of two transmon qubits located in the center of a waveguide. The Hilbert space of such a system forms two separate subspaces (bright and dark) which are coupled differently to external noise sources. Measuring transmission through the waveguide allows one to extract separately the temperatures of the baths responsible for global and local excitations in the system. Such a system would allow for building a new type of primary temperature sensor capable of distinguishing between local and global baths.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-limited Bayesian phase estimation with low-depth digital quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal phase estimation protocols require complex state preparation and readout schemes, generally unavailable or unscalable in many quantum platforms. We develop and analyze a scheme that achieves near-optimal precision up to a constant overhead for Bayesian phase estimation, using simple digital quantum circuits with depths scaling logarithmically with the number of qubits. We find that for Gaussian prior phase distributions with arbitrary widths, the optimal initial state can be approximated with products of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with varying number of qubits. Using local, adaptive measurements optimized for the prior distribution and the initial state, we show that Heisenberg scaling is achievable and that the proposed scheme outperforms known schemes in the literature that utilize a similar set of initial states. For an example prior width, we present a detailed comparison and find that is also possible to achieve Heisenberg scaling with a scheme that employs non-adaptive measurements, with the right allocation of copies per GHZ state and single-qubit rotations. We also propose an efficient phase unwinding protocol to extend the dynamic range of the proposed scheme, and show that it outperforms existing protocols by achieving an enhanced precision with a smaller number of additional atoms. Lastly, we discuss the impact of noise and imperfect gates.</description>

      <title>Tight Quantum Depth Lower Bound for Solving Systems of Linear Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd (2009) showed that a system of linear equations with $N$ variables and condition number $\kappa$ can be solved on a quantum computer in $\operatorname{poly}(\log(N), \kappa)$ time, exponentially faster than any classical algorithms, its improvements and applications have been extensively investigated. The state-of-the-art quantum algorithm for this problem is due to Costa, An, Sanders, Su, Babbush, and Berry (2022), with optimal query complexity $\Theta(\kappa)$. An important question left is whether parallelism can bring further optimization. In this paper, we study the limitation of parallel quantum computing on this problem. We show that any quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations with time complexity $\operatorname{poly}(\log(N), \kappa)$ has a lower bound of $\Omega(\kappa)$ on the depth of queries, which is tight up to a constant factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A seminal task in quantum information theory is to realize a device able to produce copies of a generic input state with the highest possible output fidelity, thus realizing an \textit{optimal} quantum cloning machine. Recently, the concept of variational quantum cloning was introduced: a quantum machine learning algorithm through which, by exploiting a classical feedback loop informed by the output of a quantum processing unit, the system can self-learn the programming required for an optimal quantum cloning strategy. In this work, we experimentally implement a $1 \rightarrow 2$ variational cloning machine of dual-rail encoded photonic qubits, both for phase-covariant and state-dependent cloning. We exploit a fully programmable 6-mode universal integrated device and classical feedback to reach near-optimal cloning performances. Our results demonstrate the potential of programmable integrated photonic platforms for variational self-learning of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Persistent coherent many-body oscillations in a non-integrable quantum Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify persistent oscillations in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain left behind by a rapid transition into a ferromagnetic phase. In the integrable chain with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions, the nature, origin, and decay of post-transition oscillations are tied to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, when coupling to the next nearest neighbor (NNN) is added, the resulting nonintegrable Ising chain (still in the quantum Ising chain universality class) supports persistent post-transition oscillation: KZM-like oscillations turn into persistent oscillations of transverse magnetization. Their longevity in our simulations is likely limited only by the numerical accuracy. Their period differs from the decaying KZM oscillation but their amplitude depends on quench rate. Moreover, they can be excited by driving in resonance with the excitations' energy gap. Thus, while one might have expected that the integrability-breaking NNN coupling would facilitate relaxation, the oscillations we identify are persistent. At low to medium transverse fields, they are associated with Cooper pairs of Bogoliubov quasiparticles -- kinks. This oscillation of the pair condensate is a manifestation of quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Continuous variable quantum teleportation using photon subtracted and photon added two mode squeezed coherent state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider non-Gaussian states generated by photon subtraction (PS) and photon addition (PA) on two-mode squeezed coherent (TMSC) states, as resource states for continuous variable (CV) quantum teleportation (QT). To this end, we derive the Wigner characteristic function for the family of photon subtracted and photon added TMSC states, which is then utilized to calculate the fidelity of teleporting a single mode coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state. The analysis shows that while symmetric PS enhances the fidelity of QT in an extensive range of squeezing, asymmetric PS enhances the performance marginally and only in the low squeezing regime. The addition operations on the other hand are less useful, symmetric three-PA leads to a marginal improvement while the other addition operations are useless. We have considered the actual experimental setup for PS and PA operations and computed their success probabilities which should be kept in mind while advocating the use of these operations. We could compute the fidelity of QT for a broad range of states because we analytically derived the Wigner characteristic function for these family of states which we think will be useful for various other applications of these families of states.</description>

      <title>Over-rotation coherent error in quantum gates subjected to pseudo twirling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation schemes (QEM) have greatly enhanced the efficiency of quantum computers, specifically focusing on reducing errors caused by interactions with the environment. Nevertheless, the presence of coherence errors, typically arising from miscalibration and inter-qubit crosstalk, is a significant challenge to the scalability of quantum computing. Such errors are often addressed using a refined Pauli twirling scheme called Randomized Compiling (RC) that converts the coherent errors into incoherent errors that can then be mitigated by conventional QEM. Unfortunately for multi-qubit gates, RC is restricted to Clifford gates such as CNOT and CPHASE. However, it has been demonstrated experimentally that a direct implementation of multi-qubit non-Clifford gates, i.e. without using multi-qubit Clifford gates, has reduced the depth of the circuit by a factor of four and more. Recently, a framework called pseudo-twirling (PST) for treating coherent error in multi-qubit non-Clifford gates has been introduced and experimentally demonstrated. We show analytically that a higher order correction to the existing PST theory yields an over-rotation coherent error generated by the PST protocol itself. This PST effect has no analogue in RC. Although the small induced over-rotation can amount to a significant coherent error in deep circuits, we explain why it does not degrade the performance of the gate.</description>

      <title>Systematic time-coarse graining for driven quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fidelity requirements on quantum devices necessitate faster and stronger drives, pushing into regimes where the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is no longer adequate. In those regimes, high-frequency processes generated by counter-rotating terms can significantly modify the long-term dynamics of a quantum system. Exploring these regimes is difficult even numerically, since system dynamics exhibiting disparate time-scales are often stiff and unstable. In this work, we present a systematic time-coarse graining (STCG) framework that addresses these issues by directly providing a Quantum Master Equation (QME) for the time-coarse grained density matrix of a driven quantum system. STCG allows the perturbative calculation of effective unitary and non-unitary generators describing the relevant slow dynamics at any given order of truncation beyond the RWA, and is accompanied by a complete software framework written in Julia, \textbf{QuantumGraining.jl}, for efficient implementation. We present three case studies examining the numerical stability, convergence and the interpretive utility of the coarse-grained QME at high orders. These examples illustrate two key results: observables measured by finite bandwidth apparatus can differ significantly from exact dynamics due to the effect of the counter-rotating terms, and that this can be captured by solving the STCG QME with basic low-order ODE solvers.</description>

      <title>Freezing and Shielding under Global Quenches for Long-Range Interacting Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of a Fermi-Hubbard model with long range hopping following a sudden quench of the local interactions among different spin species. The quasi-particle spectrum consists of gapped low-energy levels while the high energy modes accumulate at a single point. When the low energy gaps are large enough, turning on the local interactions does not effectively mix high and low energy modes, leading to the freezing of the dynamical evolution. In general, the states within the excited subspace are shielded from the long-range signatures of the model, which are responsible for the low energy extended states, and the dynamics effectively look as if long-range hopping were absent. This cooperative shielding mechanism becomes evident in presence of disorder. It is shown that shielding and freezing are a universal feature of long-range interacting systems and conjecture that they are related to the existence of quasi-stationary states.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence dynamics in stochastically fluctuating environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the decoherence of a two-level quantum system coupled to the noisy environments exhibiting linear and quadratic fluctuations within the framework of stochastic Liouville equation. It is shown that the intrinsic energy levels of the quantum system renormalize under either the linear or quadratic influence of the environmental noise. In the case of quadratic dependence, the renormalization of the energy levels of the system emerges even if the environmental noise exhibits stationary statistical property. This is in contrast to the case under linear influence, where the intrinsic energy levels of the system renormalize only if the environmental noise displays nonstationary statistics. We derive the analytical expressions of the decoherence function in the cases that the fluctuation of the frequency difference depends linearly and quadratically on the nonstationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise (OUN) and random telegraph noise (RTN) processes, respectively. In the case of linear dependence of the OUN, the environmental nonstationary statistical property can enhance the dynamical decoherence. However, the nonstationary statistics of the environmental noise can suppress the quantum decoherence in the case under the quadratic influence of the OUN. In the presence of the RTN, the quadratic influence of the environmental noise does not give rise to decoherence but only causes a determinate frequency renormalization in dynamical evolution. The environmental nonstationary statistical property can suppress the quantum decoherence for the case under the linear influence of the RTN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning utilizes quantum layers to process information within a machine learning model. However, both pure and hybrid quantum reinforcement learning face challenges such as data encoding and the use of quantum computers during the inference stage. We apply the Quantum-Train method to reinforcement learning tasks, called QTRL, training the classical policy network model using a quantum machine learning model with polylogarithmic parameter reduction. This QTRL approach eliminates the data encoding issues of conventional quantum machine learning and reduces the training parameters of the corresponding classical policy network. Most importantly, the training result of the QTRL is a classical model, meaning the inference stage only requires classical computer. This is extremely practical and cost-efficient for reinforcement learning tasks, where low-latency feedback from the policy model is essential.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Synthetic quantum matter in non-standard geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a heretofore unseen application of Ising machines to perform trust region-based optimisation with box constraints. This is done by considering a specific form of opto-electronic oscillator-based coherent Ising machines with clipped transfer functions, and proposing appropriate modifications to facilitate trust-region optimisation. The enhancements include the inclusion of non-symmetric coupling and linear terms, modulation of noise, and compatibility with convex-projections to improve its convergence. The convergence of the modified Ising machine has been shown under the reasonable assumptions of convexity or invexity. The mathematical structures of the modified Ising machine and trust-region methods have been exploited to design a new trust-region method to effectively solve unconstrained optimisation problems in many scenarios, such as machine learning and optimisation of parameters in variational quantum algorithms. Hence, the proposition is useful for both classical and quantum-classical hybrid scenarios. Finally, the convergence of the Ising machine-based trust-region method, has also been proven analytically, establishing the feasibility of the technique.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Physical Reservoir Computing for Onboard Artificial Intelligence Systems: A Perspective</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems of autonomous systems such as drones, robots and self-driving cars may consume up to 50% of total power available onboard, thereby limiting the vehicle's range of functions and considerably reducing the distance the vehicle can travel on a single charge. Next-generation onboard AI systems need an even higher power since they collect and process even larger amounts of data in real time. This problem cannot be solved using the traditional computing devices since they become more and more power-consuming. In this review article, we discuss the perspectives of development of onboard neuromorphic computers that mimic the operation of a biological brain using nonlinear-dynamical properties of natural physical environments surrounding autonomous vehicles. Previous research also demonstrated that quantum neuromorphic processors (QNPs) can conduct computations with the efficiency of a standard computer while consuming less than 1% of the onboard battery power. Since QNPs is a semi-classical technology, their technical simplicity and low, compared with quantum computers, cost make them ideally suitable for application in autonomous AI system. Providing a perspective view on the future progress in unconventional physical reservoir computing and surveying the outcomes of more than 200 interdisciplinary research works, this article will be of interest to a broad readership, including both students and experts in the fields of physics, engineering, quantum technologies and computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From fundamental studies of light-matter interaction to applications in quantum networking and sensing, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a platform-crossing toolbox to control interactions between atoms and photons. The coherence of such interactions is determined by the product of the single-pass atomic absorption and the number of photon round-trips. Reducing the cavity loss has enabled resonators supporting nearly 1-million optical roundtrips at the expense of severely limited optical material choices and increased alignment sensitivity. The single-pass absorption probability can be increased through the use of near-concentric, fiber or nanophotonic cavities, which reduce the mode waists at the expense of constrained optical access and exposure to surface fields. Here we present a new high numerical-aperture, lens-based resonator that pushes the single-atom-single-photon absorption probability per round trip close to its fundamental limit by reducing the mode size at the atom below a micron while keeping the atom mm-to-cm away from all optics. This resonator provides strong light-matter coupling in a cavity where the light circulates only ~ 10 times. We load a single 87Rb atom into such a cavity, observe strong coupling, demonstrate cavity-enhanced atom detection with imaging fidelity of 99.55(6) percent and survival probability of 99.89(4) percent in 130 microseconds, and leverage this new platform for a time-resolved exploration of cavity cooling. The resonator's loss-resilience paves the way to coupling of atoms to nonlinear and adaptive optical elements and provides a minimally invasive route to readout of defect centers. Introduction of intra-cavity imaging systems will enable the creation of cavity arrays compatible with Rydberg atom array computing technologies, vastly expanding the applicability of the cavity QED toolbox.</description>

      <title>Broadband Entangled-Photon Pair Generation with Integrated Photonics: Guidelines and A Materials Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated photon-pair sources are key components for quantum computing, networking, and sensing applications. Integrated photonics has enabled chip-scale sources using nonlinear processes, producing high-rate entanglement with sub-100 microwatt power at telecom wavelengths. Many quantum systems operate in the visible or near-infrared ranges, necessitating broadband visible-telecom entangled-pair sources for connecting remote systems via entanglement swapping and teleportation. This study evaluates broadband entanglement generation through spontaneous four-wave mixing in various nonlinear integrated photonic materials, including silicon nitride, lithium niobate, aluminum gallium arsenide, indium gallium phosphide, and gallium nitride. We demonstrate how geometric dispersion engineering facilitates phase-matching for each platform and reveals unexpected results, such as robust designs to fabrication variations and a Type-1 cross-polarized phase-matching condition for III-V materials that expands the operational bandwidth. With experimentally attainable parameters, integrated photonic microresonators with optimized designs can achieve pair generation rates greater than ~1 THz/mW$^2$.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Recombination of Ultracold Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A combined experimental and theoretical study is carried out on the three-body recombination process in a gas of microwave-shielded polar molecules. For ground-state polar molecules dressed with a strong microwave field, field-linked bound states can appear in the intermolecular potential. We model three-body recombination into such bound states using classical trajectory calculations. Our results show that recombination can explain the enhanced loss rates observed at small microwave detunings in trapped samples of bosonic NaCs [Bigagli, $\textit{et al.}$, Nat. Phys. $\textbf{19}$ 1579-1584 (2023)]. Specifically, our calculations reproduce the experimentally measured three-body loss rates across a wide range of microwave Rabi couplings, detunings, and temperatures. This work suggests that for bosonic shielded molecular systems in which the two-body loss is sufficiently suppressed and a field-linked bound state is present, the dominant loss process will be three-body recombination.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the spatial phase profile of a single-mode electromagnetic field. Our attention is on input states that are a statistical mixture of displaced and squeezed number states, a superset of Gaussian states. In particular, we derive the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) for estimating the expansion coefficients of the wavefront in an orthonormal basis, finding that it is diagonal. Moreover, we show that a measurement saturating the QFIM always exists, and point to an adaptive strategy capable of implementing it. We then construct the optimal measurements for three particular states: mixtures of photon number, coherent, and single-mode squeezed vacuum states. Sensitivity of the measurements to nuisance parameters is explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge noise is a major obstacle to improved gate fidelities in silicon spin qubits. Numerous methods exist to mitigate charge noise, including improving device fabrication, dynamical decoupling, and real-time parameter estimation. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of techniques to mitigate charge noise in semiconductor quantum dots by controlling the noise sources themselves. Using two different classical feedback methods, we stabilize an individual charged two-level fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot. These control methods reduce the low-frequency component of the noise power spectrum by an order of magnitude. These techniques also enable stabilizing the fluctuator in either of its states. In the future, such techniques may enable improved coherence times in quantum-dot spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercriticality in the Ising Model and Rydberg Atom Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercriticality, featured with universal scaling behaviors, emerges as an intriguing phenomenon proximate to the classical liquid-gas critical point. In this study, we extend this significant concept to quantum many-body systems near the quantum critical point (QCP), employing tensor network calculations and scaling analyses of the Ising model and Rydberg atom array. The supercritical, fluid-like, quantum states are found to be strongly fluctuating and highly entangled, as characterized by the universal scalings in susceptibility $\chi_z \sim (h_x-h_x^c)^{-\gamma}$, correlation length $\xi \sim (h_x-h_x^c)^{-\nu}$, fidelity susceptibility $\chi_F \sim (h_x - h_x^c)^{d\nu - 2}$, and entanglement entropy $S_{\rm E} \sim \ln{(h_x - h_x^c)}$. Here, $\gamma$ and $\nu$ represent critical exponents, $d$ is the dimension of the system, and $h_x^c$ is the critical transverse field of the Ising QCP. The universal scaling behaviors are revealed in the regime enclosed by two quantum supercritical crossover lines in the longitudinal-transverse field ($h_z$-$h_x$) plane, $|h_z| \propto (h_x - h_x^c)^{\beta + \gamma}$ relating to critical exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$, where the response functions, measures of entanglement, and fidelity susceptibility reach their maxima. We propose that Rydberg atom arrays and quantum Ising magnets provide available platforms for exploring emergent supercritical phenomena and identifying the universal scalings. The present work establishes a foundation for exploring quantum supercriticality in magnetic systems and through quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the ground state of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a square lattice with spatial anisotropy on each plaquette bond using the tensor-network method based on infinite projected entangled pair states. We find that the SU($4$) singlet ground state appears in the strongly anisotropic limit, whereas N\'eel and valence bond crystal orders coexist in the nearly isotropic limit. By examining the intermediate parameter region, we identify a phase transition between these phases. The nature of the phase transition is likely to be of first order, and the transition point is estimated to be around $J'/J\approx 0.85(5)$, where $J$ and $J'$ are the interaction strengths of intra- and inter-plaquette bonds, respectively. We also calculate the anisotropy dependence of singlet correlations on a plaquette bond, which will be useful for future experiments of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Noise Spectroscopy of Critical Slowing Down in an Atomically Thin Magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low frequency critical fluctuations in magnetic materials encode important information about the physics of magnetic ordering, especially in the associated critical exponents. While a number of techniques have been established to study magnetic critical fluctuations in bulk materials, few approaches maintain the required microscopic resolution, temporal range, and signal sensitivity to quantitatively analyze critical fluctuations in magnetic phases of 2D materials. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as quantum probes, we implement $T_2$ (spin decoherence) noise magnetometry to quantitatively study critical dynamics in a tri-layer sample of the Van der Waals magnetic material CrSBr. We characterize critical fluctuations across the magnetic phase transition in CrSBr by analyzing the NV spin echo coherence decay on time scales that approach the characteristic fluctuation correlation time $\tau_c$ at criticality, allowing us to study the temperature dependence of critical slowing down. By modelling the spin echo decoherence using theoretical models for critical dynamics, we are able to extract the critical exponent $\nu$ for the correlation length. We find a value for $\nu$ which deviates from the Ising prediction and suggests the role of long-range dipolar interactions in modifying the critical behavior of magnetic fluctuation modes in CrSBr at the 2D limit. We further compare the divergence of correlation length in CrSBr to the predicted exponential divergence for 2D XY criticality, and find evidence suggesting the possibility of such behavior in a temperature window near $T_C$ where static magnetic domains are absent. Our work provides a first demonstration of the capability of decoherence based NV noise magnetometry to quantitatively analyze critical scaling laws in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>An example of a small-time globally approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of physically relevant bilinear Schr\"odinger equations are known to be globally approximately controllable in large times. There are however examples which are globally approximately controllable in large times, but not in small times. This obstruction happens e.g. in the presence of (sub)quadratic potentials, because Gaussian states are preserved, at least for small times.
  In this work, we provide the first examples of small-time globally approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equations. In particular, we show that a control on the frequency of a quadratic potential permits to construct approximate solutions that evolve arbitrarily fast along specific transport flows, namely, space-dilations. Once we have access to space-dilations, we can exploit them to generate time-contractions. In this way, we build on previous results of large-time control, to obtain global approximate controllability in small times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A non-Hermitian complex scalar field model is considered from its $\mc{PT}$ symmetric aspect. A matrix constructed from the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion is utilized to analyze the states of the model. The model has two mass terms which determine the real or complex nature of the eigen values. A mismatch is found in the Lagrange equations of motion of the fields as the equations do not agree with the other after complex conjugation of the either. This is resolved by exploiting a preferred similarity transformation of the Lagrangian. The discrepancy even at the Hamiltonian level is found to have vanished once we consider the similarity transformed Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Wave Nonlinear Polarization Control and Signatures of Criticality in a Perovskite Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising photonic materials for fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Their potential for nonlinear optics has also drawn great interest recently; yet, to date, continuous-wave (CW) nonlinearities have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate CW nonlinear phenomena in a CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite cavity. We first demonstrate optical bistability -- the hallmark of single-mode coherent nonlinear optics. Next we exploit the interplay of nonlinearity and birefringence to demonstrate nonlinear control over the polarization of light. Finally, by measuring the optical hysteresis of our cavity as a function of temperature, we find a dramatic enhancement of the nonlinearity around 65 K. This enhancement is indicative of a phase transition in CsPbBr$_3$. Our results position CsPbBr$_3$ cavities as an exceptional platform for nonlinear optics, offering strong CW nonlinearity and birefringence which are furthermore tunable. In addition, our approach to uncover a phase transition of matter via optical hysteresis measurements is promising for exploring strongly correlated states of light-matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a random-plaquette $J_1$-$J_2$ model on the square lattice to capture the physics of a series of spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet compounds Sr$_2$CuTe$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$. With the input of experimentally relevant coupling strengths, our exact diagonalization (ED) study probes the ground state properties beyond previous linear spin-wave approach. An intermediate range of $x \in [0.08, 0.55]$ is identified for a nonmagnetic phase without the long-range N\'eel or stripe order. The absence of both valence-bond-glass order and spin-glass non-ergodic dynamics renders its nature intriguing. Deep inside this phase around $x = 0.3$, we observe signatures potentially linked to randomness-induced short-range spin-liquid-like (SLL) states, including close to zero spin-freezing parameter, vanishing spin-spin correlation beyond nearest neighbors, almost uniform static spin structure factor, as well as a broad tail in the dynamical spin structure factor. The nonmagnetic phase also features multipartite entanglement in the ground state witnessed by quantum Fisher information (QFI), which exhibits universal scaling behaviors at quantum critical points.</description>

Abstract: We give response to the question: in infinite dimension states,given a state with energy bounded by E, we can write the state as a countable convex combination of pure states with energy bounded by E. We review the Alicki-Fannes-Winter technique to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in states that are a mix of pure states with bounded energy, using this bound we conclude that for a Hamiltonian satisfying the Gibb's hypothesis such states cannot exist.</description>

Abstract: We study the recent gravitational analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for a classical system, namely a complex scalar field. We use this example to demonstrate that the Aharonov-Bohm effect in principle has nothing to do with quantum-mechanics. We then discuss how this classical field description can be connected to the standard one particle quantum description of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of ion-atom collisions beyond the ultracold regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control of microscopic physical systems is a prerequisite for experimental quantum science and its applications. Neutral atomic and molecular systems can be controlled using tunable scattering resonances. However, the resonant control of effective interactions has so far been limited to the ultracold regime, where quantum effects become manifest. Ultracold temperatures are still out of reach for most hybrid trapped ion-atom systems, a prospective platform for quantum technologies and fundamental research. Here we show that magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances can be used to control inelastic collisions between a single trapped Sr${}^+$ ion and Rb atoms high above the ultracold regime. We measure inelastic collision probabilities and use the results to calibrate a comprehensive theoretical model of ion-atom collisions. The observed collision dynamics show signatures of quantum interference, resulting in the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates in the multiple-partial-wave regime. With our model, we discover multiple measurable Feshbach resonances for magnetic fields from 0 to 400 G, which allow significant enhancement of spin-exchange rates at temperatures as high as 1 mK. Future observation of the predicted resonances should allow precise calibration and control of the short-range dynamics in the ${\text{Sr}^++\text{Rb}}$ collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.</description>

      <title>Fast and spectrally accurate construction of adaptive diagonal basis sets for electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we combine the periodic sinc basis set with a curvilinear coordinate system for electronic structure calculations. This extension allows for variable resolution across the computational domain, with higher resolution close to the nuclei and lower resolution in the inter-atomic regions. We address two key challenges that arise while using basis sets obtained by such a coordinate transformation. First, we use pseudospectral methods to evaluate the integrals needed to construct the Hamiltonian in this basis. Second, we demonstrate how to construct an appropriate coordinate transformation by solving the Monge-Amp\`ere equation using a new approach that we call the cyclic Knothe-Rosenblatt flow. The solution of both of these challenges enables mean-field calculations at a cost that is log-linear in the number of basis functions. We demonstrate that our method approaches the complete basis set limit faster than basis sets with uniform resolution. We also emphasize how these basis sets satisfy the diagonal approximation, which is shown to be a consequence of the pseudospectral method. The diagonal approximation is highly desirable for the solution of the electronic structure problem in many frameworks, including mean field theories, tensor network methods, quantum computing, and quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.04588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct pseudo-Gaussian orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \mathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu &gt;0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu &lt;0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues display intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</description>

Abstract: As quantum devices become more complex and the requirements on these devices become more demanding, it is crucial to be able to verify the performance of such devices in a scalable and reliable fashion. A cornerstone task in this challenge is quantifying how close an experimentally prepared quantum state is to the desired one. Here we present a method to construct an estimator for the quantum state fidelity that is compatible with any measurement protocol. Our method provides a confidence interval on this estimator that is guaranteed to be nearly minimax optimal for the specified measurement protocol. For a well-chosen measurement scheme, our method is competitive in the number of measurement outcomes required for estimation. We demonstrate our method using simulations and experimental data from a trapped-ion quantum computer and compare the results to state-of-the-art techniques. Our method can be easily extended to estimate the expectation value of any observable, such as entanglement witnesses.</description>

Abstract: Estimating the fidelity with a target state is important in quantum information tasks. Many fidelity estimation techniques present a suitable measurement scheme to perform the estimation. In contrast, we present techniques that allow the experimentalist to choose a convenient measurement setting. Our primary focus lies on a method that constructs an estimator with nearly minimax optimal confidence intervals for any specified measurement setting. We demonstrate, through a combination of theoretical and numerical results, various desirable properties of the method: robustness against experimental imperfections, competitive sample complexity, and accurate estimates in practice. We compare this method with Maximum Likelihood Estimation and the associated Profile Likelihood method, a Semi-Definite Programming based approach, direct fidelity estimation, quantum state verification, and classical shadows. Our method can also be used for estimating the expectation value of any observable with the same guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10672v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using near-term quantum computers to achieve a quantum advantage requires efficient strategies to improve the performance of the noisy quantum devices presently available. We develop and experimentally validate two efficient error mitigation protocols named "Noiseless Output Extrapolation" and "Pauli Error Cancellation" that can drastically enhance the performance of quantum circuits composed of noisy cycles of gates. By combining popular mitigation strategies such as probabilistic error cancellation and noise amplification with efficient noise reconstruction methods, our protocols can mitigate a wide range of noise processes that do not satisfy the assumptions underlying existing mitigation protocols, including non-local and gate-dependent processes. We test our protocols on a four-qubit superconducting processor at the Advanced Quantum Testbed. We observe significant improvements in the performance of both structured and random circuits, with up to $86\%$ improvement in variation distance over the unmitigated outputs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocols, as well as their practicality for current hardware platforms.</description>

Abstract: Reconstructing the state of quantum many-body systems is of fundamental importance in quantum information tasks, but extremely challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we present an efficient quantum tomography protocol that combines the state-factored with eigenvalue mapping to address the rank-deficient issue and incorporates a momentum-accelerated gradient descent algorithm to speed up the optimization process. We implement extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate that our factored gradient descent algorithm efficiently mitigates the rank-deficient problem and admits orders of magnitude better tomography accuracy and faster convergence. We also find that our method can accomplish the full-state tomography of random 11-qubit mixed states within one minute.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Hamiltonian Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (HQuGANs), to learn to generate unknown input quantum states using two competing quantum optimal controls. The game-theoretic framework of the algorithm is inspired by the success of classical generative adversarial networks in learning high-dimensional distributions. The quantum optimal control approach not only makes the algorithm naturally adaptable to the experimental constraints of near-term hardware, but also offers a more natural characterization of overparameterization compared to the circuit model. We numerically demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework to learn various highly entangled many-body quantum states, using simple two-body Hamiltonians and under experimentally relevant constraints such as low-bandwidth controls. We analyze the computational cost of implementing HQuGANs on quantum computers and show how the framework can be extended to learn quantum dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a new cost function that circumvents the problem of mode collapse that prevents convergence of HQuGANs and demonstrate how to accelerate the convergence of them when generating a pure state.</description>

      <title>Qafny: A Quantum-Program Verifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06411v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of the probabilistic/nondeterministic behavior of quantum programs, it is highly advisable to verify them formally to ensure that they correctly implement their specifications. Formal verification, however, also traditionally requires significant effort. To address this challenge, we present Qafny, an automated proof system based on the program verifier Dafny and designed for verifying quantum programs. At its core, Qafny uses a type-guided quantum proof system that translates quantum operations to classical array operations modeled within a classical separation logic framework. We prove the soundness and completeness of our proof system and implement a prototype compiler that transforms Qafny programs and specifications into Dafny for automated verification purposes. We then illustrate the utility of Qafny's automated capabilities in efficiently verifying important quantum algorithms, including quantum-walk algorithms, Grover's algorithm, and Shor's algorithm.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle for Entangled States of Two Identical Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11966v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we determine the consequences of the quantum entanglement of a system of two identical particles when a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is considered. GUP's are usually associated with the existence of a minimal length. We focus on the main GUP's (KMM, ADV, Pedram and Nouicer) and then we determine the minimal uncertainties in position induced by those modified GUP's. Our results point out that the minimal uncertainty is reduced by half of its usual value independently of the GUP employed. This implies that the minimal length is also reduced by half. On the other hand, it is generally expected that the minimal length must not depend on physical system. We overcome this apparent paradox by realizing that the entangled system is composed by two particles so that an effective parameter related to the minimal length must be employed.</description>

Abstract: By merging the Feynman-Vernon's approach with the out-of-equilibrium Keldysh-Schwinger formalism, we construct the reduced generating functional through which all the time-dependent correlation functions of an open fermionic system can be directly derived by applying the appropriate functional derivatives. As a concrete example, we investigate the transverse Ising model, we derive the covariance matrix at the steady state of the system and we investigate its critical behavior.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is often highlighted as one of the most promising practical applications for which quantum computers could provide a computational advantage. However, a major obstacle to the widespread use of quantum machine learning models in practice is that these models, even once trained, still require access to a quantum computer in order to be evaluated on new data. To solve this issue, we introduce a new class of quantum models where quantum resources are only required during training, while the deployment of the trained model is classical. Specifically, the training phase of our models ends with the generation of a 'shadow model' from which the classical deployment becomes possible. We prove that: i) this class of models is universal for classically-deployed quantum machine learning; ii) it does have restricted learning capacities compared to 'fully quantum' models, but nonetheless iii) it achieves a provable learning advantage over fully classical learners, contingent on widely-believed assumptions in complexity theory. These results provide compelling evidence that quantum machine learning can confer learning advantages across a substantially broader range of scenarios, where quantum computers are exclusively employed during the training phase. By enabling classical deployment, our approach facilitates the implementation of quantum machine learning models in various practical contexts.</description>

      <title>Achieving quantum metrological performance and exact Heisenberg limit precision through superposition of $s$-spin coherent states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum phase estimation, the Heisenberg limit provides the ultimate accuracy over quasi-classical estimation procedures. However, realizing this limit hinges upon both the detection strategy employed for output measurements and the characteristics of the input states. This study delves into quantum phase estimation using $s$-spin coherent states superposition. Initially, we delve into the explicit formulation of spin coherent states for a spin $s=3/2$. Both the quantum Fisher information and the quantum Cramer-Rao bound are meticulously examined. We analytically show that the ultimate measurement precision of spin cat states approaches the Heisenberg limit, where uncertainty decreases inversely with the total particle number. Moreover, we investigate the phase sensitivity introduced through operators $e^{i\zeta{S}_{z}}$, $e^{i\zeta{S}_{x}}$ and $e^{i\zeta{S}_{y}}$, subsequently comparing the resultants findings. In closing, we provide a general analytical expression for the quantum Cramer-Rao boundary applied to these three parameter-generating operators, utilizing general $s$-spin coherent states. We remarked that attaining Heisenberg-limit precision requires the careful adjustment of insightful information about the geometry of $s$-spin cat states on the Bloch sphere. Additionally, as the number of $s$-spin increases, the Heisenberg limit decreases, and this reduction is inversely proportional to the $s$-spin number.</description>

      <title>Multimode Ultrastrong Coupling in Three-Dimensional Photonic-Crystal Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have highlighted the role of spatially varying cavity electromagnetic fields in exploring novel cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) phenomena, such as the potential realization of the elusive Dicke superradiant phase transition. One-dimensional photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs), widely used for studying solid-state cQED systems, have uniform spatial profiles in the lateral plane. Three-dimensional (3D) PCCs, which exhibit discrete in-plane translational symmetry, overcome this limitation, but fabrication challenges have hindered the achievement of strong coupling in 3D-PCCs. Here, we report the realization of multimode ultrastrong coupling in a 3D-PCC at terahertz frequencies. The multimode coupling between the 3D-PCC's cavity modes and the cyclotron resonance of a Landau-quantized two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs is significantly influenced by the spatial profiles of the cavity modes, leading to distinct coupling scenarios depending on the probe polarization. Our experimental results are in excellent agreement with a multimode extended Hopfield model that accounts for the spatial inhomogeneity of the cavity field. Guided by the model, we discuss the possible strong ground-state correlations between different cavity modes and introduce relevant figures of merit for the multimode ultrastrong coupling regime. Our findings emphasize the importance of spatially nonuniform cavity mode profiles in probing nonintuitive quantum phenomena expected for the ground states of cQED systems in the ultrastrong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Multiplier Based on Exponent Adder</title>

Abstract: Quantum multiplication is a fundamental operation in quantum computing. It is important to have a quantum multiplier with low complexity. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Multiplier Based on Exponent Adder (QMbead), a new approach that requires just $\log_2(n)$ qubits to multiply two $n$-bit integer numbers, in addition to $O(n)$ ancillary qubits used for quantum state preparation. The QMbead uses a so-called exponent encoding to respectively represent two multiplicands as two superposition states which are prepared by a quantum state preparation method, then employs a quantum adder to obtain the sum of these two superposition states, and subsequently measures the outputs of the quantum adder to calculate the product of the multiplicands. Different quantum adders can be used in the QMbead. The circuit depth and time complexity of the QMbead, using a logarithmic-depth quantum carry lookahead adder (QCLA) as adder, are $O(\log n)$ and $O(n \log n)$, respectively. The gate complexity of the QMbead is $O(n)$. The circuit depth and gate complexity of the QMbead is better than existing quantum multipliers such as the quantum Karatsuba multiplier and the QFT based multiplier. The time complexity of the QMbead is identical to that of the fastest classical multiplication algorithm, Harvey-Hoeven algorithm. Interestingly, the QMbead maintains an advantage over the Harvey-Hoeven algorithm, given that the latter is only suitable for excessively large numbers, whereas the QMbead is valid for both small and large numbers. The multiplicand can be either an integer or a decimal number. The QMbead has been implemented on quantum simulators to compute products with a bit length of up to 273 bits using only 17 qubits, excluding the ancillary qubits used for quantum state preparation. This establishes QMbead as an efficient solution for multiplying large integer or decimal numbers with many bits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and study an atom-only description of the Dicke model with time-periodic couplings between atoms and a dissipative cavity mode. The cavity mode is eliminated giving rise to effective atom-atom interactions and dissipation. We use this effective description to analyze the dynamics of the atoms that undergo a transition to a dynamical superradiant phase with macroscopic coherences in the atomic medium and the light field. Using Floquet theory in combination with the atom-only description we provide a precise determination of the phase boundaries and of the dynamical response of the atoms. From this we can predict the existence of dissipative time crystals that show a subharmonic response with respect to the driving frequency. We show that the atom-only theory can describe the relaxation into such a dissipative time crystal and that the damping rate can be understood in terms of a cooling mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty relations are a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. How can these relations be found systematically? Here we make use of the state polynomial optimization framework from Klep et al. [arXiv:2301.12513] to bound the sum of squared expectation values of operators, that are subject to prescribed commutation relations. This yields a complete semidefinite programming hierarchy that converges to tight uncertainty relations. Our hierarchy applies to a wide range of scenarios including tensor-products of Pauli, Heisenberg-Weyl, and fermionic operators, as well as higher order moments.</description>

Abstract: We compare two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms that address the maximum independent set problem: one based on emergent non-abelian gauge matrix in adiabatic evolution of an energetically isolated manifold of states; and one based on designed application of single-qubit operations. We demonstrate that they are mathematically equivalent, though at first sight they appear quite different. Despite their mathematical equivalence, their most straightforward physical implementations are different. Our numerical simulations show significant differences in performance, and suggest improved experimental protocols.Intriguingly, this equivalence unveils a deeper connection. We also demonstrate that the PXP model, recently prominent in quantum dynamics research, arises as the non-abelian gauge matrix governing quantum diffusion over the median graph of all independent sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of superconducting quantum computing, based on Josephson junctions, has recently seen remarkable strides in scaling the number of logical qubits. In particular, the fidelities of one- and two-qubit gates have reached the breakeven point with the novel error mitigation and correction methods. Parallel to these advances is the effort to expand the Hilbert space within a single junction or device by employing high-dimensional qubits, otherwise known as qudits. Research has demonstrated the possibility of driving higher-order transitions in a transmon or designing innovative multimode superconducting circuits, termed multimons. These advances can significantly expand the computational basis while simplifying the interconnects in a large-scale quantum processor. In this work we extend the measurement theory of a conventional superconducting qubit to that of a qudit, focusing on modeling the dispersive quadrature measurement in an open quantum system. Under the Markov assumption, the qudit Lindblad and stochastic master equations are formulated and analyzed; in addition, both the ensemble-averaged and the quantum-jump approach of decoherence analysis are detailed with analytical and numerical comparisons. We verify our stochastic model with a series of experimental results on a transmon-type qutrit, verifying the validity of our high-dimensional formalism.</description>

Abstract: We found that fluctuations in the number of emitters lead to a super-thermal photon statistics of small LEDs in a linear regime, with a strong emitter-field coupling and a bad cavity favorable for collective effects. A simple analytical expression for the second-order correlation function g_2 is found. g_2 increase up to g_2=6 in the two-level LED model is predicted. The super-thermal photon statistics is related to the population fluctuation increase of the spontaneous emission to the cavity mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to conduct a comparative analysis between two Machine Learning approaches: Tensor Networks (TN) and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC). While both approaches share similarities in their representation of the Hilbert space using a logarithmic number of parameters, they diverge in the manifolds they cover. Thus, the aim is to evaluate and compare the expressibility and trainability of these approaches. By conducting this comparison, we can gain insights into potential areas where quantum advantage may be found. Our findings indicate that VQC exhibits advantages in terms of speed and accuracy when dealing with data, characterized by a small number of features. However, for high-dimensional data, TN surpasses VQC in overall classification accuracy. We believe that this disparity is primarily attributed to challenges encountered during the training of quantum circuits. We want to stress that in this article, we focus on only one particular task and do not conduct thorough averaging of the results. Consequently, we recommend considering the results of this article as a unique case without excessive generalization.</description>

Abstract: The study of percolation phenomena has various applications ranging from social networks or materials science to quantum information. The most common percolation models are bond- or site-percolation for which the Newman-Ziff algorithm enables an efficient simulation. Here, we consider several non-standard percolation models that appear in the context of measurement-based photonic quantum computing with so-called graph states and fusion networks. The associated percolation thresholds determine the tolerance to photon loss in such systems and we develop modifications of the Newman-Ziff algorithm to perform the corresponding percolation simulation efficiently. We demonstrate our algorithms by using them to characterize exemplary fusion networks and graph states. The used source code is provided as an open-source repository.</description>

Abstract: Rapid advances in quantum computing technology lead to an increasing need for software simulators that enable both algorithm design and the validation of results obtained from quantum hardware. This includes calculations that aim at probing regimes of quantum advantage, where a quantum computer outperforms a classical computer in the same task. High performance computing (HPC) platforms play a crucial role as today's quantum devices already reach beyond the limits of what powerful workstations can model, but a systematic evaluation of the individual performance of the many offered simulation packages is lacking so far. In this Technical Review, we benchmark several software packages capable of simulating quantum dynamics with a special focus on HPC capabilities. We develop a containerized toolchain for benchmarking a large set of simulation packages on a local HPC cluster using different parallelisation capabilities, and compare the performance and system size-scaling for three paradigmatic quantum computing tasks. Our results can help finding the right package for a given simulation task and lay the foundation for a systematic community effort to benchmark and validate upcoming versions of existing and also newly developed simulation packages.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional topological effect in a transmon qubit array with tunable couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a square-lattice architecture of superconducting transmon qubits with inter-qubit interactions mediated by inductive couplers. Therein, the inductive couling between the qubit and couplers is suggested to be designed into the gradiometer form to intigimate the flux noise orginating from the environment. Via periodically modulating the couplers,the Abelian gauge potential, termed effective magnetic flux, can be synthesized artificially, making the system an excellent platform for simulating two-dimensional topological physics. In the simplest two-dimensional model, the double (or three-leg) ladder, the staggered vortex-Meissner phase transition different from that in the two-leg ladder can be found in the single-particle ground state as the effective magnetic flux varies. Besides, the large coupling ratio between the interleg and intraleg coupling strengths also makes the chiral current resemble squeezed sinusoidal functions. If the row number is further increased, the topological band structure anticipated at massive rows begins to occur even for a relatively small number of rows (ten or so for the considered parameters). This heralds a small circuit scale to observe the topological band. The edge state in the band gap is determined by the topological Chern number and can be calculated through integrating the Berry curvature with respect to the first Brillouin zone. Besides, we present a systematic method on how to measure the topological band structure based on time- and space-domain Frourier transformation of the wave function after properly excited. The result offers an avenue for simulating two-dimensional topological physics on the state-of-the-art superconducting quantum chips.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum operations and ancilla-based readout for tweezer clocks</title>

Abstract: Enhancing the precision of measurements by harnessing entanglement is a long-sought goal in the field of quantum metrology. Yet attaining the best sensitivity allowed by quantum theory in the presence of noise is an outstanding challenge, requiring optimal probe-state generation and readout strategies. Neutral atom optical clocks, leading systems for measuring time, have shown recent progress in terms of entanglement generation, but currently lack the control capabilities to realize such schemes. Here we show universal quantum operations and ancilla-based readout for ultranarrow optical transitions of neutral atoms. Our demonstration in a tweezer clock platform enables a circuit-based approach to quantum metrology with neutral atom optical clocks. To this end, we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates with 99.62% fidelity via Rydberg interactions and dynamical connectivity for optical clock qubits, which we combine with local addressing to implement universally programmable quantum circuits. Using this approach, we generate a near-optimal entangled probe state, a cascade of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of different sizes, and perform dual-quadrature GHZ readout. We also show repeated fast phase detection with non-destructive conditional reset of clock qubits and minimal dead time between repetitions by implementing ancilla-based quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) for neutral atoms. Finally, we extend this to multi-qubit parity checks and measurement-based, heralded, Bell state preparation. Our work lays the foundation for hybrid processor-clock devices with neutral atoms and more generally points to a future of practical applications for quantum processors linked with quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of diverse methodologies for portfolio optimization leveraging quantum annealing techniques</title>

Abstract: Portfolio optimization (PO) is extensively employed in financial services to assist in achieving investment objectives. By providing an optimal asset allocation, PO effectively balances the risk and returns associated with investments. However, it is important to note that as the number of involved assets and constraints increases, the portfolio optimization problem can become increasingly difficult to solve, falling into the category of NP-hard problems. In such scenarios, classical algorithms, such as the Monte Carlo method, exhibit limitations in addressing this challenge when the number of stocks in the portfolio grows. Quantum annealing algorithm holds promise for solving complex portfolio optimization problems in the NISQ era. Many studies have demonstrated the advantages of various quantum annealing algorithm variations over the standard quantum annealing approach. In this work, we conduct a numerical investigation of randomly generated unconstrained single-period discrete mean-variance portfolio optimization instances. We explore the application of a variety of unconventional quantum annealing algorithms, employing both forward annealing and reverse annealing schedules. By comparing the time-to-solution(TTS) and success probabilities of diverse approaches, we show that certain methods exhibit advantages in enhancing the success probability when utilizing conventional forward annealing schedules. Furthermore, we find that the implementation of reverse annealing schedules can significantly improve the performance of select unconventional quantum annealing algorithms.</description>

      <title>State Estimation and Control for Stochastic Quantum Dynamics with Homodyne Measurement: Stabilizing Qubits under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Lyapunov-based control approach with homodyne measurement. We study two filtering approaches: (i) the traditional quantum filtering and (ii) a modified version of the extended Kalman filtering. We examine both methods in order to directly estimate the evolution of the coherence vector elements, using sequential homodyne current measurements. The latter case explicitly addresses the dynamics of a stochastic master equation with correlated noise, transformed into a state-space representation, ensuring by construction the quantum properties of the estimated state variable. In addition, we consider the case where the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian is unknown, and the system experiences uncertainties. In this case, we show as expected that both filters lose performance, exhibiting large expected estimation errors. To address this problem, we propose a simple multiple model estimation scheme that can be directly applied to any of the studied filters. We then reconstruct the estimated density operator \( \hat{\rho} \), describing the full state of the system, and subject it to a control scheme. The proposed switching-based Lyapunov control scheme, which is fed with \( \hat{\rho} \), guarantees noise-to-state practically stable in probability of the desired stationary target set with respect to the estimation error variance. We demonstrate our approach's efficacy in stabilizing a qubit coupled to a leaky cavity under homodyne detection in the presence of uncertainty in resonance frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09224v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general theory based upon 6 postulates is introduced. The basical notions are theoretical variables that are associated with an observer or with a group of communicating observers. These variables may be accessible or inaccessible. From these postulates, the ordinary formalism of quantum theory is derived. The mathematical derivations are not given in this article, but I refer to the recent articles [9, 10]. Three possible applications of the general theory can be given; 1) The variables may decision variables connected to the decisions of a person or of a group of persons. 2) The variables may be statistical parameters or future data, But most importantly here: 3) The variables are physical variables in some context. This last application gives a completely new foundation of quantum mechanics, a foundation which in my opinion is much more easy to understand than the ordinary formalism.The other applications seem also to give interesting consequences of the approach. Socalled paradoxes like that of Schr\"odinger's cat can be clarified under the theory. Explanations of the outcomes of David Bohm's version of the EPR experiment and of the Bell experiment are provided. Finally, references to links towards relativity theory and to quantum field theory are given. The concluding remarks point at further possible developments.</description>

      <title>From Stochastic Hamiltonian to Quantum Simulation: Exploring Memory Effects in Exciton Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unraveling of open quantum system dynamics in terms of stochastic quantum trajectories offers a picture of open system dynamics that consistently considers memory effects stemming from the finite correlation time of environment fluctuations. These fluctuations significantly influence the coherence and energy transport properties of excitonic systems. When their correlation time is comparable to the timescale of the Hamiltonian evolution, it leads to the departure of open system dynamics from the Markovian limit. In this work, we leverage the unraveling of exciton dynamics through stochastic Hamiltonian propagators to design quantum circuits that simulate exciton transport, capturing finite memory effects. In addition to enabling the synthesis of parametrizable quantum circuits, stochastic unitary propagators provide a transparent framework for investigating non-Markovian effects on exciton transport. Our analysis reveals a nuanced relationship between environment correlation time and transport efficiency, identifying a regime of "memory-assisted" quantum transport where time-correlated fluctuations allow the system to reach higher efficiency. However, this property is not universal and can only be realized in conjunction with specific features of the system Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic quantum devices offer a novel approach to realize quantum computations, where the quantum two-level system (qubit) is replaced with the quantum (an)harmonic oscillator (qumode) as the fundamental building block of the quantum simulator. The simulation of chemical structure and dynamics can then be achieved by representing or mapping the system Hamiltonians in terms of bosonic operators. In this perspective, we review recent progress and future potential of using bosonic quantum devices for addressing a wide range of challenging chemical problems, including the calculation of molecular vibronic spectra, the simulation of gas-phase and solution-phase adiabatic and nonadiabatic chemical dynamics, the efficient solution of molecular graph theory problems, and the calculations of electronic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rationally independent free fermions are those where sums of single-particle energies multiplied by arbitrary rational coefficients vanish only if the coefficients are all zero. This property guaranties that they have no degeneracies in the many-body spectrum and gives them relaxation properties more similar to those of generic systems. Using classic results from number theory we provide minimal examples of rationally independent free fermion models for every system size in one dimension. This is accomplished by considering a free fermion model with a chemical potential, and hopping terms corresponding to all the divisors of the number of sites, each one with an incommensurate complex amplitude. We further discuss the many-body spectral statistics for these models and show that local probes -- like the ratio of consecutive level spacings -- look very similar to what is expected for the Poisson statistics. We however demonstrate that free fermion models can never have Poisson statistics with an analysis of the moments of the spectral form factor.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantumness of gravitational cat states in correlated dephasing channels. Our focus is on exploring how classical correlations between successive actions of a dephasing channel influence the decoherence of two gravitational cats (two qubits) at a thermal regime. The results show that the quantum coherence, local quantum Fisher information, and Bell non-locality can be significantly enhanced by augmenting classical correlations throughout the entire duration when the two qubits pass the channel. However, the gravitational interaction and energy gap between states exhibit intricate impacts on the quantum characteristics of gravitational cats. New features are reported that can be significant for both gravitational physics and quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the crucial generic techniques for quantum computation is amplitude encoding. Although several approaches have been proposed, each of them often requires exponential classical-computational cost or an oracle whose explicit construction is not provided. Given the growing demands for practical quantum computation, we develop moderately specialized encoding techniques that generate an arbitrary linear combination of localized complex functions. We demonstrate that $n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ discrete Lorentzian functions as an expansion basis set lead to eficient probabilistic encoding, whose computational time is $\mathcal{O}( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_{\mathrm{loc}},n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_q, n_q ))$ for $n_q$ data qubits equipped with $\log_2 n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ ancillae. Furthermore, amplitude amplification in combination with amplitude reduction renders it deterministic analytically with controllable errors and the computational time is reduced to $\mathcal{O}( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_{\mathrm{loc}}, n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_q, n_q )).$ We estimate required resources for applying our scheme to quantum chemistry in real space. We also show the results on real superconducting quantum computers to confirm the validity of our techniques.</description>

      <title>The strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics of quantum Brownian motion based on the exact solution of its reduced density matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the quantum thermodynamics of quantum Brownian motion from the exact solution of its reduced density matrix. We start from the total equilibrium thermal state between the Brownian particle and its reservoir, and solve analytically and exactly the reduced density matrix of the system by taking the partial trace over all the reservoir states. We find that the reduced Hamiltonian and the reduced partition function of the Brownian motion must be renormalized significantly, as shown in the general nonperturbative renormalization theory of quantum thermodynamics for open quantum systems we developed recently [Phys. Rev. Res. 4, 023141 (2022)]. The reduced Hamiltonian contains not only a frequency shift but also a squeezing pairing interaction, where a momentum-dependent potential is generated naturally from the strong coupling between the Brownian particle and the reservoir, after traced over all the reservoir states. The resulting exact reduced density matrix of the Brownian motion is given by a squeezing thermal state. Moreover, beyond the weak coupling limit, in order to obtain correctly the reduced partition function of the Brownian motion, one must take into account the non-negligible changes of the reservoir state induced by the system-reservoir coupling. Using the exact solutions of the reduced density matrix, the reduced Hamiltonian as well as the reduced partition function of the Brownian motion, we show that the controversial results obtained from the different definitions of internal energy and the issue of the negative heat capacity in the previous studies of strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics are resolved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when the remaining ion is dressed by a field. As was recently shown, the doublet can be interpreted as a signature of quantum entanglement between photoelectrons and strongly coupled ions. However, the dressed state nature of the ion prevents detection of the entanglement by straightforward coincidence detection. Here, we find that odd (zero-area) envelopes can substantially delay the generation of entanglement, but also modify the dynamics such that the doublet transforms into unique channel-resolved photoelectron distributions. Because these distributions can be used to correlate with the internal state of the ion, our proposed scheme opens up for detection of quantum entanglement, between photoelectrons and stongly-coupled ions, without a need for quantum phase measurements.</description>

      <title>Generalized R\'enyi entropy accumulation theorem and generalized quantum probability estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropy accumulation theorem, and its subsequent generalized version, is a powerful tool in the security analysis of many device-dependent and device-independent cryptography protocols. However, it has the drawback that the finite-size bounds it yields are not necessarily optimal, and furthermore it relies on the construction of an affine min-tradeoff function, which can often be challenging to construct optimally in practice. In this work, we address both of these challenges simultaneously by deriving a new entropy accumulation bound. Our bound yields significantly better finite-size performance, and can be computed as an intuitively interpretable convex optimization, without any specification of affine min-tradeoff functions. Furthermore, it can be applied directly at the level of R\'enyi entropies if desired, yielding fully-R\'enyi security proofs. Our proof techniques are based on elaborating on a connection between entropy accumulation and the frameworks of quantum probability estimation or $f$-weighted R\'enyi entropies, and in the process we obtain some new results with respect to those frameworks as well. In particular, those findings imply that our bounds apply to prepare-and-measure protocols without the virtual tomography procedures or repetition-rate restrictions previously required for entropy accumulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a fundamental role in quantum physics and information processing. Here, we develop an unbiased estimator for mixed-state entanglement in the few-shot scenario and directly estimate it using random unitary evolution in a photonic system. As a supplement to traditional projective measurements, we incorporate Bell measurements on qubit-pairs, enriching the previous randomized measurement scheme, which is no-go in this task with only local unitary evolution. The scheme is scalable to n-qubits via Bell measurements on qubit-pairs. The estimator can be derived directly from a few consecutive outcomes while exhibiting greater robustness to system errors and noise compared to schemes based on shadow estimation. We find that, under a fixed measurement resource, the way with more versatile measurement settings with fewer repeats per setting is more efficient. Our protocol and demonstration advance the direct characterization of quantum states in practice.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the quantum Ising model on two-dimensional square lattices up to $16 \times 16$ spins. In the ordered phase, the model is predicted to exhibit dynamically constrained dynamics, leading to confinement of elementary excitations and slow thermalization. After demonstrating the signatures of confinement, we probe the dynamics of interfaces in the constrained regime through sudden quenches of product states with domains of opposite magnetization. We find that the nature of excitations can be captured by perturbation theory throughout the confining regime, and identify the crossover to the deconfining regime. We systematically explore the effect of the transverse field on the modes propagating along flat interfaces and investigate the crossover from resonant to diffusive melting of a square of flipped spins embedded in a larger lattice.</description>

      <title>Efficient Chromatic-Number-Based Multi-Qubit Decoherence and Crosstalk Suppression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of quantum computers is hindered by decoherence and crosstalk, which cause errors and limit the ability to perform long computations. Dynamical decoupling is a technique that alleviates these issues by applying carefully timed pulses to individual qubits, effectively suppressing unwanted interactions. However, as quantum devices grow in size, it becomes increasingly important to minimize the time required to implement dynamical decoupling across the entire system. Here, we present ``Chromatic-Hadamard Dynamical Decoupling'' (CHaDD), an approach that efficiently schedules dynamical decoupling pulses for quantum devices with arbitrary qubit connectivity. By leveraging Hadamard matrices, CHaDD achieves a circuit depth that scales linearly with the chromatic number of the connectivity graph for general two-qubit interactions, assuming instantaneous pulses. This includes ZZ crosstalk, which is prevalent in superconducting qubit devices. CHaDD's scaling represents an exponential improvement over all previous multi-qubit decoupling schemes for devices with connectivity graphs whose chromatic number grows at most polylogarithmically with the number of qubits. For graphs with a constant chromatic number, CHaDD's scaling is independent of the number of qubits. Our results suggest that CHaDD can become a useful tool for enhancing the performance and scalability of quantum computers by efficiently suppressing decoherence and crosstalk across large qubit arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Paczos et al. (Phys. Rev. D 109 (2024)) proposed a covariant quantum field theory for free and interacting tachyon fields. We show that the proposed Feynman propagator leads to unitarity violation in the 1-loop mass renormalization of an ordinary particle it interacts with, proper asymptotic (in/out) tachyon states do not exist, and the proposed S-matrix describing interactions of tachyons and subluminal matter is ill-defined. Since tachyons behave as bosons, interacting tachyons may also self-interact, e.g., any interaction with ordinary matter generates such terms. As a result, the physical vacuum, instead of being at the origin of the potential, may correspond to the proper minimum of the tachyon potential, or such state does not exist at all. Our analysis indicates that quantum tachyon field does not describe a physical on-shell particle with negative mass squared.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for 1-matric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of Krylov complexity, a measure of operator growth, within the framework of 1-matrix quantum mechanics (1-MQM). Krylov complexity quantifies how an operator evolves over time by expanding it in a series of nested commutators with the Hamiltonian. We analyze the Lanczos coefficients derived from the correlation function, revealing their linear growth even in this integrable system. This growth suggests a link to chaotic behavior, typically unexpected in integrable systems. Our findings in both ground and thermal states of 1-MQM provide new insights into the nature of complexity in quantum mechanical models and lay the groundwork for further studies in more complex holographic theories.</description>

      <title>qLUE: A Quantum Clustering Algorithm for Multi- Dimensional Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms are at the basis of several technological applications, and are fueling the development of rapidly evolving fields such as machine learning. In the recent past, however, it has become apparent that they face challenges stemming from datasets that span more spatial dimensions. In fact, the best-performing clustering algorithms scale linearly in the number of points, but quadratically with respect to the local density of points. In this work, we introduce qLUE, a quantum clustering algorithm that scales linearly in both the number of points and their density. qLUE is inspired by CLUE, an algorithm developed to address the challenging time and memory budgets of Event Reconstruction (ER) in future High-Energy Physics experiments. As such, qLUE marries decades of development with the quadratic speedup provided by quantum computers. We numerically test qLUE in several scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness and proving it to be a promising route to handle complex data analysis tasks -- especially in high-dimensional datasets with high densities of points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-terminal quantum spin-Hall heat engine and refrigerator with embedded Majorana bound states (MBS) are analyzed for optimality in thermoelectric performance. The occurrence of MBS can enhance the performance to rival, as well as outperform, some modern nanoscale quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators. The optimal performance of this MBS quantum heat engine and quantum refrigerator can be further enhanced by an Aharonov-Bohm flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19685v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning-based approach for numerical simulation of a time-evolving Schr\"odinger equation inspired by stochastic mechanics and generative diffusion models. Unlike existing approaches, which exhibit computational complexity that scales exponentially in the problem dimension, our method allows us to adapt to the latent low-dimensional structure of the wave function by sampling from the Markovian diffusion. Depending on the latent dimension, our method may have far lower computational complexity in higher dimensions. Moreover, we propose novel equations for stochastic quantum mechanics, resulting in quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of dimensions. Numerical simulations verify our theoretical findings and show a significant advantage of our method compared to other deep-learning-based approaches used for quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>A corner-cube-feedback Faraday laser with 8 kHz linewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A single-mode Cs atom 852 nm Faraday laser based on the corner cube feedback is demonstrated, and termed as corner-cube-feedback Faraday laser. Using the corner-cube retroreflector as external cavity feedback element in Faraday laser, mechanical robustness can be greatly improved due to the precise reflection of the incident light beam back to its original direction. This Faraday laser can achieve laser oscillation at a large angle, which between the incident light and the optical axis of corner cube, ranging from +3{\deg} to -3{\deg}. The most probable linewidth is 8 kHz measured by heterodyne beating with two identical lasers. Moreover, its output frequency remains close to the Cs atomic Doppler-broadened transition line, even though the diode current changes from 55 mA to 155 mA and the diode working temperature varies from 11.8 to 37.2 degrees Celsius. The corner-cube-feedback Faraday laser with high mechanical robustness as well as narrow linewidth can be widely used in quantum precision measurement, such as atomic clocks, atomic gravimeters, and atomic magnetometers, etc.</description>

      <title>Infinite dimensional analogues of Choi matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a class of linear maps on a von Neumann factor, we associate two objects, bounded operators and trace class operators, both of which play the roles of Choi matrices. Each of them is positive if and only if the original map on the factor is completely positive. They are also useful to characterize positivity of maps as well as complete positivity. It turns out that such correspondences are possible for every normal completely bounded map if and only if the factor is of type I. As an application, we provide criteria for Schmidt numbers of normal positive functionals in terms of Choi matrices of $k$-positive maps, in infinite dimensional cases. We also define the notion of $k$-superpositive maps, which turns out to be equivalent to the property of $k$-partially entanglement breaking.</description>

      <title>Strong zero modes in integrable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a classic result that certain interacting integrable spin chains host robust edge modes known as strong zero modes (SZMs). In this work, we extend this result to the Floquet setting of local quantum circuits, focusing on a prototypical model providing an integrable Trotterization for the evolution of the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. By exploiting the algebraic structures of integrability, we show that an exact SZM operator can be constructed for these integrable quantum circuits in certain regions of parameter space. Our construction, which recovers a well-known result by Paul Fendley in the continuous-time limit, relies on a set of commuting transfer matrices known from integrability, and allows us to easily prove important properties of the SZM, including normalizabilty. Our approach is different from previous methods and could be of independent interest even in the Hamiltonian setting. Our predictions, which are corroborated by numerical simulations of infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, are potentially interesting for implementations of the XXZ quantum circuit on available quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum state of fields in $SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity ($SU(\infty)$-QGR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our Universe is ruled by quantum mechanics and should be treated as a quantum system. {$SU(\infty)$-QGR is a recently proposed quantum model for the Universe, in which gravity is associated to $SU(\infty)$ symmetry of its Hilbert space. Clustering/blockization of its infinite dimensional state due to random quantum fluctuations divides the Universe to approximately isolated subsystems. In addition to parameters of their {\it internal} finite rank symmetries, states and dynamics of subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters, and the perceived classical spacetime is their effective representation, reflecting quantum states of subsystems and their relative evolution. At lowest order the effective Lagrangian of {$SU(\infty)$-QGR has the form of Yang-Mills gauge theories for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries defined on the aforementioned 4D parameter space. In the present work we study more thoroughly some of the fundamental aspects of {$SU(\infty)$-QGR. Specifically, we clarify impact of the degeneracy of $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$; describe mixed states of subsystems and their purification; calculate measures of their entanglement to the rest of the Universe; and discuss their role in the emergence of local gauge symmetries. We also describe the relationship between what is called {\it internal space} of $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills with the 4D parameter space, and analytically demonstrate irrelevance of the geometry of parameter space for physical observables. Along with these topics, we demonstrate the equivalence of two sets of criteria for compositeness of a quantum system, and show uniqueness of the limit of various algebras leading to $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$.</description>

      <title>A reappraisal of Lagrangians with non-quadratic velocity dependence and branched Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians with non-quadratic velocity dependence have found attention in the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlation of Hawking radiations for mass-superposed BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies using the Unruh-DeWitt detector model have revealed the quantum signatures of black hole mass superposition. In this paper, we use the equal-time density-density correlation function to reinvestigate the mass superposition of BTZ black holes. Interestingly, the quantum signatures of BTZ black hole mass superposition can be revealed by the equal-time density-density correlation peaks. Additionally, different mass superpositions for the same mass ratio can be distinguished, a phenomenon not previously documented. Specifically, the correlation function method can pinpoint the location where Hawking radiations are generated, even for mass-superposed BTZ black holes. Our findings indicate that this location is approximately at two and a half times the radius of the horizon, where the correlation function reaches its maximum.This supports the concept of a quantum atmosphere as the origin locus of Hawking radiation,even in quantum-superposed spacetimes.</description>
