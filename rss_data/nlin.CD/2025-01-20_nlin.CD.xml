      <title>Efficient detection of chaos through the computation of the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) by the multi-particle method</title>

Abstract: We present a method for the computation of the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI), a fast and effective chaos indicator, using a multi-particle approach that avoids variational equations. We show that this approach is robust and accurate by deriving a leading-order error estimation for both the variational (VM) and the multi-particle (MPM) methods, which we validate by performing extensive numerical simulations on two prototypical models: the two degrees of freedom H\'enon-Heiles system and the multidimensional $\beta$-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain of oscillators. The dependence of the accuracy of the GALI on control parameters such as the renormalization time, the integration time step and the deviation vector size is studied in detail. We test the MPM implemented with double precision accuracy ($\varepsilon \approx 10^{-16}$) and find that it performs reliably for deviation vector sizes $d_0\approx \varepsilon^{1/2}$, renormalization times $\tau \lesssim 1$, and relative energy errors $E_r \lesssim \varepsilon^{1/2}$. These results hold for systems with many degrees of freedom and demonstrate that the MPM is a robust and efficient method for studying the chaotic dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Our work makes it possible to explore chaotic dynamics with the GALI in a vast number of systems by eliminating the need for variational equations.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Limit of Resonance States in Chaotic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonance states in quantum chaotic scattering systems have a multifractal structure that depends on their decay rate. We show how classical dynamics describes this structure for all decay rates in the semiclassical limit. This result for chaotic scattering systems corresponds to the well-established quantum ergodicity for closed chaotic systems. Specifically, we generalize Ulam's matrix approximation of the Perron-Frobenius operator, giving rise to conditionally invariant measures of various decay rates. There are many matrix approximations leading to the same decay rate and we conjecture a criterion for selecting the one relevant for resonance states. Numerically, we demonstrate that resonance states in the semiclassical limit converge to the selected measure. Example systems are a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering system, and open quantum maps.</description>

      <title>Holographic deep thermalization: theory and experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomness is a cornerstone of science, underpinning fields such as statistics, information theory, dynamical systems, and thermodynamics. In quantum science, quantum randomness, especially random pure states, plays a pivotal role in fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine $5$-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of $8$ qubits.</description>
