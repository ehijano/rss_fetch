      <title>Model Category Structure on Simplicial Algebras via Dold-Kan Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This expository article sets forth a self-contained and purely algebraic proof of a deep result of Quillen stating that the category of simplicial commutative algebras over a commutative ring is a model category. This is accomplished by starting from the model structure on the category of connective chain complexes, transferring it to the category of simplicial modules via Dold-Kan Correspondence, and further transferring it to the category of simplicial commutative algebras through Quillen-Kan Transfer Machine. The subtlety of overcoming the acyclicity condition is addressed by introducing and studying the shuffle product of connective chain complexes, establishing a variant of Eilenberg-Zilber Theorem, and carefully scrutinizing the subtle structures under study.</description>

      <title>Free extensivity via distributivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the canonical pseudodistributive law between various free limit completion pseudomonads and the free coproduct completion pseudomonad. When the class of limits includes pullbacks, we show that this consideration leads to notions of extensive categories. More precisely, we show that extensive categories with pullbacks and infinitary lextensive categories are the pseudoalgebras for the pseudomonads resulting from the pseudodistributive laws. Moreover, we introduce the notion of doubly-infinitary lextensive category, and we establish that the freely generated such categories are cartesian closed. From this result, we further deduce that, in freely generated infinitary lextensive categories, the objects with a finite number of connected components are exponentiable. We conclude our work with remarks on descent theoretical aspects of this work, along with results concerning non-canonical isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Clones, closed categories, and combinatory logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an exposition of the semantics of the simply-typed lambda-calculus, and its linear and ordered variants, using multi-ary structures. We define universal properties for multicategories, and use these to derive familiar rules for products, tensors, and exponentials. Finally we explain how to recover both the category-theoretic syntactic model and its semantic interpretation from the multi-ary framework.
  We then use these ideas to study the semantic interpretation of combinatory logic and the simply-typed lambda-calculus without products. We introduce extensional SK-clones and show these are sound and complete for both combinatory logic with extensional weak equality and the simply-typed lambda-calculus without products. We then show such SK-clones are equivalent to a variant of closed categories called SK-categories, so the simply-typed lambda-calculus without products is the internal language of SK-categories. As a corollary, we deduce that SK-categories have the same relationship to cartesian monoidal categories that closed categories have to monoidal categories.</description>

      <title>A resolution theorem for extriangulated categories with applications to the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quillen's Resolution Theorem in algebraic $K$-theory provides a powerful computational tool for calculating $K$-groups of exact categories. At the level of $K_0$, this result goes back to Grothendieck. In this article, we first establish an extriangulated version of Grothendieck's Resolution Theorem.
  Second, we use this Extriangulated Resolution Theorem to gain new insight into the index theory of triangulated categories. Indeed, we propose an index with respect to an extension-closed subcategory $\mathscr{N}$ of a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$ and we prove an additivity formula with error term. Our index recovers the index with respect to a contravariantly finite, rigid subcategory $\mathscr{X}$ defined by J{\o}rgensen and the second author, as well as an isomorphism between $K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$ and the Grothendieck group of a relative extriangulated structure $\mathscr{C}_{R}^{\mathscr{X}}$ on $\mathscr{C}$ when $\mathscr{X}$ is $n$-cluster tilting. In addition, we generalize and enhance some results of Fedele. Our perspective allows us to remove certain restrictions and simplify some arguments.
  Third, as another application of our Extriangulated Resolution Theorem, we show that if $\mathscr{X}$ is $n$-cluster tilting in an abelian category, then the index introduced by Reid gives an isomorphism $K_0(\mathscr{C}_R^{\mathscr{X}}) \cong K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$.</description>
