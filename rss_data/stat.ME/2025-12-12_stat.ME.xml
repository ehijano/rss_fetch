      <title>A Primer on Bayesian Parameter Estimation and Model Selection for Battery Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based battery modelling has emerged to accelerate battery materials discovery and performance assessment. Its success, however, is still hindered by difficulties in aligning models to experimental data. Bayesian approaches are a valuable tool to overcome these challenges, since they enable prior assumptions and observations to be combined in a principled manner that improves numerical conditioning. Here we introduce two new algorithms to the battery community, SOBER and BASQ, that greatly speed up Bayesian inference for parameterisation and model comparison. We showcase how Bayesian model selection allows us to tackle data observability, model identifiability, and data-informed model development together. We propose this approach for the search for battery models of novel materials.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Partial Adherence for Estimation of Dynamic Treatment Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) provide a systematic framework for optimizing sequential decision-making in chronic disease management, where therapies must adapt to patients' evolving clinical profiles. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) is a cornerstone methodology for estimating regime values from observational data due to its intuitive formulation and established theoretical properties, yet standard IPW estimators face significant limitations, including variance instability and data inefficiency. A fundamental but underexplored source of inefficiency lies in the strict binary adherence criterion that fails to account for partial adherence, thereby discarding substantial data from individuals with even minimal deviations from the target regime. We propose two novel methodologies that relax the strict inclusion rule through flexible compatibility mechanisms. Both methods provide computationally tractable alternatives that can be easily integrated into existing IPW workflows, offering more efficient approaches to DTR estimation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that both estimators preserve consistency while achieving superior finite-sample efficiency compared to standard IPW, and comprehensive simulation studies confirm improved stability. We illustrate the practical utility of our methods through an application to HIV treatment data from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 175 (ACTG175).</description>

      <title>Semiparametric rank-based regression models as robust alternatives to parametric mean-based counterparts for censored responses under detection-limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection limits are common in biomedical and environmental studies, where key covariates or outcomes are censored below an assay-specific threshold. Standard approaches such as complete-case analysis, single-value substitution, and parametric Tobit-type models are either inefficient or sensitive to distributional misspecification.
  We study semiparametric rank-based regression models as robust alternatives to parametric mean-based counterparts for censored responses under detection limits. Our focus is on accelerated failure time (AFT) type formulations, where rank-based estimating equations yield consistent slope estimates without specifying the error distribution. We develop a unifying simulation framework that generates left- and right-censored data under several data-generating mechanisms, including normal, Weibull, and log-normal error structures, with detection limits or administrative censoring calibrated to target censoring rates between 10\% and 60\%.
  Across scenarios, we compare semiparametric AFT estimators with parametric Weibull AFT, Tobit, and Cox proportional hazards models in terms of bias, empirical variability, and relative efficiency. Numerical results show that parametric models perform well only under correct specification, whereas rank-based semiparametric AFT estimators maintain near-unbiased covariate effects and stable precision even under heavy censoring and distributional misspecification. These findings support semiparametric rank-based regression as a practical default for censored regression with detection limits when the error distribution is uncertain.

      <title>Time-Averaged Drift Approximations are Inconsistent for Inference in Drift Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drift diffusion models (DDMs) have found widespread use in computational neuroscience and other fields. They model evidence accumulation in simple decision tasks as a stochastic process drifting towards a decision barrier. In models where the drift rate is both time-varying within a trial and variable across trials, the high computational cost for accurate likelihood evaluation has led to the common use of a computationally convenient surrogate for parameter inference, the time-averaged drift approximation (TADA). In each trial, the TADA assumes that the time-varying drift rate can be replaced by its temporal average throughout the trial. This approach enables fast parameter inference using analytical likelihood formulas for DDMs with constant drift. In this work, we show that such an estimator is inconsistent: it does not converge to the true drift, posing a risk of biasing scientific conclusions drawn from parameter estimates produced by TADA and similar surrogates. We provide an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a Brownian motion with piecewise constant drift hitting a one-sided upper boundary. Furthermore, we conduct numerical examples with an attentional DDM (aDDM) to show that the use of TADA systematically misestimates the effect of attention in decision making.</description>

      <title>Peace Sells, But Whose Songs Connect? Bayesian Multilayer Network Analysis of the Big 4 of Thrash Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian framework for multilayer song similarity networks and apply it to the complete studio discographies of the "Big 4" of thrash metal (Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax). Starting from raw audio, we construct four feature-specific layers (loudness, brightness, tonality, rhythm), augment them with song exogenous information, and represent each layer as a k-nearest neighbor graph. We then fit a family of hierarchical probit models with global and layer-specific baselines, node- and layer-specific sociability effects, dyadic covariates, and alternative forms of latent structure (bilinear, distance-based, and stochastic block communities), comparing increasingly flexible specifications using posterior predictive checks, discrimination and calibration metrics (AUC, Brier score, log-loss), and information criteria (DIC, WAIC). Across all bands, the richest stochastic block specification attains the best predictive performance and posterior predictive fit, while revealing sparse but structured connectivity, interpretable covariate effects (notably album membership and temporal proximity), and latent communities and hubs that cut across albums and eras. Taken together, these results illustrate how Bayesian multilayer network models can help organize high-dimensional audio and text features into coherent, musically meaningful patterns.</description>

      <title>Long memory network time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many scientific areas, from computer science to the environmental sciences and finance, give rise to multivariate time series which exhibit long memory, or loosely put, a slow decay in their autocorrelation structure. Efficient modelling and estimation in such settings is key for a number of analysis tasks, such as accurate prediction. However, traditional approaches for modelling such data, for example long memory vector autoregressive processes, are challenging even in modest dimensions, as the number of parameters grows quadratically with the number of modelled variables. Additionally, in many practical data settings, the observed series is accompanied by a (possibly inferred) network that provides information about the presence or absence of between-component associations via the graph edge topology. This article proposes two new models for capturing the dynamics of long memory time series where a network is accounted for. Our approach not only facilitates the analysis of graph-structured long memory time series, but also improves computational efficiency over traditional multivariate long memory models by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional parameter space by adapting likelihood-based estimation algorithms to the network setting. Simulation studies show that our proposed estimation is more stable than traditional models, and is able to tackle data scenarios where current models fail due to computational challenges. While widely applicable, here we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed models on datasets arising in environmental science and finance.</description>

      <title>Learning Time-Varying Correlation Networks with FDR Control via Time-Varying P-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic framework for controlling false discovery rate in learning time-varying correlation networks from high-dimensional, non-linear, non-Gaussian and non-stationary time series with an increasing number of potential abrupt change points in means. We propose a bootstrap-assisted approach to derive dependent and time-varying P-values from a robust estimate of time-varying correlation functions, which are not sensitive to change points. Our procedure is based on a new high-dimensional Gaussian approximation result for the uniform approximation of P-values across time and different coordinates. Moreover, we establish theoretically guaranteed Benjamini--Hochberg and Benjamini--Yekutieli procedures for the dependent and time-varying P-values, which can achieve uniform false discovery rate control. The proposed methods are supported by rigorous mathematical proofs and simulation studies. We also illustrate the real-world application of our framework using both brain electroencephalogram and financial time series data.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Two-Sample Mean Test for High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two-sample Bayesian mean test based on the Bayes factor with non-informative priors, specifically designed for scenarios where $p$ grows with $n$ with a linear rate $p/n \to c_1 \in (0, \infty)$. We establish the asymptotic normality of the test statistic and the asymptotic power. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed test performs competitively, particularly when the diagonal elements have heterogeneous variances and for small sample sizes. Furthermore, our test remains robust under distribution misspecification. The proposed method not only effectively detects both sparse and non-sparse differences in mean vectors but also maintains a well-controlled type I error rate, even in small-sample scenarios. We also demonstrate the performance of our proposed test using the \texttt{SRBCTs} dataset.</description>

      <title>Lasso-Ridge Refitting: A Two-Stage Estimator for High-Dimensional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) is a popular method for high-dimensional statistics. However, it is known that the Lasso often has estimation bias and prediction error. To address such disadvantages, many alternatives and refitting strategies have been proposed and studied. This work introduces a novel Lasso--Ridge method. Our analysis indicates that the proposed estimator achieves improved prediction performance in a range of settings, including cases where the Lasso is tuned at its theoretical optimal rate \(\sqrt{\log(p)/n}\). Moreover, the proposed method retains several key advantages of the Lasso, such as prediction consistency and reliable variable selection under mild conditions. Through extensive simulations, we further demonstrate that our estimator outperforms the Lasso in both prediction and estimation accuracy, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for high-dimensional linear regression.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the apparent discrepancy between the frequentist and Bayesian interpretation of an adaptive design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally appreciated that a frequentist analysis of a group sequential trial must in order to avoid inflating type I error account for the fact that one or more interim analyses were performed. It is also to a lesser extent realised that it may be necessary to account for the ensuing estimation bias. A group sequential design is an instance of adaptive clinical trials where a study may change its design dynamically as a reaction to the observed data. There is a widespread perception that one may circumvent the statistical issues associated with the analysis of an adaptive clinical trial by performing the analysis under a Bayesian paradigm. The root of the argument is that the Bayesian posterior is perceived as unaltered by the data-driven adaptations. We examine this claim by analysing a simple trial with a single interim analysis. We approach the interpretation of the trial data under both a frequentist and Bayesian paradigm with a focus on estimation. The conventional result is that the interim analysis impacts the estimation procedure under the frequentist paradigm, but not under the Bayesian paradigm, which may be seen as expressing a "paradox" between the two paradigms. We argue that this result however relies heavily on what one would define as the universe of relevant trials defined by first samples of the parameters from a prior distribution and then the data from a sampling model given the parameters. In particular, in this set of trials, whether a connection exists between the parameter of interest and design parameters. We show how an alternative interpretation of the trial yields a Bayesian posterior mean that corrects for the interim analysis with a term that closely resembles the frequentist conditional bias. We conclude that the role of auxiliary trial parameters needs to be carefully considered when constructing a prior in an adaptive design.</description>

      <title>Dynamic sparse graphs with overlapping communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic community detection in networks addresses the challenge of tracking how groups of interconnected nodes evolve, merge, and dissolve within time-evolving networks. Here, we propose a novel statistical framework for sparse networks with power-law degree distribution and dynamic overlapping community structure. Using a Bayesian Nonparametric framework, we build on the idea to represent the graph as an exchangeable point process on the plane. We base the model construction on vectors of completely random measures and a latent Markov process for the time-evolving node affiliations. This construction provides a flexible and interpretable approach to model dynamic communities, naturally generalizing existing overlapping block models to the sparse and scale-free regimes. We provide the asymptotic properties of the model concerning sparsity and power-law behavior and propose inference through an approximate procedure which we validate empirically. We show how the model can uncover interpretable community trajectories in a real-world network.</description>

      <title>Identifiable factor analysis for mixed continuous and binary variables based on the Gaussian-Grassmann distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a factor analysis for mixed continuous and binary observed variables. To this end, we utilized a recently developed multivariate probability distribution for mixed-type random variables, the Gaussian-Grassmann distribution. In the proposed factor analysis, marginalization over latent variables can be performed analytically, yielding an analytical expression for the distribution of the observed variables. This analytical tractability allows model parameters to be estimated using standard gradient-based optimization techniques. We also address improper solutions associated with maximum likelihood factor analysis. We propose a prescription to avoid improper solutions by imposing a constraint that row vectors of the factor loading matrix have the same norm for all features. Then, we prove that the proposed factor analysis is identifiable under the norm constraint. We demonstrate the validity of this norm constraint prescription and numerically verified the model's identifiability using both real and synthetic datasets. We also compare the proposed model with quantification method and found that the proposed model achieves better reproducibility of correlations than the quantification method.</description>

      <title>Measures and Models of Non-Monotonic Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A margin-free measure of bivariate association generalizing Spearman's rho to the case of non-monotonic dependence is defined in terms of two square integrable functions on the unit interval. Properties of generalized Spearman correlation are investigated when the functions are piecewise continuous and strictly monotonic, with particular focus on the special cases where the functions are drawn from orthonormal bases defined by Legendre polynomials and cosine functions. For continuous random variables, generalized Spearman correlation is treated as a copula-based measure and shown to depend on a pair of uniform-distribution-preserving (udp) transformations determined by the underlying functions. Bounds for generalized Spearman correlation are derived and a novel technique referred to as stochastic inversion of udp transformations is used to construct singular copulas that attain the bounds and parametric copulas with densities that interpolate between the bounds and model different degrees of non-monotonic dependence. Sample analogues of generalized Spearman correlation are proposed and their asymptotic and small-sample properties are investigated. Potential applications of the theory are demonstrated including: exploratory analyses of the dependence structures of datasets and their symmetries; elicitation of functions maximizing generalized Spearman correlation via expansions in orthonormal basis functions; and construction of tractable probability densities to model a wide variety of non-monotonic dependencies.</description>

      <title>Inference for Batched Adaptive Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advantages of adaptive experiments have led to their rapid adoption in economics, other fields, as well as among practitioners. However, adaptive experiments pose challenges for causal inference. This note suggests a BOLS (batched ordinary least squares) test statistic for inference of treatment effects in adaptive experiments. The statistic provides a precision-equalizing aggregation of per-period treatment-control differences under heteroskedasticity. The combined test statistic is a normalized average of heteroskedastic per-period z-statistics and can be used to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals. We provide simulation results comparing rejection rates in the typical case with few treatment periods and few (or many) observations per batch.</description>

      <title>Topology Identification and Inference over Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology identification and inference of processes evolving over graphs arise in timely applications involving brain, transportation, financial, power, as well as social and information networks. This chapter provides an overview of graph topology identification and statistical inference methods for multidimensional relational data. Approaches for undirected links connecting graph nodes are outlined, going all the way from correlation metrics to covariance selection, and revealing ties with smooth signal priors. To account for directional (possibly causal) relations among nodal variables and address the limitations of linear time-invariant models in handling dynamic as well as nonlinear dependencies, a principled framework is surveyed to capture these complexities through judiciously selected kernels from a prescribed dictionary. Generalizations are also described via structural equations and vector autoregressions that can exploit attributes such as low rank, sparsity, acyclicity, and smoothness to model dynamic processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. It is argued that this approach supports both batch and online learning algorithms with convergence rate guarantees, is amenable to tensor (that is, multi-way array) formulations as well as decompositions that are well-suited for multidimensional network data, and can seamlessly leverage high-order statistical information.</description>

      <title>Alpha Power Harris-G Family of Distributions: Properties and Application to Burr XII Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new family of probability distributions, termed the alpha power Harris-generalized (APHG) family. The generator arises by incorporating two shape parameters from the Harris-G framework into the alpha power transformation, resulting in a more flexible class for modelling survival and reliability data. A special member of this family, obtained using the two-parameter Burr XII distribution as the baseline, is developed and examined in detail. Several analytical properties of the proposed alpha power Harris Burr XII (APHBXII) model are derived, which include closed-form expressions for its moments, mean and median deviations, Bonferroni and Lorenz curves, order statistics, and Renyi and Tsallis entropies. Parameter estimation is performed via maximum likelihood, and a Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to assess the finite-sample performance of the estimators. In addition, three real lifetime datasets are analyzed to evaluate the empirical performance of the APHBXII distribution relative to four competing models. The results show that the five-parameter APHBXII model provides superior fit across all datasets, as supported by model-selection criteria and goodness-of-fit statistics.</description>

      <title>Maximum Risk Minimization with Random Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a regression setting where observations are collected in different environments modeled by different data distributions. The field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization aims to design methods that generalize better to test environments whose distributions differ from those observed during training. One line of such works has proposed to minimize the maximum risk across environments, a principle that we refer to as MaxRM (Maximum Risk Minimization). In this work, we introduce variants of random forests based on the principle of MaxRM. We provide computationally efficient algorithms and prove statistical consistency for our primary method. Our proposed method can be used with each of the following three risks: the mean squared error, the negative reward (which relates to the explained variance), and the regret (which quantifies the excess risk relative to the best predictor). For MaxRM with regret as the risk, we prove a novel out-of-sample guarantee over unseen test distributions. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods on both simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping not under the null?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a bootstrap testing framework for a general class of hypothesis tests, which allows resampling under the null hypothesis as well as other forms of bootstrapping. We identify combinations of resampling schemes and bootstrap statistics for which the resulting tests are asymptotically exact and consistent against fixed alternatives. We show that in these cases the limiting local power functions are the same for the different resampling schemes. We also show that certain naive bootstrap schemes do not work. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply the framework to several examples: independence tests, tests on the coefficients in linear regression models, goodness-of-fit tests for general parametric models and for semi-parametric copula models. Simulation results confirm the asymptotic results and suggest that in smaller samples non-traditional bootstrap schemes may have advantages. This bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework is implemented in the R package BootstrapTests.</description>

      <title>Marginal Interventional Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional causal estimands, such as the average treatment effect (ATE), capture how the mean outcome in a population or subpopulation would change if all units were assigned to treatment versus control. Real-world policy changes, however, are often incremental, changing treatment status for only a small segment of the population -- those at or near the "margin of participation." To formalize this idea, two parallel literatures in economics and in statistics and epidemiology have developed what we call interventional effects. In this article, we unify these perspectives by defining the interventional effect (IE) as the per capita effect of a treatment intervention on an outcome of interest, and the marginal interventional effect (MIE) as its limit when the intervention size approaches zero. The IE and MIE can be viewed as unconditional counterparts of the policy-relevant treatment effect (PRTE) and marginal PRTE (MPRTE) from the economics literature. Unlike the PRTE and MPRTE, however, the IE and MIE are defined without reliance on a latent index model and can be identified either under unconfoundedness or with instrumental variables. For both scenarios, we show that MIEs are typically identified without the strong positivity assumption required of the ATE, highlight several "stylized interventions" that may be particularly relevant for policy analysis, discuss several parametric and semiparametric estimation strategies, and illustrate the proposed methods with an empirical example.</description>

      <title>Augmented match weighted estimators for average treatment effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Propensity score matching (PSM) and augmented inverse propensity weighting (AIPW) are widely used in observational studies to estimate causal effects. The two approaches present complementary features. The AIPW estimator is doubly robust and locally efficient but can be unstable when the propensity scores are close to zero or one due to weighting by the inverse of the propensity score. On the other hand, PSM circumvents the instability of propensity score weighting but it hinges on the correctness of the propensity score model and cannot attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Besides, the fixed number of matches, K, renders PSM nonsmooth and thus invalidates standard nonparametric bootstrap inference.
  This article presents novel augmented match weighted (AMW) estimators that combine the advantages of matching and weighting estimators. AMW adheres to the form of AIPW for its double robustness and local efficiency but it mitigates the instability due to weighting. We replace inverse propensity weights with matching weights resulting from PSM with unfixed K. Meanwhile, we propose a new cross-validation procedure to select K that minimizes the mean squared error anchored around an unbiased estimator of the causal estimand. Besides, we derive the limiting distribution for the AMW estimators showing that they enjoy the double robustness property and can achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound if both nuisance models are correct. As a byproduct of unfixed K which smooths the AMW estimators, nonparametric bootstrap can be adopted for variance estimation and inference. Furthermore, simulation studies and real data applications support that the AMW estimators are stable with extreme propensity scores and their variances can be obtained by naive bootstrap.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework for Multivariate Differential Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential analysis is a routine procedure in the statistical analysis toolbox across many applied fields, including quantitative proteomics, the main illustration of the present paper. The state-of-the-art limma approach uses a hierarchical formulation with moderated-variance estimators for each analyte directly injected into the t-statistic. While standard hypothesis testing strategies are recognised for their low computational cost, allowing for quick extraction of the most differential among thousands of elements, they generally overlook key aspects such as handling missing values, inter-element correlations, and uncertainty quantification. The present paper proposes a fully Bayesian framework for differential analysis, leveraging a conjugate hierarchical formulation for both the mean and the variance. Inference is performed by computing the posterior distribution of compared experimental conditions and sampling from the distribution of differences. This approach provides well-calibrated uncertainty quantification at a similar computational cost as hypothesis testing by leveraging closed-form equations. Furthermore, a natural extension enables multivariate differential analysis that accounts for possible inter-element correlations. We also demonstrate that, in this Bayesian treatment, missing data should generally be ignored in univariate settings, and further derive a tailored approximation that handles multiple imputation for the multivariate setting. We argue that probabilistic statements in terms of effect size and associated uncertainty are better suited to practical decision-making. Therefore, we finally propose simple and intuitive inference criteria, such as the overlap coefficient, which express group similarity as a probability rather than traditional, and often misleading, p-values.</description>

Abstract: The original generalized network autoregressive models are poor for modelling count data as they are based on the additive and constant noise assumptions, which is usually inappropriate for count data. We introduce two new models (GNARI and NGNAR) for count network time series by adapting and extending existing count-valued time series models. We present results on the statistical and asymptotic properties of our new models and their estimates obtained by conditional least squares and maximum likelihood. We conduct two simulation studies that verify successful parameter estimation for both models and conduct a further study that shows, for negative network parameters, that our NGNAR model outperforms existing models and our other GNARI model in terms of predictive performance. We model a network time series constructed from COVID-positive counts for counties in New York State during 2020-22 and show that our new models perform considerably better than existing methods for this problem.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Level Set Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classically, Bayesian clustering interprets each component of a mixture model as a cluster. The inferred clustering posterior is highly sensitive to any inaccuracies in the kernel within each component. As this kernel is made more flexible, problems arise in identifying the underlying clusters in the data. To address this pitfall, this article proposes a fundamentally different approach to Bayesian clustering that decouples the problems of clustering and flexible modeling of the data density $f$. Starting with an arbitrary Bayesian model for $f$ and a loss function for defining clusters based on $f$, we develop a Bayesian decision-theoretic framework for density-based clustering. Within this framework, we develop a Bayesian level set clustering method to cluster data into connected components of a level set of $f$. We provide theoretical support, including clustering consistency, and highlight performance in a variety of simulated examples. An application to astronomical data illustrates improvements over the popular DBSCAN algorithm in terms of accuracy, insensitivity to tuning parameters, and providing uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>On Relative Cumulative Residual Information Measure and Its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a relative cumulative residual information measure (RCRI) that aims to quantify the divergence between two survival functions. The dynamic relative cumulative residual information (DRCRI) measure is also introduced. We establish some characterization results under the proportional hazards model assumption. Additionally, we obtained the non-parametric estimators of RCRI and DRCRI measures based on the kernel density type estimator for the survival function. The effectiveness of the estimators are assessed through an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study. We consider data from the third Gaia data release (Gaia DR3) to demonstrate the use of the proposed measure. For this study, we have collected epoch photometry data for the objects Gaia DR3 4111834567779557376 and Gaia DR3 5090605830056251776. The RCRI-based image analysis is conducted using Chest X-ray data from the publicly available dataset.</description>

      <title>The causal effects of modified treatment policies under network interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modified treatment policies are a widely applicable class of interventions useful for studying the causal effects of continuous exposures. Approaches to evaluating their causal effects assume no interference, meaning that such effects cannot be learned from data in settings where the exposure of one unit affects the outcomes of others, as is common in spatial or network data. We introduce a new class of intervention, induced modified treatment policies, which we show identify such causal effects in the presence of network interference. Building on recent developments for causal inference in networks, we provide flexible, semi-parametric efficient estimators of the statistical estimand. Numerical experiments demonstrate that an induced modified treatment policy can eliminate the causal, or identification, bias that results from network interference. We use the methodology developed to evaluate the effect of zero-emission vehicle uptake on air pollution in California, strengthening prior evidence.</description>

Abstract: Not many tests exist for testing the equality for two or more multivariate distributions with compositional data, perhaps due to their constrained sample space. At the moment, there is only one test suggested that relies upon random projections. We propose a novel test termed {\alpha}-Energy Based Test ({\alpha}-EBT) to compare the multivariate distributions of two (or more) compositional data sets. Similar to the aforementioned test, the new test makes no parametric assumptions about the data and, based on simulation studies it exhibits higher power levels.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry plays a central role in the sciences, machine learning, and statistics. While statistical tests for the presence of distributional invariance with respect to groups have a long history, tests for conditional symmetry in the form of equivariance or conditional invariance are absent from the literature. This work initiates the study of nonparametric randomization tests for symmetry (invariance or equivariance) of a conditional distribution under the action of a specified locally compact group. We develop a general framework for randomization tests with finite-sample Type I error control and, using kernel methods, implement tests with finite-sample power lower bounds. We also describe and implement approximate versions of the tests, which are asymptotically consistent. We study their properties empirically using synthetic examples and applications to testing for symmetry in two problems from high-energy particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard A/B testing approaches are mostly based on t-test in large scale industry applications. These standard approaches however suffers from low statistical power in business settings, due to nature of small sample-size or non-Gaussian distribution or return-on-investment (ROI) consideration. In this paper, we (i) show the statistical efficiency of using estimating equation and U statistics, which can address these issues separately; and (ii) propose a novel doubly robust generalized U that allows flexible definition of treatment effect, and can handles small samples, distribution robustness, ROI and confounding consideration in one framework. We provide theoretical results on asymptotics and efficiency bounds, together with insights on the efficiency gain from theoretical analysis. We further conduct comprehensive simulation studies, apply the methods to multiple real A/B tests at a large SaaS company, and share results and learnings that are broadly useful.</description>

      <title>Optimal designs for identifying effective doses in drug combination studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the optimal design problem for identifying effective dose combinations within drug combination studies where the effect of the combination of two drugs is investigated. Drug combination studies are becoming increasingly important as they investigate potential interaction effects rather than the individual impacts of the drugs. In this situation, identifying effective dose combinations that yield a prespecified effect is of special interest. If nonlinear surface models are used to describe the dose combination-response relationship, these effective dose combinations result in specific contour lines of the fitted response model.
  We propose a novel design criterion that targets the precise estimation of these effective dose combinations. In particular, an optimal design minimizes the width of the confidence band of the contour lines of interest. Optimal design theory is developed for this problem, including equivalence theorems and efficiency bounds. The performance of the optimal design is illustrated in different examples modeling dose combination data by various nonlinear surface models. It is demonstrated that the proposed optimal design for identifying effective dose combinations yields a more precise estimation of the effective dose combinations than ray or factorial designs, which are commonly used in practice. This particularly holds true for a case study motivated by data from an oncological dose combination study.</description>

      <title>Bias in estimating Theil, Atkinson, and dispersion indices for gamma mixture populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the finite-sample bias of estimators for the Theil and Atkinson indices, as well as for the variance-to-mean ratio (VMR), under the assumption that the population follows a finite mixture of gamma distributions with a common rate parameter. Using Mosimann's proportion-sum independence theorem and the structural relationship between the gamma and Dirichlet distributions, these estimators were rewritten as functions of Dirichlet vectors, which enabled the derivation of closed-form analytical expressions for their expected values. A Monte Carlo simulation study evaluates the performance of both the traditional and bias-corrected estimators across a range of mixture scenarios and sample sizes, revealing systematic bias induced by population heterogeneity and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed corrections, particularly in small and moderate samples. An empirical application to global per capita GDP data further illustrates the practical relevance of the methodology and confirms the suitability of gamma mixtures for representing structural economic heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Efficient Multiple Imputation for Case-Cohort Studies via Influence Function-Based Supersampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-phase sampling designs have been widely adopted in epidemiological studies to reduce costs when measuring certain biomarkers is prohibitively expensive. Under these designs, investigators commonly relate survival outcomes to risk factors using the Cox proportional hazards model. To fully utilize covariates collected in phase 1, multiple imputation (MI) methods have been developed to impute missing covariates for individuals not included in the phase 2 sample. However, MI becomes computationally intensive in large-scale cohorts, particularly when rejection sampling is employed to mitigate bias arising from nonlinear or interaction terms in the analysis model. To address this issue, Borgan et al. (2023) proposed a random supersampling (RSS) approach that randomly selects a subset of cohort members for imputation, albeit at the cost of reduced efficiency. In this study, we propose an influence function-based supersampling (ISS) method with weight calibration. The method achieves efficiency comparable to imputing the entire cohort, even with a small supersample, while substantially reducing computational burden. We further demonstrate that the proposed method is especially advantageous when estimating hazard ratios for high-dimensional expensive biomarkers. Extensive simulation studies are conducted, and a real data application is provided using the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons (NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study.</description>

      <title>Location--Scale Calibration for Generalized Posterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General Bayesian updating replaces the likelihood with a loss scaled by a learning rate, but posterior uncertainty can depend sharply on that scale. We propose a simple post-processing that aligns generalized posterior draws with their asymptotic target, yielding uncertainty quantification that is invariant to the learning rate. We prove total-variation convergence for generalized posteriors with an effective sample size, allowing sample-size-dependent priors, non-i.i.d. observations, and convex penalties under model misspecification. Within this framework, we justify and extend the open-faced sandwich adjustment (Shaby, 2014), provide general theoretical guarantees for its use within generalized Bayes, and extend it from covariance rescaling to a location--scale calibration whose draws converge in total variation to the target for any learning rate. In our empirical illustration, calibrated draws maintain stable coverage, interval width, and bias over orders of magnitude in the learning rate and closely track frequentist benchmarks, whereas uncalibrated posteriors vary markedly.</description>

      <title>Univariate-Guided Sparse Regression for Biobank-Scale High-Dimensional Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scalable framework for computing polygenic risk scores (PRS) in high-dimensional genomic settings using the recently introduced Univariate-Guided Sparse Regression (uniLasso). UniLasso is a two-stage penalized regression procedure that leverages univariate coefficients and magnitudes to stabilize feature selection and enhance interpretability. Building on its theoretical and empirical advantages, we adapt uniLasso for application to the UK Biobank, a population-based repository comprising over one million genetic variants measured on hundreds of thousands of individuals from the United Kingdom. We further extend the framework to incorporate external summary statistics to increase predictive accuracy. Our results demonstrate that uniLasso attains predictive performance comparable to standard Lasso while selecting substantially fewer variants, yielding sparser and more interpretable models. Moreover, it exhibits superior performance in estimating PRS relative to its competitors, such as PRS-CS. Integrating external scores further improves prediction while maintaining sparsity.</description>

      <title>Latency-Response Theory Model: Evaluating Large Language Models via Response Accuracy and Chain-of-Thought Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates valid evaluation methods to guide downstream applications and actionable future improvements. The Item Response Theory (IRT) has recently emerged as a promising framework for evaluating LLMs via their response accuracy. Beyond simple response accuracy, LLMs' chain of thought (CoT) lengths serve as a vital indicator of their reasoning ability. To leverage the CoT length information to assist the evaluation of LLMs, we propose Latency-Response Theory (LaRT) to jointly model the response accuracy and CoT length by introducing the latent ability, latent speed, and a key correlation parameter between them. We derive an efficient estimation algorithm and establish rigorous identifiability results for the population parameters to ensure the statistical validity of estimation. Theoretical asymptotic analyses and simulation studies demonstrate LaRT's advantages over IRT in terms of higher estimation accuracy and shorter confidence intervals for latent traits. A key finding is that the asymptotic estimation precision of the latent ability under LaRT exceeds that of IRT whenever the latent ability and latent speed are correlated. We collect real responses from diverse LLMs on popular benchmark datasets. The application of LaRT reveals a strong negative correlation between the latent ability and latent speed in all benchmarks, with stronger correlation for more difficult benchmarks. This finding supports the intuition that higher reasoning ability correlates with slower speed and longer response latency. LaRT yields different LLM rankings than IRT and outperforms IRT across multiple key evaluation metrics including predictive power, item efficiency, ranking validity, and LLM evaluation efficiency.

      <title>Bayesian Matrix Factor Models for Demographic Analysis Across Age and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing demographic data collected across multiple populations, time periods, and age groups is challenging due to the interplay of high dimensionality, demographic heterogeneity among groups, and stochastic variability within smaller groups. This paper proposes a Bayesian matrix factor model to address these challenges. By factorizing count data matrices as the product of low-dimensional latent age and time factors, the model achieves a parsimonious representation that mitigates overfitting and remains computationally feasible even when hundreds of populations are involved. Informative priors enforce smoothness in the age factors and allow for the dynamic evolution of the time factors. A straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for posterior inference. Applying the model to Austrian district-level migration data from 2002 to 2023 demonstrates its ability to accurately reconstruct complex demographic processes using only a fraction of the parameters required by conventional demographic factor models. A forecasting exercise shows that the proposed model consistently outperforms standard benchmarks. Beyond statistical demography, the framework holds promise for a wide range of applications involving noisy, heterogeneous, and high-dimensional non-Gaussian matrix-valued data.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy scientific inference with generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) excels at producing complex data structures (text, images, videos) by learning patterns from training examples. Across scientific disciplines, researchers are now applying generative models to "inverse problems" to directly predict hidden parameters from observed data along with measures of uncertainty. While these predictive or posterior-based methods can handle intractable likelihoods and large-scale studies, they can also produce biased or overconfident conclusions even without model misspecifications. We present a solution with Frequentist-Bayes (FreB), a mathematically rigorous protocol that reshapes AI-generated posterior probability distributions into (locally valid) confidence regions that consistently include true parameters with the expected probability, while achieving minimum size when training and target data align. We demonstrate FreB's effectiveness by tackling diverse case studies in the physical sciences: identifying unknown sources under dataset shift, reconciling competing theoretical models, and mitigating selection bias and systematics in observational studies. By providing validity guarantees with interpretable diagnostics, FreB enables trustworthy scientific inference across fields where direct likelihood evaluation remains impossible or prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Selection with an Application to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological parameter inference and model selection from a Bayesian perspective. Type Ia supernova data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SN5YR) are used to test the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and CPL cosmological models. Posterior inference is performed via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) implemented in NumPyro and analyzed with ArviZ in Python. Bayesian model comparison is conducted through Bayes factors computed using the bridgesampling library in R. The results indicate that all three models demonstrate similar predictive performance, but $w$CDM shows stronger evidence relative to $\Lambda$CDM and CPL. We conclude that, under the assumptions and data used in this study, $w$CDM provides a better description of cosmological expansion.</description>
