      <title>Response of Elliptical Scatterer Due to Perfect Magnetic Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects on the bistatic echo width of an elliptical cylinder due to a perfect magnetic material are reported in this article. The configuration is analyzed using the separation of variables method and Mathieu functions. In this approach, the structural geometry is illuminated by an electromagnetic field. Radial and angular Mathieu functions have been used in the formulation. Notably, the maxima of the scattered elliptic transfer electric mode ($\theta = 180^{\circ}$) are much higher than those of the scattered transfer magnetic mode, comparable to terms $\theta = 120^{\circ}$ and $\theta = 240^{\circ}$, respectively. It can be observed that an increase in the in-plane radial component leads to the linearity principle for the transfer electric mode, while non-linear behavior is investigated for the elliptic transfer magnetic mode. Therefore, the unidirectional bistatic echo width is subject to non-directional behavior. These analogous results may have applications in the fields of optics, meteorology, acoustics, radio astronomy, collision physics, and other disciplines where wave scattering phenomena play a crucial role. Furthermore, the findings of this study contribute to the fundamental understanding of electromagnetic interactions with complex geometries and materials</description>

      <title>Kirigami Film Reflector for Deployable Space Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a low-pretension reflective kirigami film as a material for the reflective surfaces of large deployable space reflector antennas with an operating frequency around 10 GHz. The kirigami cut pattern is based on the well-known rotating squares pattern but is augmented with diagonal cuts to enhance stretchability and allow control over the effective Poisson's ratio. Using finite element simulations, we analyzed how the geometric parameters of this pattern affected the reflectance of the film and the pretension required to resist thermal deformations. Tensile testing of selected designs, which are approximately half the weight of traditional metallic meshes, demonstrated a substantial reduction in the needed pretension to ~0.5 N/m and as low as ~0.1 N/m. Such low pretension represents an order-of-magnitude improvement over traditional metallic mesh reflectors and could enable the use of lighter antenna trusses. Free-space reflectance measurements also show that these perforated films can maintain power reflectance exceeding 90% at 10 GHz under the strains expected in the deployed configuration.</description>

      <title>The tube transducer as a novel source for power ultrasound: A case study in delamination of graphite coating from lithium-ion battery anode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing high throughput applications of sonochemistry and sonoprocessing is an outstanding ultrasonic engineering challenge that continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. Conventional mass-produced Langevin-based technologies, such as the sonotrode or cleaning bath transducers, are not particularly well suited to treating large liquid volumes or flow-based systems, with a compromise between cavitation intensity and distribution through liquid bulk typically required. We report on the development of a tube transducer from a single element radially poled tubular piezoceramic, excited to generate an axially focused field. High-speed imaging and sonochemiluminescence are used to characterise the cavitation generated, which is also compared to the well-known activity at the tip of a sonotrode. Tube transducer and sonotrode sonications are then assessed for the material recycling application of graphite coating delamination from lithium-ion battery anode, both for intact and flaked anode sheets. The findings show that the tube transducer generates cavitation at sonotrode-like intensities or higher but distributed throughout the bore of the tube, with peak activity at the central axis. Prospects for developing tube transducer technology for high throughput flow-based applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Zero- to low-field J-spectroscopy with a diamond magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of zero- to ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) signals at frequencies of a few hertz with a diamond-based magnetic sensor. The sensing diamond is a truncated pyramid with 0.18 mm height and a 0.5 mm x 0.5mm base. The minimum stand-off distance is &lt; 1 mm, and the sensor sensitivity is 13 pT/(Hz)^(1/2) at frequencies f above 5 Hz with 1/f-like behavior at lower frequencies. NMR signals were generated via signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) parahydrogen-based hyperpolarization resulting in zero-field signals at 1.7 Hz and 3.4 Hz corresponding to the expected hetero-nuclear J-coupling pattern of acetonitrile. This work demonstrates a magnet-free platform for detecting chemically specific NMR signals at ultra-low frequencies paving the way for portable noninvasive diagnostics in microscopic sample volumes for biomedicine, industrial sensing through metal enclosures, and field-deployable quantum analytical devices.</description>

      <title>Design of a High-Power and High-Efficiency GaN-HEMT VCO Based on an Inverse Class-F Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a high-power and high-efficiency GaN-HEMT voltage-controlled oscillator. The VCO consists of a coupled-line coupler, an inverse class-F amplifier, and a novel frequency-tunable stepped-impedance resonator. Using a harmonic control circuit and a parasitic parameter compensation circuit, the power amplifier operates in the inverse class-F state to achieve high efficiency. The feedback circuit uses a coupled-line coupler instead of the traditional coupling capacitor to control feedback power precisely. The measurement results show that the VCO with an oscillation frequency of 2.41-2.45 GHz achieves a maximum conversion efficiency of 74.5% at 2.44 GHz and an output power of 40.2 dBm. It is a candidate for the microwave source in a wireless power transmission system.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity enhancement and doping-dependent phase diagram of Sm-based oxypnictides by high-pressure growth technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples are synthesized using an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) technique at 4 GPa and are characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. A systematic reduction of lattice parameters and unit-cell volume confirms effective fluorine substitution at oxygen sites, while Raman spectroscopy reveals electron doping and subtle changes in local bonding environments. In the underdoped regime, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude. The upper critical field (Hc2), estimated using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, reaches ~200 T, indicating strong spin paramagnetic effects and multiband superconductivity. Resistive broadening under applied fields follows Arrhenius behavior, with the activation energy showing a power-law field dependence that decreases rapidly at higher fields, consistent with collective vortex pinning. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A-cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. A direct comparison with CSP samples demonstrates that high-pressure synthesis simultaneously enhances both Tc and Jc across the entire fluorine-doping range. These findings establish high-pressure growth as a highly effective approach for optimizing iron-based superconductors and underscore its potential for both fundamental research and future high field applications.</description>

      <title>Mapping vacancy and bonding electron distributions around aluminium nanovoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All materials have defects and many contain nanostructures, both of which disrupt chemical bonding - the basis of materials properties. No experimental measurements of bonding electron distributions associated with defects and nanostructures have ever been possible. We present a method enabling such measurements and interrogate nanovoids surrounded by vacancies - the most fundamental of nanostructures and defects - in aluminium. We measure the volume of a vacancy with 3% uncertainty and map vacancy concentrations surrounding nanovoids with nanometre resolution in three dimensions where previously only two-dimensional mapping was possible. We discover that radiation-damaged voids can "heal". Our bonding measurements are depth-resolved, vacancy-sensitive, and agree with density functional theory. This work opens bonding electron density measurements to inhomogeneous nanostructured multi-phased materials so that the electronic origins of phenomena such as strengthening, weakening, interface functionality, solute diffusion and phase transformations within them may be revealed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a differential geometry based on quantum mechanics. It is related to various transport and optical properties in condensed matter physics. The Zeeman quantum geometry is a generalization of quantum geometry including the spin degrees of freedom. It is related to electromagnetic cross responses. Quantum geometry is generalized to non-Hermitian systems and density matrices. Especially, the latter is quantum information geometry, where the quantum Fisher information naturally arises as quantum metric. We apply these results to the $X$-wave magnets, which include $d$-wave, $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets as well as $p$-wave and $f$-wave magnets. They have universal physics for anomalous Hall conductivity, tunneling magneto-resistance and planar Hall effect. We obtain various analytic formulas based on the two-band Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-based all-optical diffractive convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating energy demands and parallel-processing bottlenecks of electronic neural networks underscore the need for alternative computing paradigms. Optical neural networks, capitalizing on the inherent parallelism and speed of light propagation, present a compelling solution. Nevertheless, physically realizing convolutional neural network (CNN) components all-optically remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a metasurface-based all-optical diffractive convolutional neural network (MAODCNN) for computer vision tasks. This architecture synergistically integrates metasurface-based optical convolutional layers, which perform parallel convolution on the optical field, with cascaded diffractive neural networks acting as all-optical decoders. This co-design facilitates layer-wise feature extraction and optimization directly within the optical domain. Numerical simulations confirm that the fusion of convolutional and diffractive layers markedly enhances classification accuracy, a performance that scales with the number of diffractive layers. The MAODCNN framework establishes a viable foundation for practical all-optical CNNs, paving the way for high-efficiency, low-power optical computing in advanced pattern recognition.</description>

      <title>Prussian Blue and Prussian Blue Analogs as Emerging Memristive Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and related organic materials are promising platforms for next-generation memory and energy-storage technologies due to their redox activity, ionic mobility, and compatibility with low-cost and scalable fabrication. Electrodeposited Prussian Blue (PB) and Prussian White (PW) thin films show robust resistive switching with ON/OFF ratios from one to three orders of magnitude in both bipolar and unipolar modes. Structural and spectroscopic analyses reveal homogeneous films with well-defined grain boundaries and ionic pathways that enable filamentary conduction. Current-voltage measurements, impedance spectroscopy, and quantum transport modeling indicate switching mechanisms governed by ohmic or space-charge-limited conduction, driven by potassium-ion migration and reversible redox processes. PB-based devices also exhibit conductance quantization with discrete steps at integer and half-integer multiples of G0, consistent with ballistic electron transport through atomic-scale channels. Complementary studies on perylene-based liquid crystals and FeHCF on graphene oxide highlight the versatility of PBAs for memory and supercapacitor applications. Together, these results demonstrate the multifunctionality and scalability of PBAs for future ReRAM, neuromorphic computing, multilevel memory, cryptographic hardware, and high-performance energy-storage devices.</description>

      <title>Size-effects on shift-current in layered CuInP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ferroelectrics have recently emerged as a promising avenue for next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Due to the intrinsic absence of inversion symmetry, 2D ferroelectrics exhibit bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), which relies on hot, non-thermalized photo-excited carriers to generate a photo-induced current with enhanced performances thanks to efficient charge separation mechanisms. The absence of a required p-n junction architecture makes these materials particularly attractive for nanoscale energy harvesting. Recent studies have reported enhanced BPVE in nanometer-thick CuInP$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric embedded between two graphene wafers, driven by relatively strong polarization and reduced dimensionality. Short circuit photocurrent density values have been observed to reach up to mA/cm$^2$. In this paper, we demonstrate that the shift-current mechanism alone cannot fully account for these high conductivity values, suggesting that additional mechanisms may play a significant role. Furthermore, our work confirms the existence of a strong size effect, which drastically reduces the shift-conductivity response in the bulk limit, in agreement with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Relating the dynamics of photo de-mixing in mixed bromide-iodide perovskites to ionic and electronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of reversible de-mixing phenomena in mixed-halide perovskites under illumination is one of the most challenging as well as intriguing aspects of this class of materials. On the one hand, it poses critical constraints to the compositional space that allows reliable design of absorbers for perovskite photovoltaics. On the other hand, it holds potential for the development of novel optoionic devices where an ionic response is triggered via optical stimuli. Funda-mental questions about the origin of such photo de-mixing process remain unanswered, both in terms of its mechanism as well as thermodynamic description. Here, we relate in-situ measurements of ionic and electronic transport of mixed bromide-iodide perovskite thin films performed during photo de-mixing with the evolution of their optical and morpho-logical properties. The results point to the definition of different stages of the de-mixing process which, based on micros-copy and spectroscopic measurements, we assign to regimes of spinodal decomposition and nucleation of quasi-equilibrium iodide- and bromide-rich phases. Combined with density functional theory calculations, we explore the role of dimensionality in the mechanism and reversibility of photo de-mixing and dark re-mixing processes, referring to elec-tronic and ionic contributions to the de-mixing driving force. Additionally, our data emphasizes the role of the surface, as significantly different de-mixing dynamics, in terms of extent and reversibility, are observed for films with or without encapsulation. Our comprehensive analysis of transport, phase and optical properties of mixed-halide perovskites pro-vides guidelines for future materials design as well as for the more general fundamental understanding of light-induced ionic phenomena.</description>
