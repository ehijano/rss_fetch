      <title>Human-AI Technology Integration and Green ESG Performance: Evidence from Chinese Retail Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between human-AI technology integration transformation and green Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance in Chinese retail enterprises, with green technology innovation serving as a mediating mechanism. Using panel data comprising 5,400 firm-year observations from 2019 to 2023, sourced from CNRDS and CSMAR databases, we employ fixed-effects regression models to investigate this relationship. Our findings reveal that human-AI technology integration significantly enhances green ESG performance, with green technology innovation serving as a crucial mediating pathway. The results demonstrate that a one standard-deviation increase in human-AI integration leads to a 12.7% improvement in green ESG scores. The mediation analysis confirms that approximately 35% of this effect operates through enhanced green technology innovation capabilities. Heterogeneity analysis reveals stronger effects among larger firms, state-owned enterprises, and companies in developed regions. These findings contribute to the growing literature on digital transformation and sustainability by providing empirical evidence of the mechanisms through which AI integration drives environmental performance improvements in emerging markets.</description>

      <title>User Location Disclosure Fails to Deter Overseas Criticism but Amplifies Regional Divisions on Chinese Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the behavioral impact of a user location disclosure policy implemented on Sina Weibo, China's largest microblogging platform, using a high-frequency, real-time dataset of uncensored user engagement with 165 leading government and media accounts. Leveraging a natural experiment result from the platform's sudden rollout of location tagging on April 28, 2022, we compare millions of time-stamped observations of user behavior in the comment sections of these accounts before and after the policy change. Although the policy appeared intended to deter overseas users from spreading information deemed harmful by the regime, we find no reduction in their engagement. Instead, the policy sharply reduced domestic users' willingness to comment on posts about local issues outside their own provinces. This effect was especially pronounced among out-of-province commenters and disproportionately curtailed criticisms. Using large language models, we further show that location disclosure triggered a rise in regionally discriminatory replies, which in turn heightened the perceived risk of cross-provincial engagement and reshaped the norms of online participation. Our findings suggest that authoritarian regimes can reinforce censorship not only through top-down control, but by mobilizing social cleavages, here, regional divisions, to suppress dissent and fragment public discourse.</description>

      <title>Efficiency through Evolution, A Darwinian Approach to Agent-Based Economic Forecast Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Darwinian Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) methodology formacroeconomic forecasting that leverages evolutionary principles to achieve remarkablecomputational efficiency and emergent realism. Unlike conventional DSGE and ABM approachesthat rely on complex behavioral rules derived from large firm analysis, our framework employssimple "common sense" rules representative of small firms directly serving final consumers. Themethodology treats households as the primary drivers of economic dynamics, with firms adaptingthrough market-based natural selection within limited interaction neighborhoods. We demonstrate that this approach, when constrained by Input-Output table structures,generates realistic economic patterns including wealth distributions, firm size distributions, andsectoral employment patterns without extensive parameter calibration. Using FIGARO Input-Output tables for 46 countries and focusing on Austria as a case study, we show that the modelreproduces empirical regularities while maintaining computational efficiency on standard laptopsrather than requiring supercomputing clusters. Key findings include: (1) emergence of realistic firm and employment distributions fromminimal behavioral assumptions, (2) accurate reproduction of the initial Social Accounting Matrixvalues through evolutionary dynamics, (3) successful calibration using only 5-6 country-specificparameters to complement the FIGARO data, and (4) computational performance enabling fullsimulations on consumer hardware. These results suggest that evolutionary ABM approaches canprovide robust policy insights by capturing decentralized market adaptations while avoiding thecomputational complexity of traditional DSGE and comprehensive ABM models.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Probability Weighting and Portfolio Optimization under Semi-Heavy Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework that integrates behavioral distortions into rational portfolio optimization by extracting implied probability weighting functions (PWFs) from optimal portfolios modeled under Gaussian and Normal-Inverse-Gaussian (NIG) return distributions. Using DJIA constituents, we construct mean-CVaR99 frontiers, alongwith Sharpe- and CVaR-maximizing portfolios, and estimate PWFs that capture nonlinear beliefs consistent with fear and greed. We show that increasing tail fatness amplifies these distortions and that shifts in the term structure of risk-free rates alter their curvature. The results highlight the importance of jointly modeling return asymmetry and belief distortions in portfolio risk management and capital allocation under extreme-risk environments.</description>

      <title>Measuring Social Media Network Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use representative, incentive-compatible online choice experiments involving 19,923 Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X users in the US to provide the first large-scale, empirical measurement of local network effects in the digital economy. Our analysis reveals social media platform value ranges from $78 to $101 per consumer, per month, on average, and that 20-34% of that value is explained by local network effects. We also find 1) stronger ties are more valuable on Facebook and Instagram, while weaker ties are more valuable on LinkedIn and X; 2) connections known through work are most valuable on LinkedIn and least valuable on Facebook, and people looking for work value LinkedIn significantly more and Facebook significantly less than people not looking for work; 3) men value connections to women on social media significantly more than they value connections to other men, particularly on Instagram, Facebook and X, while women value connections to men and women equally; 4) white consumers value relationships with other white consumers significantly more than they value relationships with non-white consumers on Facebook while, on Instagram, connections to alters eighteen years old or younger are valued significantly more than any other age group-two patterns not seen on any other platforms. Social media platforms individually generate between $53B and $215B in consumer surplus per year in the US alone. These results suggest social media generates significant value, local network effects drive a substantial fraction of that value and that these effects vary across platforms, consumers, and connections.</description>

      <title>The Geopolitical Determinants of Economic Growth, 1960-2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes geopolitical relations as a first-order determinant of economic growth. We construct a novel event-based measure of bilateral geopolitical alignment by employing large language models with web search capabilities to analyze over 440,000 political events across 196 countries from 1960--2019. This comprehensive measure enables us to identify the precise timing and magnitude of geopolitical shifts within countries over time. Using local projections with country fixed effects, we find that a one-standard-deviation improvement in geopolitical relations increases GDP per capita by 9.6 log points over 25 years. These persistent effects operate through multiple reinforcing channels -- enhanced political stability, increased investment, expanded trade, and productivity gains. Across our sample, geopolitical factors generate GDP variations ranging from -35% to +30%, with developing nations facing particularly severe penalties from international isolation. Our findings reveal how geopolitical alignment shapes economic prosperity in an increasingly fragmented global economy.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous participation and allocation skews: when is choice "worth it"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core ethos of the Economics and Computation (EconCS) community is that people have complex private preferences and information of which the central planner is unaware, but which an appropriately designed mechanism can uncover to improve collective decisionmaking. This ethos underlies the community's largest deployed success stories, from stable matching systems to participatory budgeting. I ask: is this choice and information aggregation ``worth it''? In particular, I discuss how such systems induce \textit{heterogeneous participation}: those already relatively advantaged are, empirically, more able to pay time costs and navigate administrative burdens imposed by the mechanisms. I draw on three case studies, including my own work -- complex democratic mechanisms, resident crowdsourcing, and school matching. I end with lessons for practice and research, challenging the community to help reduce participation heterogeneity and design and deploy mechanisms that meet a ``best of both worlds'' north star: \textit{use preferences and information from those who choose to participate, but provide a ``sufficient'' quality of service to those who do not.}</description>

      <title>Consumption Partial Insurance in the Presence of Tail Income Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13208v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple framework to measure consumption insurance against income shocks that accounts for higher-order moments of the income distribution. We derive a nonlinear consumption function in which the extent of insurance varies with both the sign and magnitude of shocks. Using recent PSID data, we estimate an asymmetric pass-through of bad versus good permanent shocks - 17% of a 3 sigma negative shock transmits to consumption versus 9% of an equal-sized positive shock - with greater pass-through as shocks worsen. These consumption transmission rates further vary by age, wealth, and along the income distribution. Our results align with survey responses to hypothetical events and suggest that tail risk matters substantially for consumption.</description>

      <title>Competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage: novel measures show no evidence of decline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19222v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competitive balance, which refers to the level of control teams have over a sports competition, is a crucial indicator for tournament organisers. According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces alternative indices to investigate this issue. Two ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, and four dynamic concentration indicators compare the final group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. Using these indices, we find no evidence of any long-run trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>

Abstract: The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) poses new and poorly understood threats to financial stability. We use a game-theoretic model to analyse the stability impact of AI, finding that it amplifies existing financial system vulnerabilities - leverage, liquidity stress and opacity - through superior information processing, common data, speed and strategic complementarities. The consequence is crises become faster and more severe, where the likelihood of a crisis is directly affected by how effectively the authorities engage with AI. In response, we propose that the financial authorities develop their own AI systems and expertise, establish direct AI-to-AI communication, implement automated crisis facilities and monitor AI use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a dynamic optimization framework for evaluating the optimal longevity of a dynasty under a critical-level utilitarian social welfare criterion. Unlike standard models that assume an infinite planning horizon and apply discounting to future generations, we endogenize the planning horizon itself and examine the welfare-maximizing number of generations in a roundabout production economy with capital accumulation. The model incorporates a well-being threshold that must be met for generational existence to be considered ethically justified, providing an alternative to traditional utilitarian aggregation. Using finite-horizon dynamic programming, we derive closed-form consumption trajectories and analyze how technological parameters and intertemporal preferences affect the optimal generational span. Our results show that the optimal horizon need not be infinite -- even under zero discounting -- and that intergenerational equity may require limiting dynasty length.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Elasticity on a Private On-the-Job Search Platform: Evidence from Japan, 2014-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I use proprietary data from the online job scouting platform BizReach in Japan, spanning from 2014 to 2024, to estimate the matching function for high-skill employed workers on a private on-the-job search platform, employing a novel nonparametric approach developed by Lange and Papageorgiou (2020). This analysis is compared to the public off-the-job search platform, Hello Work. The results indicate that matching efficiency on the private platform is both more volatile and higher than that of the public platform, suggesting the increasing popularity of the private platform. The matching elasticity with respect to users consistently hovers around 0.75, while the elasticity with respect to vacancies reaches approximately 1.0, indicating a higher and more balanced elasticity compared to the Hello Work platform. Additionally, the study reveals evidence of industry-level heterogeneity on the private platform.</description>

      <title>Price Regulation, Technology and Provider Redistribution: Insights from Parity Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do price regulations lead to inefficiencies and trade loss? The answer depends on the type of regulation, monetary and non-monetary factors influencing demand, technological factors affecting supply elasticities, difference between pre-regulation and expected post-regulation prices, and geographical area. State-level variations in telehealth parity laws provide a unique opportunity to study the effects of Price Controls and Cost Controls on healthcare service quantity, proxied by physician count, across metro and non-metro areas, with broadband as a technological mediator. At the micro level, Price Controls distort the input mix, causing production inefficiency and rotating the supply curve. Cost Controls change the consumption mix, causing consumption inefficiency and rotating the demand curve. This results in equilibrium quantity shifts causing allocative inefficiency in healthcare provision, signified by physician redistribution at the macro level. The micro-founded non-price competition models predicts shifts from unregulated to regulated equilibrium quantities under various combinations of Price Control and Cost Control types. Empirical analysis supports these predictions, showing that a Price Ceiling or Price Floor positively affects physician count in metro areas but negatively in non-metro areas. Conversely, Cost Parity has a negative effect in metro areas, while a Cost Ceiling positively impacts physician count in both regions. When examining combinations of different types of Price and Cost Controls, Cost Parity tends to dominate with a net negative effect, whereas a Cost Ceiling amplifies the positive effect of a Price Ceiling. The findings challenge the conventional narratives and underscore the role of regional disparities and technology in shaping policy outcomes.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Portfolio Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variance measures the portfolio risks the investors are taking. The investor, who holds his portfolio and doesn't trade his shares, at the current time can use the time series of the market trades that were made during the averaging interval with the securities of his portfolio and assess the current return, variance, and hence the current risks of his portfolio. We show how the time series of trades with the securities of the portfolio determine the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market security. The time series of trades with the portfolio determine its return and variance in the same form as the time series of trades with securities determine their returns and variances. The description of any portfolio and any single market security is equal. The time series of the portfolio trades define the decomposition of the portfolio variance by its securities, which is a quadratic form in the variables of relative amounts invested into securities. Its coefficients themselves are quadratic forms in the variables of relative numbers of shares of its securities. If one assumes that the volumes of all consecutive deals with each security are constant, the decomposition of the portfolio variance coincides with Markowitz's (1952) variance, which ignores the effects of random trade volumes. The use of the variance that accounts for the randomness of trade volumes could help majors like BlackRock, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed to adjust their models, like Aladdin and Azimov, to the reality of random markets.</description>

      <title>Do conditional cash transfers in childhood increase economic resilience in adulthood? Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic shock in Ecuador</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary goal of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) is to alleviate short-term poverty while preventing the intergenerational transmission of deprivation by promoting the accumulation of human capital among children. Although a substantial body of research has evaluated the short-run impacts of CCTs, studies on their long-term effects are relatively scarce, and evidence regarding their influence on resilience to future economic shocks is limited. As human capital accumulation is expected to enhance individuals' ability to cope with risk and uncertainty during turbulent periods, we investigate whether receiving a conditional cash transfer -- specifically, the Human Development Grant (HDG) in Ecuador -- during childhood improves the capacity to respond to unforeseen exogenous economic shocks in adulthood, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and leveraging merged administrative data, we do not find an overall effect of the HDG on the target population. Nevertheless, we present evidence that individuals who were eligible for the programme and lived in rural areas (where previous works have found the largest effects in terms of on short-term impact) during their childhood, approximately 12 years before the pandemic, exhibited greater economic resilience to the pandemic. In particular, eligibility increased the likelihood of remaining employed in the formal sector during some of the most challenging phases of the COVID-19 crisis. The likely drivers of these results are the weak conditionality of the HDG and demand factors given the limited ability of the formal economy to absorb labour, even if more educated.</description>

      <title>Early and Accurate Recession Detection Using Classifiers on the Anticipation-Precision Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a new algorithm for detecting US recessions in real time. The algorithm constructs millions of recession classifiers by combining unemployment and vacancy data to reduce detection noise. Classifiers are then selected to avoid both false negatives (missed recessions) and false positives (nonexistent recessions). The selected classifiers are therefore perfect, in that they identify all 15 historical recessions in the 1929--2021 training period without any false positives. By further selecting classifiers that lie on the high-precision segment of the anticipation-precision frontier, the algorithm optimizes early detection without sacrificing precision. On average, over 1929--2021, the classifier ensemble signals recessions 2.2 months after their true onset, with a standard deviation of detection errors of 1.9 months. Applied to May 2025 data, the classifier ensemble gives a 71% probability that the US economy is currently in recession. A placebo test and backtests confirm the algorithm's reliability. The classifier ensembles trained on 1929--2004, 1929--1984, and 1929--1964 data in backtests give a current recession probability of 58%, 83%, and 25%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Introducing a New Brexit-Related Uncertainty Index: Its Evolution and Economic Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Important game-changer economic events and transformations cause uncertainties that may affect investment decisions, capital flows, international trade, and macroeconomic variables. One such major transformation is Brexit, which refers to the multiyear process through which the UK withdrew from the EU. This study develops and uses a new Brexit-Related Uncertainty Index (BRUI). In creating this index, we apply Text Mining, Context Window, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs) from Deep Learning techniques to analyse the monthly country reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit from May 2012 to January 2025. Additionally, we employ a standard vector autoregression (VAR) analysis to examine the model-implied responses of various macroeconomic variables to BRUI shocks. While developing the BRUI, we also create a complementary COVID-19 Related Uncertainty Index (CRUI) to distinguish the uncertainties stemming from these distinct events. Empirical findings and comparisons of BRUI with other earlier-developed uncertainty indexes demonstrate the robustness of the new index. This new index can assist British policymakers in measuring and understanding the impacts of Brexit-related uncertainties, enabling more effective policy formulation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Efficiency of Regulation in Matching Markets with Distributional Disparities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cap-based regulations are widely used to address distributional disparities in matching markets, but their efficiency relative to alternative instruments such as subsidies remains poorly understood. This paper develops a framework for evaluating policy interventions by incorporating regional constraints into a transferable utility matching model. We show that a policymaker with aggregate-level match data can implement a taxation policy that maximizes social welfare and outperforms any cap-based policy. Using newly collected data from the Japan Residency Matching Program, we estimate participant preferences and simulate counterfactual match outcomes under both cap-based and subsidy-based policies. The results reveal that the status quo cap-based regulation generates substantial efficiency losses, whereas small, targeted subsidies can achieve similar distributional goals with significantly higher social welfare.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Interactions and Societal Pitfalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10448v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When working with generative artificial intelligence (AI), users may see productivity gains, but the AI-generated content may not match their preferences exactly. To study this effect, we introduce a Bayesian framework in which heterogeneous users choose how much information to share with the AI, facing a trade-off between output fidelity and communication cost. We show that the interplay between these individual-level decisions and AI training may lead to societal challenges. Outputs may become more homogenized, especially when the AI is trained on AI-generated content, potentially triggering a homogenization death spiral. And any AI bias may propagate to become societal bias. A solution to the homogenization and bias issues is to reduce human-AI interaction frictions and enable users to flexibly share information, leading to personalized outputs without sacrificing productivity.</description>

      <title>In the Shadow of Smith`s Invisible Hand: Risks to Economic Stability and Social Wellbeing in the Age of Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01545</link>

Abstract: Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing financial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job displacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour underutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index by 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary. Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study underscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work together to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard the Mental Wealth of nations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Multiple DER Aggregators on Wholesale Energy Markets: A Hybrid Mean Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy markets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV panels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to ensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We study a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each controlling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf of the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the repeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and adapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other and with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping wholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We model this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses market information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants -- to enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed decisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their portfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control (MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal strategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market conditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly reach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field learning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without storage.</description>

      <title>AI is the Strategy: From Agentic AI to Autonomous Business Models onto Strategy in the Age of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article develops the concept of Autonomous Business Models (ABMs) as a distinct managerial and strategic logic in the age of agentic AI. While most firms still operate within human-driven or AI-augmented models, we argue that we are now entering a phase where agentic AI (systems capable of initiating, coordinating, and adapting actions autonomously) can increasingly execute the core mechanisms of value creation, delivery, and capture. This shift reframes AI not as a tool to support strategy, but as the strategy itself. Using two illustrative cases, getswan.ai, an Israeli startup pursuing autonomy by design, and a hypothetical reconfiguration of Ryanair as an AI-driven incumbent, we depict the evolution from augmented to autonomous business models. We show how ABMs reshape competitive advantage through agentic execution, continuous adaptation, and the gradual offloading of human decision-making. This transition introduces new forms of competition between AI-led firms, which we term synthetic competition, where strategic interactions occur at rapid, machine-level speed and scale. It also challenges foundational assumptions in strategy, organizational design, and governance. By positioning agentic AI as the central actor in business model execution, the article invites us to rethink strategic management in an era where firms increasingly run themselves.</description>
