      <title>Master stability curves for traveling waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the spectrum and stability of traveling waves in spatially discrete systems quickly becomes unfeasible with increasing system size. We present a framework for effectively determining the spectrum and stability of traveling waves in discrete systems with symmetries (such as rings and lattices) by computing master stability curves. We show that wave destabilization and multi-stability between waves can be determined from the position and curvature of master stability curves independently of the number of constituents. To illustrate our framework, we compute and analyze master stability curves of traveling waves (that take the form of pulse trains) in diffusively coupled rings of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators.</description>

      <title>An amplitude equation for the conserved-Hopf bifurcation -- derivation, analysis and assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ weakly nonlinear theory to derive an amplitude equation for the conserved-Hopf instability, i.e., a generic large-scale oscillatory instability for systems with two conservation laws. The resulting equation represents in the conserved case the equivalent of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation obtained in the nonconserved case as amplitude equation for the standard Hopf bifurcation. Considering first the case of a relatively simple symmetric Cahn-Hilliard model with purely nonreciprocal coupling, we derive the nonlinear nonlocal amplitude equation with real coefficients and show that its bifurcation diagram and time evolution well agree with results for the full model. The solutions of the amplitude equation and their stability are analytically obtained thereby showing that in oscillatory phase separation the suppression of coarsening is universal. Second, we lift the two restrictions and obtain the amplitude equation in the generic case that has complex coefficients, that also shows very good agreement with the full model as exemplified for some transient dynamics that converges to traveling wave states.</description>
