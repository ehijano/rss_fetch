      <title>Non-invertible bosonic chiral symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we realize the 3 + 1 dimensional non-invertible ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ chiral symmetry generator as an operator in a many body lattice Hilbert space. A crucial ingredient in our construction is the use of infinite dimensional $U(1)$ rotor site Hilbert spaces. Specifically, our Hilbert space is that of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory coupled to a charge $1$ scalar in the Villain formulation, which allows for direct access to monopoles and for a simple definition of a magnetic ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ one-form symmetry $Z^{(1)}_m$ , at the lattice Hamiltonian level. We construct the generator of the ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ chiral symmetry as as a unitary operator in the subspace of $Z^{(1)}_m$-invariant states, and show that it cannot be extended to the entire Hilbert space while preserving locality and unitarity. Using a lattice-level duality based on gauging $Z^{(1)}_m$, we find a dual description of this subspace, as the subspace of a charge $1/N$ gauge theory invariant under an electric one-form symmetry $Z^{(1)}_e$. We show that in this dual formulation, the chiral symmetry generator does extend unitarily to the entire Hilbert space, but has a mixed anomaly with the $Z^{(1)}_e$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Probing Hidden Symmetry and Altermagnetism with Sub-Picometer Sensitivity via Nonlinear Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray and neutron diffraction are foundational tools for determining crystal structures, but their resolution limits can lead to misassignments, especially in materials with subtle distortions or competing phases. Here, we demonstrate the use of nonlinear transport as a complementary approach to uncover hidden crystal symmetries, using the strongly correlated Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ as a case study. Below 48 K (T$_S$), where the magnetic moments of the antiferromagnetic phase reorient from the a- to the b-axis, leading to a pseudogap opening, our measurements, with support of DFT, reveal a previously overlooked lower-symmetry phase. This is manifested by the emergence of longitudinal nonlinear resistance (NLR) along the b-axis below T$_S$, providing direct evidence of combined translational and time-reversal symmetry breaking. This response also suggests a transformation from a conventional antiferromagnet into an altermagnet. The lower-symmetry phase arises from a subtle lattice distortion (~0.1 pm) associated with the magnetic transition at T$_S$, below the detection limit of conventional diffraction. Moreover, this NLR below T$_S$ is accompanied by a nonlinear Hall effect, both of which are enhanced by the large quantum metric associated with Weyl chains near the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate nonlinear transport as a sensitive probe of hidden symmetry breaking and altermagnetism, complementing and extending beyond the reach of traditional diffraction and spectroscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>Chirality/Axiality-Induced Axiality/Chirality via Surface Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18209v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In condensed matter physics, a broad spectrum of physical characteristics, such as chirality, axiality, and polarity, arises as a direct consequence of the underlying symmetry of the system. We here theoretically investigate the effective coupling between chirality and axiality at their domain boundaries, mediated by polarity. Based on symmetry considerations and model analyses, we propose the concept of chirality-induced axiality via surface polarization, which refers to a phenomenon where the handedness of chirality selects an axial moment with a particular orientation by lowering its energy at the surface. We further establish the inverse process, termed axiality-induced chirality via surface polarization, whereby axiality in turn dictates the preferred chirality. These reciprocal couplings open a new pathway for stabilizing single-domain states of chirality and axiality. They further imply interfacial functionalities, including the selective adsorption of chiral and axial molecules.</description>

      <title>KVASIR: A backscattering neutron spectrometer for hard condensed matter at ESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the instrument concept for KVASIR, a backscattering indirect time-of-flight neutron spectrometer for the European Spallation Source (ESS). KVASIR will probe low lying excitations of single crystal hard condensed matter that many advanced technologies rely upon. The instrument is simultaneously optimized for high resolution of energy-and momentum transfer, while ensuring perturbation by high magnetic fields. Detailed ray tracing simulations, considering the true geometry and aberrations of the analyser configuration have been performed. The proposed concept has room for polarisation analysis and extreme sample environments. Inelastic neutron scattering studies of single crystal hard condensed matter, with a particular focus on quantum, at yet unseen spatial and dynamic precision under extreme conditions are hereby enabled.</description>

      <title>Modulated symmetries from generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries rigidly delimit the landscape of quantum matter. Recently uncovered spatially modulated symmetries, whose actions vary with position, enable excitations with restricted mobility, while Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) type anomalies impose sharp constraints on which lattice phases are realizable. In one dimensional a spin chain, gauging procedures have linked modulated symmetry to LSM type anomaly, but a general understanding beyond 1D remains incomplete. We show that spatially modulated symmetries and their associated dipole algebras naturally emerge from gauging ordinary symmetries in the presence of generalized LSM type anomalies. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and develop complementary field theoretic descriptions in arbitrary spatial dimensions that connect LSM anomaly inflow to higher-group symmetry structures governing the modulated symmetries. Our results provide a unified, nonperturbative framework that ties together LSM constraints and spatially modulated symmetries across dimensions.</description>

      <title>Vector spin polarization evolution determined in an entangled muon-fluorine system under pulsed excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin-polarized muon implanted into a fluoride forms a coupled F--$\mu$--F complex in which the muon spin and neighbouring fluorine nuclear spins become entangled. Here we apply radio-frequency (RF) excitation to this coupled system and use the three-dimensional distribution of emitted positrons to reconstruct the time-dependent evolution of the muon spin polarization. This three-dimensional readout, using single spin detection, is not possible in a single NMR experiment and demonstrates significant advantages that are achieved by using RF muon techniques. We demonstrate the application of this vector-readout method to the experimental observation of a muon spin echo signal that is controlled by the dipolar coupling to fluorine, as well as to a double resonance experiment, in which we use pulses tuned to separate frequencies to address both the muon and fluorine spins. This targeted approach, in which selective RF pulses can control the muon spin and other spins to which it is coupled, provides a novel route for probing systems of entangled spins.</description>

      <title>Instabilities of a Generalized Gross-Neveu Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the instabilities to the conformal critical point of an exactly solvable family of Gross-Neveu models. Using conformal field theory techniques, we construct the zero-temperature phase diagram and identify the superconducting and ferromagnetic phases that destabilize the critical point. Both instabilities appear only when the fermions are strongly renormalized, above a critical anomalous dimension. A higher fermion anomalous dimension also raises the critical degree of time-reversal-symmetry breaking required to suppress superconductivity, indicating that pairing becomes more robust with stronger renormalization.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic-Strain Control of The Magnetic Structure in Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A first principles study is conducted to explore the changes in the magnetic structure of Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN under anisotropic biaxial strain. Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN is an antiperovskite with a structure similar to that of an ideal cubic perovskite. Several manganese nitride antiperovskites including Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN were reported to have a frustrated noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure. Successful electric switching of its magnetic structure has been reported. Furthermore, despite a cubic lattice symmetry, the magnetic symmetry is rhombohedral, allowing a piezomagnetic response. Tensile biaxial strain has been shown to produce a net magnetic moment by inducing in-plane spin canting. Compressive biaxial strain has been used to induce a spin-polarized ferro- or ferrimagnetic phase. In this study, anisotropic strain in the (001) plane is applied, outlining a magnetic phase diagram that can predict the properties when growing Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN thin films on noncubic substrates. The lattice vectors along the a and b crystallographic axes are strained by -5\% to 5\% in percentwise increments in all permutations. An extensive phase diagram is mapped, revealing multiple combinations of strain applied to the two lattice vectors that result in a ferro- or ferrimagnetic transition. Unlike previous results, not only strictly compressive strain on both lattice vectors, but combinations of tensile and compressive strain, as well as uniaxial strain, are seen producing the magnetic phase transitions. Furthermore, while biquadratic strain was seen producing a net moment in the [110] direction under tensile strain and [\bar{1}\bar{1}0] under compressive strain, anisotropic strain allows tuning the direction of the net magnetization.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum Resolved by Loop Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigorous analysis is presented for the entanglement spectrum of quantum many-body states possessing a higher-form group-representation symmetry generated by topological Wilson loops, which is generally non-invertible. A general framework based on elementary algebraic topology and category theory is developed to determine the block structure of reduced density matrices for arbitrary bipartite manifolds on which the states are defined. Within this framework, we scrutinize the impact of topology on the entanglement structure for low-dimensional manifolds, including especially the torus, the Klein bottle, and lens spaces. By further incorporating gauge invariance, we refine our framework to determine the entanglement structure for topological gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, in two dimensions, it is shown for the Kitaev quantum double model that not only the topological entanglement entropy can be reproduced, but also the Li-Haldane conjecture concerning the full entanglement spectrum holds exactly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the multipartite entanglement structure of quantum states prepared by the Euclidean path integral over three-manifolds with multiple torus boundaries (the so-called link states) in both Abelian and non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories. For three-component link states in the Abelian theory, we derive an explicit formula for the R\'enyi multi-entropy in terms of linking numbers. We further show that the genuine multi-entropy faithfully quantifies the tripartite entanglement generated by GHZ-states, consistent with the fact that the prepared states are stabilizer states.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of cluster-based Haldane and bound-magnon states in a spin-1 Heisenberg diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a spin-1 Heisenberg diamond chain in a magnetic field using a combination of analytical and numerical methods including the variational approach, exact diagonalization, density-matrix renormalization group, localized-magnon theory, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the unfrustrated regime, the model exhibits a quantum ferrimagnetic phase that captures key magnetic features of the nickel-based polymeric compound [Ni3(OH)2(C4H2O4)(H2O)4].2H2O such as a at minimum in the temperature dependence of the susceptibility times temperature product and an intermediate one-third magnetization plateau. In the frustrated regime, we uncover a rich variety of unconventional quantum phases including uniform and cluster-based Haldane states, fragmented monomer-dimer phase, and bound-magnon crystals. Analysis of the adiabatic temperature change and magnetic Gruneisen parameter reveals an enhanced magnetocaloric effect near field-induced transitions between these exotic quantum phases. Additionally, we demonstrate that the frustrated spin-1 diamond chain can operate as an efficient working medium of a quantum Stirling engine, which approaches near-optimal efficiency when driven into these unconventional quantum states.</description>

      <title>Large deviations in the many-body localization transition: The case of the random-field XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of rare system-wide resonances in the many-body localization (MBL) transition has recently attracted significant attention. They are expected to play a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the development of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their statistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field disordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission amplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply it to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, which formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the influence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators, we identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading in Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by rare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase where such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size phase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the Anderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based on real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even infinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite disorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction strengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space graph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral probes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes stems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and shorter-ranged deep in the localized phase.</description>

      <title>Covariant field theory of 3D massive fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a covariant and gauge-invariant theory describing massive fractons in three spacetime dimensions, based on a symmetric rank-2 tensor field. The model includes a Chern-Simons-like term that plays a dual role: it generates a topological mass for the tensor gauge field and simultaneously acts as a source of intrinsic fractonic matter. This dual mechanism is novel and leads to a propagating fractonic degree of freedom described by a massive Klein-Gordon equation. The theory propagates two degrees of freedom -- one massive, one massless -- whose number is preserved in the massless limit, in analogy with the Maxwell-Chern-Simons mechanism of Deser-Jackiw-Templeton. We analyze the resulting equations of motion and show that the intrinsic fractonic matter satisfies Gauss- and Amp\`ere-like laws, with conserved dipole and trace of the quadrupole moment. Upon coupling to external matter, a second fractonic sector emerges, leading to a coexistence of intrinsic and extrinsic subsystems with different mobility and conservation properties. Our model provides a unified framework for describing massive fractons with internal structure, and offers a covariant setting for exploring their interactions and extensions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian learning quantum magnets with dynamical impurity tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale engineered spin systems, ranging from spins on surfaces to nanographenes, provide flexible platforms to realize entangled quantum magnets from a bottom up approach. However, assessing the quantum many-body Hamiltonian realized in a specific experiment remains an exceptional open challenge, due to the difficulty of disentangling competing terms accounting for the many-body excitations. Here, we demonstrate a machine learning strategy to learn a quantum many-body spin Hamiltonian from scanning spectroscopy measurements of spin excitations. Our methodology leverages the spatially-resolved reconstruction of the many-body excitations induced by depositing quantum impurities next to the quantum magnet. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows us to predict long-range Heisenberg exchange interactions, anisotropic exchange, as well as antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, including in the presence of sizable noise. Our methodology establishes defect-induced spatially-resolved dynamical excitations in quantum magnets as a powerful strategy to understand the nature of quantum spin many-body models.</description>

      <title>Sharp Transitions for Subsystem Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circuit complexity of time-evolved pure quantum states grows linearly in time for an exponentially long time. This behavior has been proven in certain models, is conjectured to hold for generic quantum many-body systems, and is believed to be dual to the long-time growth of black hole interiors in AdS/CFT. Achieving a similar understanding for mixed states remains an important problem. In this work, we study the circuit complexity of time-evolved subsystems of pure quantum states. We find that for greater-than-half subsystem sizes, the complexity grows linearly in time for an exponentially long time, similarly to that of the full state. However, for less-than-half subsystem sizes, the complexity rises and then falls, returning to low complexity as the subsystem equilibrates. Notably, the transition between these two regimes occurs sharply at half system size. We use holographic duality to map out this picture of subsystem complexity dynamics and rigorously prove the existence of the sharp transition in random quantum circuits. Furthermore, we use holography to predict features of complexity growth at finite temperature that lie beyond the reach of techniques based on random quantum circuits. In particular, at finite temperature, we argue for an additional sharp transition at a critical less-than-half subsystem size. Below this critical value, the subsystem complexity saturates nearly instantaneously rather than exhibiting a rise and fall. This novel phenomenon, as well as an analogous transition above half system size, provides a target for future studies based on rigorous methods.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Intertwined Orders in the Strongly Correlated Kagome Metal CsCr3Sb5</title>

Abstract: While correlated phenomena of flat bands have been extensively studied in twisted systems, the ordered states that emerge from interactions in the intrinsic flat bands of kagome lattice materials remain largely unexplored. The newly discovered kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 offers a unique and rich platform for this research, as its multi-orbital flat bands at the Fermi surface result in a complex interplay of pressurized superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, a structural phase transition, and density wave orders. Here, using ultrafast optical techniques, we provide strong spectroscopic evidence for a charge density wave transition in CsCr3Sb5, resolving previous ambiguities. Crucially, we identify rotational symmetry breaking that manifests as a three-state Potts-type nematicity. Our elastoresistance measurements directly demonstrate the electronic origin of this order, as the rotational-symmetry-breaking E2g component of the elastoresistance shows a divergent behaviour around the transition temperature. This exotic nematicity results from the lifting of degeneracy of the multi-orbital flat bands, akin to phenomena seen in certain iron-based superconductors. Our study pioneers the investigation of ultrafast dynamics in flat-band systems at the Fermi surface, offering new insights into the interactions between multiple elementary excitations in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, pivot Hamiltonians and symmetry-protected topological phases</title>

Abstract: Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian parameter inference from resonant inelastic x-ray scattering with active learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying model Hamiltonians is a vital step toward creating predictive models of materials. Here, we combine Bayesian optimization with the EDRIXS numerical package to infer Hamiltonian parameters from resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra within the single atom approximation. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, we test it on experimental RIXS spectra of NiPS3, NiCl2, Ca3LiOsO6, and Fe2O3, and demonstrate that it can reproduce results obtained from hand-fitted parameters to a precision similar to expert human analysis while providing a more systematic mapping of parameter space. Our work provides a key first step toward solving the inverse scattering problem to extract effective multi-orbital models from information-dense RIXS measurements, which can be applied to a host of quantum materials. We also propose atomic model parameter sets for two materials, Ca3LiOsO6 and Fe2O3, that were previously missing from the literature.</description>

      <title>Spin-flop-like transition as quantum critical point in Cs$_2$RuO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report thermodynamic, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Cs$_2$RuO$_4$, a member of the celebrated family of frustrated magnets Cs$_2$MX$_4$ (M = Cu, Co, X = Br, Cl). Unlike the previously studied members, it is based on $4d$ transition metal ions with $S=1$. Mapping out the $H-T$ magnetic phase diagram reveals an unusual continuous spin-flop-like phase transition associated with a quantum critical point within the antiferromagnetically ordered phase. A quantitative analysis of the complex magnetic excitation spectrum measured in zero field allows us to derive a model magnetic Hamiltonian for this compound. Its main feature is a frustration of magnetic anisotropy on a level that is much higher than in any of the previously studied species. This frustration naturally explains the peculiar phase transition observed.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of the Momentum-Resolved Static Spin Susceptibility in a Mott-Proximate Cuprate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the temperature dependence of the static spin susceptibility at $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, \pi)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, 0)$ in a Mott-proximate cuprate model with an antinodal pseudogap -- a model system for high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates.
  The results show the susceptibility onset temperature tracks the critical temperature ($T_c$) of HTSCs with a comparable scale across the electron filling factor. Also, as the electron filling decreases and the chemical potential approaches the antinodal van Hove region, the susceptibility at $\mathbf{q}=(\pi,0)$ -- the axial particle-hole response -- grows markedly.
  The emergence of cuprate superconductivity correlates with a suppression of low-energy antinodal spin response and associated particle-hole excitations, which would otherwise dephase $d$-wave pairing, commonly attributed to spin fluctuations. In this context, the pseudogap partially suppresses antinodal spectral weight near $\omega = 0$, thereby reducing the low-$\omega$ particle-hole phase space.</description>

      <title>Protocols for Creating Anyons and Defects via Gauging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating and manipulating anyons and symmetry defects in topological phases, especially those with a non-Abelian character, constitutes a primitive for topological quantum computation. We provide a physical protocol for implementing the ribbon operators of non-Abelian anyons and symmetry defects. We utilize dualities, in particular the Kramers-Wannier or gauging map, which have previously been used to construct topologically ordered ground states by relating them to simpler states. In this work, ribbon operators are implemented by applying a gauging procedure to a lower-dimensional region of such states. This protocol uses sequential unitary circuits or, in certain cases, constant-depth adaptive circuits. We showcase this for anyons and defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ toric code and $S_3$ quantum double. The general applicability of our method is demonstrated by deriving unitary expressions for ribbon operators of various (twisted) quantum doubles.</description>

      <title>Trapped-ion quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model as a lattice gauge theory using hardware-aware native gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) is a simple yet rich model of strongly interacting electrons with complex dynamics and a variety of emerging quantum phases. These properties make it a compelling target for digital quantum simulation. Trotterization-based quantum simulations have shown promise, but implementations on current hardware are limited by noise, necessitating error mitigation techniques like circuit optimization and post-selection. A mapping of the FHM to a Z2 LGT was recently proposed that restricts the dynamics to a subspace protected by additional symmetries, and its ability for post-selection error mitigation was verified through noisy classical simulations. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a suite of algorithm-hardware co-design strategies on a trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting two key aspects of NISQ-era quantum simulation: circuit compilation and error mitigation. In particular, a novel combination of iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) and subsystem von Neumann Entropy compression reduces the 2-qubit gate count of FHM quantum simulation by 35%, consequently doubling the number of simulatable Trotter steps when used in tandem with error mitigation based on conserved symmetries, debiasing and sharpening techniques. Our work demonstrates the value of algorithm-hardware co-design to operate digital quantum simulators at the threshold of maximum circuit depths allowed by current hardware, and is broadly generalizable to strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry and materials science.</description>

      <title>Parent Lindbladians for Matrix Product Density Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum phases of matter is a fundamental goal in physics. For pure states, the representatives of phases are the ground states of locally interacting Hamiltonians, which are also renormalization fixed points (RFPs). These RFP states are exactly described by tensor networks. Extending this framework to mixed states, matrix product density operators (MPDOs) which are RFPs are believed to encapsulate mixed-state phases of matter in one dimension, where non-trivial topological phases have already been shown to exist. However, to better motivate the physical relevance of those states, and in particular the physical relevance of the recently found non-trivial phases, it remains an open question whether such MPDO RFPs can be realized as steady states of local Lindbladians. In this work, we resolve this question by analytically constructing parent Lindbladians for MPDO RFPs. These Lindbladians are local, frustration-free, and exhibit minimal steady-state degeneracy. Interestingly, we find that parent Lindbladians possess a rich structure that distinguishes them from their Hamiltonian counterparts. In particular, we uncover an intriguing connection between the non-commutativity of the Lindbladian terms and the fact that the corresponding MPDO RFP belongs to a non-trivial phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies the understanding of mechanisms that avoid quantum thermalization in an isolated system quenched far from equilibrium. A prominent example is Hilbert space fragmentation, which has recently emerged as an ergodicity-breaking mechanism in constrained spin models. Here, we show that Kogut--Susskind formulations of lattice gauge theories in $d+1$D ($d$ spatial and one temporal dimensions) give rise to Hilbert space fragmentation, and discuss possible implications for understanding continuum physics. Our findings not only prove that lattice gauge theories are a natural platform for Hilbert space fragmentation, they also serve as a guide to the conditions under which these models can be faithfully used to infer the thermalization properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Electric-field Quantum Sensing Exploiting a Photogenerated Charge-transfer Triplet State in a Molecular Semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising platforms for quantum sensing due to their chemically tunable Hamiltonians, enabling tailored coherence properties and interactions with external fields. However, electric field sensing remains challenging owing to typically weak spin-electric coupling (SEC) and limited directional sensitivity. Addressing these issues using heavy atoms exhibiting strong atomic spin-orbit couplings (SOC) often compromises spin coherence times. Here, we demonstrate coherent electric field sensing using a photogenerated charge-transfer (CT) spin triplet state in the organic molecule ACRSA (10-phenyl-10H,10' H-spiro\[acridine-9,9'-anthracen]-10'-one). By embedding electric field pulses within a Hahn echo sequence, we coherently manipulate the spin triplet and extract both the magnitude and directional dependence of its SEC. The measured SEC strength is approximately 0.51 Hz/(V/m), comparable to values reported in systems with strong atomic SOC, illustrating that heavy atoms are not a prerequisite for electric-field sensitivity of spin states. Our findings position organic CT triplets as chemically versatile and directionally sensitive quantum sensors of E-fields that function without atomic-SOC-mediated mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on superfluid $^3$He in nanoscale-confined geometries, we theoretically investigate the associated phase diagram in a slab geometry and perpendicular magnetic field as the size of confinement is varied. Our analysis is based on minimizing the Ginzburg--Landau free energy for the $3\times 3$ matrix superfluid order parameter for three different boundary conditions. We observe a smooth crossover from the phase diagram of the 3D system to the quasi-2D limit for slab heights of several hundred nanometres and magnetic fields of several kilogauss. We illuminate that, despite the apparent complexity of the underlying equations, many precise numerical and even analytical statements can be made about the phase structure for general values of the coefficients of the free energy functional, which can in turn be used to constrain or measure these parameters. To guide future experimental studies, we compute the phase diagram in dependence of pressure, temperature, slab height, and magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <title>Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and non-Gaussian diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out of the equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this paper, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, which increases exponentially with decreasing temperature. The dopant, hereby, only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes at rate $\alpha$, the dopant diffuses with a diffusion coefficient, $D_h$, depending non-monotonically on $\alpha$. It initially increases linearly as $D_h \propto \alpha$ for $\alpha \ll 1$ before dropping off as $\alpha^{-1}$ for $\alpha &gt; 1$. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics features self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion, especially for weak spin exchange. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient $D_h$ follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it is exponentially suppressed upon cooling.</description>

      <title>Decoding the string in terms of holographic quantum maps</title>

Abstract: It has recently been shown that the Nambu-Goto equation for a string emerges from the junction conditions in three-dimensional gravity. Holographically, gravitational junctions are dual to interfaces in conformal field theory. We demonstrate that each stringy mode of the junction corresponds to a universal $\mathcal{H}_{in}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{out}$ quantum map between in and out Hilbert spaces of excitations scattered at the interface, and also a universal $\mathcal{H}_{L}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{R}$ quantum map relating the excitations on both sides. These quantum maps generalize those realized by defect operators, preserve the conformal boundary condition at the interface, and realize a tunable energy transmitter.</description>

      <title>The Many Faces of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Zeta expansion for long-range interactions under periodic boundary conditions with applications to micromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the efficient computation of power-law-based interaction potentials of homogeneous $d$-dimensional bodies with an infinite $n$-dimensional array of copies, including their higher-order derivatives. This problem forms a serious challenge in micromagnetics with periodic boundary conditions and related fields. Nowadays, it is common practice to truncate the associated infinite lattice sum to a finite number of images, introducing uncontrolled errors. We show that, for general interacting geometries, the exact infinite sum for both dipolar interactions and generalized Riesz power-law potentials can be obtained by complementing a small direct sum by a correction term that involves efficiently computable derivatives of generalized zeta functions. We show that the resulting representation converges exponentially in the derivative order, reaching machine precision at a computational cost no greater than that of truncated summation schemes. In order to compute the generalized zeta functions efficiently, we provide a superexponentially convergent algorithm for their evaluation, as well as for all required special functions, such as incomplete Bessel functions. Magnetic fields can thus be evaluated to machine precision in arbitrary cuboidal domains periodically extended along one or two dimensions. We benchmark our method against known formulas for magnetic interactions and against direct summation for Riesz potentials with large exponents, consistently achieving full precision. In addition, we identify new corrections to the asymptotic limit of the demagnetization field and tabulate high-precision benchmark values that can be used as a reliable reference for micromagnetic solvers. The techniques developed are broadly applicable, with direct impact in other areas such as molecular dynamics.</description>
