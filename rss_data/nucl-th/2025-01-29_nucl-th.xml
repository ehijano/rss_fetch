      <title>The thermal index of neutron-star matter in the virial approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by gravitational wave observations of binary neutron-star mergers, we study the thermal index of low-density, high-temperature dense matter. We use the virial expansion to account for nuclear interaction effects. We focus on the region of validity of the expansion, which reaches $10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$ at $T=5$ MeV up to almost saturation density at $T=50$ MeV. In pure neutron matter, we find an analytical expression for the thermal index, and show that it is nearly density- and temperature-independent, within a fraction of a percent of the non-interacting, non-relativistic value of $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 5/3$. When we incorporate protons, electrons and photons, we find that the density and temperature dependence of the thermal index changes significantly. We predict a smooth transition between an electron-dominated regime with $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 4/3$ at low densities to a neutron-dominated region with $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 5/3$ at high densities. This behavior is by and large independent of proton fraction and is not affected by nuclear interactions in the region where the virial expansion converges. We model this smooth transition analytically and provide a simple but accurate parametrization of the inflection point between these regimes. When compared to tabulated realistic models of the thermal index, we find an overall agreement at high temperatures that weakens for colder matter. The discrepancies can be attributed to the missing contributions of nuclear clusters. The virial approximation provides a clear and physically intuitive framework for understanding the thermal properties of dense matter, offering a computationally efficient solution that makes it particularly well-suited for the regimes relevant to neutron star binary remnants.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Hadronization -- A Study of In-Medium Hadronization of Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD jets are considered important probes for quark gluon plasma created in collisions of nuclei at high energies. Their parton showers are significantly altered if they develop inside of a deconfined medium. Hadronization of jets is also thought to be affected by the presence of quarks and gluons. We present a systematic study of the effects of a thermal bath of partons on the hadronization of parton showers. We use the JETSCAPE framework to create parton showers both in vacuum and in a brick of quark gluon plasma. The brick setup allows important parameters, like the size of the plasma as well as the collective flow of partons, to be varied systematically. We hadronize the parton showers using Hybrid Hadronization, which permits shower partons to form strings with thermal partons, or to recombine directly with thermal partons as well as with each other. We find a sizeable amount of interaction of shower partons with thermal partons during hadronization, indicating a natural continuation of the interaction of jet and medium during this stage. The observed effects grow with the size of the medium. Collective flow easily transfers from the thermal partons onto the emerging jet hadrons. We also see a significant change in hadron chemistry as expected in the presence of quark recombination processes.</description>

      <title>Polarized Dissociation and Spin Alignment of Moving Quarkonium in Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have found spin alignment of $J/\psi$ with respect to event plane in heavy ion collisions, suggesting a medium effect that is spin dependent. We propose a possible mechanism with polarized dissociation from the motion of $J/\psi$ with respect to the medium. We calculate polarized dissociation rate for quarkonium spin triplet state from spin chromomagnetic coupling in the potential non-relativistic QCD framework. This is done for the leading order gluo-dissociation process and next to leading order inelastic Coulomb scattering process. The polarized dissociation rate is expressed as a function of relative velocity between quarkonium and QGP and the quantization axis. Applying the polarized dissociation rate to quarkonium evolution with dissociation effect only in a Bjorken flow, we find the spin $0$ state to dissociate less than the other spin states, leading to positive $\rho_{00}-1/3$. Regeneration contribution is expected to give a contribution with the opposite sign.</description>

      <title>Confined Monopoles in Chiral Bag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral bag model provides a dual description of hadron physics in terms of quarks and hadrons in the sense of Cheshire Cat principle. In this work, we find that, within the chiral bag, confinement is likely caused by monopole condensation. The chiral bag surface can be interpreted as an $\eta'$ domain wall, where a Chern-Simons-Higgs theory resides, as previously conjectured. Under level-rank duality, the Chern-Simons theory corresponds to the counterterm introduced to block the so-called color charge leakage. To obtain the correct net baryon number for the total chiral bag, vector meson field interactions occur on the bag surface and extend outside the bag. We also propose that the skyrmion description of baryons should be understood as a system of monopoles enveloped by a meson cloud.</description>

      <title>Effect of nuclear medium on the spatial distribution of pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the valence quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the lightest pseudoscalar meson, pion, in an isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature by employing a light-cone quark model. The medium modifications in the unpolarized GPDs have been incorporated by taking inputs from the chiral SU($3$) quark mean field model. The electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) and charge radii have been calculated for both the vacuum and in-medium cases. These results are found to be in agreement with the available experimental data and other model predictions.</description>

      <title>Left-hand cut and the HAL QCD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the left-hand cut (LHC) problem is treated in the HAL QCD method. For this purpose, we first consider the effect of the LHC to the scattering problem in non-relativistic quantum mechanics with potentials. We show that the $S$-matrix or the scattering phase shift obtained from the potential including the Yukawa term ($e^{- m_\pi r}/r$) with the infra-red (IR) cutoff $R$ is well-defined even for the complex momentum $k$ as long as $R$ is finite, and they are compared with those obtained by the analytic continuation without the IR cutoff. In the $R\to\infty$ limit, the phase shift approaches the result from the analytic continuation at ${\rm Im}\, k &lt; m_\pi/2$, while they differ at ${\rm Im}\, k &gt; m_\pi/2$, except $k= k_b$, where $k_b$ is the binding momentum. We also observe that $k_b$ can be correctly obtained even at finite but large $R$. Using knowledge obtained in the non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we present how we should treat the LHC in the HAL QCD potential method.</description>

      <title>Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theories at non-zero temperature still holds fundamental open questions, in particular what happens to vacuum Goldstone bosons when the temperature is increased. By investigating a complex scalar field theory on the lattice we demonstrate that Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature behave like screened massless particle-like excitations, so-called thermoparticles, which continue to exist even in the symmetry-restored phase of the theory. We provide non-perturbative evidence for the functional form of the Goldstone mode's dissipative behaviour, which is distinct from standard perturbative expectations, and determine its corresponding spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Study of hybrid stars with nonstrange quark matter cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, under the hypothesis that quark matter may not be strange (Holdom et al. 2018), we adopt a modification of the coupling constant of the four-quark scalar interaction $G\rightarrow G_1+G_2\langle\bar{\psi}\psi\rangle$ in the 2-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model to study nonstrange hybrid stars, where $G_1$ and $G_2$ are two parameters constrained by using the lattice QCD simulation results at the critical temperature and zero chemical potential. The Maxwell construction is used to describe the first-order confinement-deconfinement phase transition in hybrid stars. With recent measurements on neutron star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, the hybrid equation of states are constrained. It is found that pure nonstrange quark matter cores can exist in hybrid stars, possessing $0.026-0.04$ solar mass. The maximum hybrid star mass in the framework of the modified NJL model is about 0.1 solar mass lighter than that in the conventional 2-flavor NJL model. It is argued that the binary neutron stars in GW170817 should be hadron stars.</description>

      <title>Subtleties in the calculation of correlation functions for hot and dense systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss subtleties in the calculation of loop integrals in studies of hot and dense systems as they appear in both perturbative and non-perturbative approaches. To be specific, we address subtleties which appear in situations where the order of integration, differentiation, and limit processes plays a crucial role. For example, this applies to computations of the effective action and the computation of momentum-dependent correlation functions. In particular, the zero-temperature limit is delicate in systems with fermions because of the presence of discontinuities at the Fermi surface. We provide a general discussion of scenarios where the computation and evaluation of loop integrals in the context of relativistic theories requires particular attention as a change of the order of the involved mathematical operations may lead to a different result. Our general considerations are then illustrated with the aid of concrete examples, namely by the computation of masses from fully momentum-dependent correlation functions in the context of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nature of charm degrees of freedom near the chiral crossover based on lattice QCD calculations of the second and fourth-order cumulants of charm fluctuations, and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations. We show that below the chiral crossover temperature, $T_{pc}$, the thermodynamics of charm can be very well understood in terms of charmed hadrons. We present evidence that above $T_{pc}$, however, charm quark-like excitations emerge as new degrees of freedom contributing to the partial charm pressure. Nonetheless, up to temperatures as high as 175 MeV, charmed hadron-like excitations significantly contribute to the partial charm pressure.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in a rigidly rotating relativistic boson gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a free Bose gas under rigid rotation. The aim is to explore the impact of rotation on the thermodynamic quantities associated with BEC, including the Bose-Einstein (BE) transition temperature and condensate fraction. We begin by introducing the rotation in the Lagrangian density of free charged Klein-Gordon fields and determine the corresponding grand canonical partition function at finite temperature, chemical potential, and finite angular velocity. Assuming slow rotation, we derive analytical expressions for the pressure, energy, number, and angular momentum densities of a free Bose gas in nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits in terms of the corresponding fugacities. We then focus on the phenomenon of BEC. We calculate the critical temperature of BEC transition and the condensate fraction in a slowly rotating Bose gas including only particles. Our findings indicate that the critical exponent associated with the BE transition in a rotating gas is lower compared to that in a nonrotating Bose gas. We also determine the fugacity in a rotating Bose gas in the aforementioned limits and examine how rotation affects its temperature dependence, both below and above the critical temperature. By analyzing the behavior of heat capacity at these temperatures, we demonstrate that in a nonrelativistic Bose gas, the rotation transforms the nature of the BE phase transition from a continuous to a discontinuous transition. In general, we find that a nonrelativistic Bose gas under rotation behaves similarly to a nonrotating Bose gas in ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Higher-order dissipative anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the method of moments to the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and derive the equations of motion for the irreducible moments of arbitrary tensor-rank of the invariant single-particle distribution function. We study two cases, in the first of which the moments are taken to be irreducible with respect to the little group associated with the time-like fluid four-velocity, while in the second case they are assumed to be also irreducible with respect to a space-like four-vector orthogonal to the fluid four-velocity, which breaks the spatial isotropy to a rotational symmetry in the plane transverse to this vector. A systematic truncation and closure of the general moment equations leads, in the first case, to a theory of relativistic higher-order dissipative resistive magnetohydrodynamics. In the second case, we obtain a novel theory of dissipative resistive anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics, where the momentum anisotropy is in principle independent from that introduced by the external magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>
