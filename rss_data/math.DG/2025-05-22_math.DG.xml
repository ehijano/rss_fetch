      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff limits of collapsing Calabi-Yau fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Calabi-Yau metrics on a projective manifold in K\"ahler classes converging to a semiample class given by a fibration. We show that the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the metrics is homeomorphic to the base of the fibration and in addition the discriminant locus has Hausdorff codimension at least 2. This resolves conjectures of Tosatti.</description>

      <title>Smooth atlas stratified spaces, K-Homology Orientations, and Gysin maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce smooth atlas stratified spaces. We show that this class is closed under cartesian products; consequently, it is possible to define fiber bundles of smooth atlas stratified spaces. We describe the resolution of such a space to a manifold with fibered corners and use this result in order to prove that the class of smooth atlas stratified spaces coincides with that of Thom-Mather stratified spaces.
  We then consider Witt pseudomanifolds (such as singular complex algebraic varieties) where it is well-known that a bordism invariant signature is available and equal to the Fredholm index of a realization of the signature operator. To each oriented fiber bundle of stratified spaces, with Witt fibers, we assign a class in bivariant KK-theory (with 2 inverted). Kasparov multiplication by this element defines a Gysin map in analytic K-homology and one of our main results is that this Gysin map preserves the analytic signature class of Witt spaces. We prove in fact a more general result: functoriality for fiber bundles in the sense that if one fiber bundle is the composition of two others then the KK-class of the former is the Kasparov product of the classes of the latter. We also discuss this result for other Dirac-type operators satisfying an analytic Witt condition, for example the spin-Dirac operator on a fibration of psc-Witt spin pseudomanifolds. We next define the analytic Gysin map associated to an oriented normally non-singular inclusion of Witt spaces and prove that it also preserves the signature class.
  Finally, we relate the analytic signature class of a Witt space with the topological Siegel-Sullivan orientation. Specifically we show that if one applies the inverse of the second Adams operation to the Sullivan orientation and complexifies then one obtains our analytic signature class under the natural identification between analytic and topological K-homology.</description>

      <title>Every nonflat conformal minimal surface is homotopic to a proper one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an open Riemann surface $M$, we prove that every nonflat conformal minimal immersion $M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 3$) is homotopic through nonflat conformal minimal immersions $M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ to a proper one. If $n\geq 5$, it may be chosen in addition injective, hence a proper conformal minimal embedding. Prescribing its flux, as a consequence, every nonflat conformal minimal immersion $M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is homotopic to the real part of a proper holomorphic null embedding $M\to\mathbb{C}^n$. We also obtain a result for a more general family of holomorphic immersions from an open Riemann surface into $\mathbb{C}^n$ directed by Oka cones in $\mathbb{C}^n$.</description>

      <title>Conformal extremal metrics and constant scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact complex manifold of dimension $n\geq 2$. We prove that for any Hermitian metric $\omega$ on $M$, there exists a unique smooth function $f$ (up to additive constants) such that the conformal metric $\omega_g =e^f \omega$ solves the fourth-order nonlinear PDE
  $$\square_g^*(s_g|s_g|^{n-2})=0,$$
  where $s_g$ is the Chern scalar curvature of $\omega_g$, and $\square_g^*$ denotes the formal adjoint of the complex Laplacian $\square_g=\mathrm{tr}_{\omega_g}\sqrt{-1}\partial\bar\partial$ with respect to $\omega_g$. This equation arises as the Euler-Lagrange equation of the $n$-Calabi functional
  $$C_{n}(\omega_g)=\int |s_g|^n\frac{\omega_g^n}{n!}$$ within the conformal class of $\omega_g$. Moreover, we show that the critical metric $\omega_g$ minimizes the $n$-Calabi functional within the conformal class $[\omega]$. In particular,
  if $\omega_g$ is a Gauduchon metric, then $\omega_g$ has constant Chern scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Riemannian and Lorentzian Calder\'on problem under Magnetic Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study both the Riemannian and Lorentzian Calder\'on problem when a family of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps are given for an open set of magnetic/electromagnetic potentials. For the Riemannian version, by allowing small perturbations of the magnetic potential, we use the Runge Approximation Theorem to show that the metric can be uniquely determined. There is no gauge equivalence in this case. For the Lorentzian version, we use microlocal analysis to construct the trajectory of null-geodesics via generic perturbations of the electromagnetic potential, hence the conformal class of the metric can be constructed. Moreover, we also show, in the Lorentzian case, the same result can be obtained using generic perturbations of the metric itself.</description>

      <title>Piecewise-linear Ricci curvature flows on weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is an important problem in graph neural networks. Recently, algorithms based on Ricci curvature flows have gained significant attention. It was suggested by Ollivier (2009), and applied to community detection by Ni et al (2019) and Lai et al (2022). Its mathematical theory was due to Bai et al (2024) and Li-M\"unch (2025). In particular, solutions to some of these flows have existence, uniqueness and convergence. However, a unified theoretical framework has not yet been established in this field.
  In the current study, we propose several unified piecewise-linear Ricci curvature flows with respect to arbitrarily selected Ricci curvatures. First, we prove that the flows have global existence and uniqueness. Second, we show that if the Ricci curvature being used is homogeneous, then after undergoing multiple surgeries, the evolving graph has a constant Ricci curvature on each connected component. Note that five commonly used Ricci curvatures, which were respectively defined by Ollivier, Lin-Lu-Yau, Forman, Menger and Haantjes, are all homogeneous, and that the proof of all these results is independent of the choice of the specific Ricci curvature. Third, as an application, we apply the discrete piecewise-linear Ricci curvature flow with surgeries to the problem of community detection. On three real-world datasets, the flow consistently outperforms baseline models and existing methods. Complementary experiments on synthetic graphs further confirm its scalability and robustness. Compared with existing algorithms, our algorithm has two advantages: it does not require curvature calculations at each iteration, and the iterative process converges.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Contraction Mappings to The Complement of Closed Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some analytic properties of distance decreasing self-maps onto the complement of a smooth curve $\Sigma$ in $S^n$. For $n&gt;4$ and $n\equiv 0 \mod 4$, let $\Sigma$ be an embedded circle in $S^n$ and let $g$ be a complete Riemannian metric on $X=S^n\backslash \Sigma$ and $f:(X,g)\to (X,g_{std})$ be a 1-contracting diffeomorphism. We verify the sharp estimate $\inf_{x\in X}Sc(g)_x&lt;n(n-1)$ if any real Lipschitz 2-chain $C$ which represents the unit element $[C]$ in $H_2(S^n, W(\Sigma); \mathbb{R})$ satisfies $Area_g(C)&gt;C(n)\cdot \max_i\{|\theta_i|\}$ where $W(\Sigma)$ is any tubular neighborhood of $\Sigma$ and $\{e^{2\pi i\theta_i}\}_i$ are the holonomy parameters along $\iota^*S^+$ where $S^+$ is the positive spinor bundle over $S^n$. This answers a question in \cite{gromov2018metric}.</description>

      <title>Butcher series for Hamiltonian Poisson integrators through symplectic groupoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit a new pre-Lie algebra in the framework of symplectic groupoids and, in turn, introduce a pre-Lie formalism of Butcher trees for the approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi solutions on any symplectic groupoid $\mathcal{G} \rightrightarrows M.$ The impact of this new algebraic approach is twofold. On the geometric side, it yields algebraic operations to approximate Lagrangian bisections of $\mathcal{G}$ using the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and, in turn, aims at a better understanding of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $M.$ On the computational side, we define a new class of Poisson integrators for Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider numerical characteristics of the connected compact Riemannian manifold (M, g) such as the supremum and infimum of the scalar curvature s, Ricci curvature Ric and sectional curvature sec, as well as their applications. Below are two examples of proven results. The first statement: If (M, g) be a connected, compact Riemannian manifold of even dimension n &gt; 3 whose Ricci and sectional curvatures satisfy the strict inequality n Inf (sec) &gt; Sup (Ric), then M is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean n-dimensional sphere of some radius r or the real projective n-dimensional space. The second statement: There is no harmonic immersion of an n-dimensional connected, complete Riemannian manifold (M, g) into the Euclidean n-sphere of radius r if there exists inf(Ric) such that Inf (Ric) &gt; n/2r^2.</description>

      <title>Nakai-Moishezon criteria and the toric Thomas-Yau conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of Lagrangian sections $L$ contained in certain Calabi-Yau Lagrangian fibrations (mirrors of toric weak Fano manifolds). We prove that a form of the Thomas-Yau conjecture holds in this case: $L$ is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian section in this class if and only if a stability condition holds, in the sense of a slope inequality on objects in a set of exact triangles in the Fukaya-Seidel category. This agrees with general proposals by Li. We use the SYZ transform, the toric gamma theorem, and toric homological mirror symmetry in order to reduce the statement to one about supercritical deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections, known as the Nakai-Moishezon criterion. As an application, we prove that, on the mirror of a toric weak del Pezzo surface, if $L$ defines a Bridgeland stable object in the Fukaya-Seidel category in a natural sense, then it is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian section in the class. The converse also holds for the mirror of the projective plane blown-up at one or two points, and always holds assuming a conjecture of Arcara and Miles. When $L$ is Bridgeland unstable, we obtain a morphism from $L$ to a weak solution of the special Lagrangian equation with phase angle satisfying a minimality condition. These results are consistent with general conjectures due to Joyce. We discuss some generalisations, including a weaker analogue of our main result for general projective toric manifolds, and a similar obstruction, related to Lagrangian multi-sections, in a special case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quantization on Riemannian manifolds via covering growth estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization problem looks for best approximations of a probability measure on a given metric space by finitely many points, where the approximation error is measured with respect to the Wasserstein distance. On particular smooth domains, such as $\mathbb{R}^d$ or complete Riemannian manifolds, the quantization error is known to decay polynomially as the number of points is taken to infinity, provided the measure satisfies an integral condition which controls the amount of mass outside compact sets. On Riemannian manifolds, the existing integral condition involves a quantity measuring the growth of the exponential map, for which the only available estimates are in terms of lower bounds on sectional curvature.
  In this paper, we provide a more general integral condition for the asymptotics of the quantization error on Riemannian manifolds, given in terms of the growth of the covering numbers of spheres, which is purely metric in nature and concerns only the large-scale growth of the manifold. We further estimate the covering growth of manifolds in two particular cases, namely lower bounds on the Ricci curvature and geometric group actions by a discrete group of isometries. These estimates can themselves generalize beyond manifolds, and hint at a future treatment of asymptotic quantization also on non-smooth metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>The free elastic flow for closed planar curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free elastic flow is the $L^2$-gradient flow for Euler's elastic energy, or equivalently the Willmore flow with translation invariant initial data. In contrast to elastic flows under length penalisation or preservation, it is more challenging to study the free elastic flow's asymptotic behavior, and convergence for closed curves is lost. In this paper, we nevertheless determine the asymptotic shape of the flow for initial curves that are geometrically close to circles, possibly multiply-covered, proving that an appropriate rescaling smoothly converges to a unique round circle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Boothby-Wang fibration to construct certain simply connected K-contact manifolds and we give sufficient and necessary conditions on when such K-contact manifolds are homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres. If the symplectic base manifold of the fibration admits a Hamiltonian torus action, we show that on the total space of the fibration, other than the regular K-contact structures which have infinitely many closed Reeb orbits, there are K-contact structures whose closed Reeb orbits correspond exactly to the fixed points of the Hamiltonian torus action on the base manifold. Then we give a collection of examples of compact simply connected K-contact manifolds with minimal number of closed Reeb orbits which are not homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres, while having the real cohomology ring of the spheres. Finally, we give a family of examples of simply connected K-contact manifolds which have one more than the minimal number of closed Reeb orbits and which do not have the real cohomology ring of the spheres.</description>

Abstract: We employ the curve shortening flow to establish three new results on the dynamics of geodesic flows of closed Riemannian surfaces. The first one is the stability, under $C^0$-small perturbations of the Riemannian metric, of certain flat links of closed geodesics. The second one is a forced existence theorem for closed connected orientable Riemannian surfaces: for surfaces of positive genus, the existence of a contractible simple closed geodesic $\gamma$ forces the existence of infinitely many closed geodesics intersecting $\gamma$ in every primitive free homotopy class of loops; for the 2-sphere, the existence of two disjoint simple closed geodesics forces the existence of a third one intersecting both. The final result asserts the existence of Birkhoff sections for the geodesic flow of any closed connected orientable Riemannian surface.</description>
