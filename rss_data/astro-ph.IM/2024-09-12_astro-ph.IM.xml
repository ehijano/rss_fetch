      <title>Wave effect of gravitational waves intersected with a microlens field II: an adaptive hierarchical tree algorithm and population study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing wave effect generated by a microlensing field embedded in a lens galaxy is an inevitable phenomenon in strong lensed gravitational waves (SLGWs). This effect presents both challenges and opportunities for the detection and application of SLGWs. However, investigating this wave effect requires computing a complete diffraction integral over each microlens in the field. This is extremely time-consuming due to the large number of microlenses. Therefore, simply adding all the microlenses is impractical. Additionally, the complexity of the time delay surface makes the lens plane resolution a crucial factor in controlling numerical errors. In this paper, we propose a trapezoid approximation-based adaptive hierarchical tree algorithm to meet the challenges of calculation speed and precision. We find that this algorithm accelerates the calculation by four orders of magnitude compared to the simple adding method and is one order of magnitude faster than the fixed hierarchical tree algorithm proposed for electromagnetic microlensing. More importantly, our algorithm ensures controllable numerical errors, increasing confidence in the results. Together with our previous work, this paper addresses all numerical issues, including integral convergence, precision, and computational time. Finally, we conducted a population study on the microlensing wave effect of SLGWs using this algorithm and found that the microlensing wave effect cannot be ignored, especially for Type II SLGWs due to their intrinsic geometric structures and their typical intersection with a denser microlensing field. Statistically, more than 33% (11%) of SLGWs have a mismatch larger than 1% (3%) compared to the unlensed waveform. Additionally, we found that the mismatch between signal pairs in a doubly imaged GW is generally larger than 10^{-3}, and 61% (25%) of signal pairs have a mismatch larger than 1% (3%).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) is a proposed dual-satellite mission to observe Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), increasing the statistics at the highest energies, and Very-High-Energy Neutrinos (VHENs), following multi-messenger alerts of astrophysical transient events throughout the universe such as gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a scaled-down version of the POEMMA design, adapted to be flown as a payload on one of NASA's sub-orbital Super Pressure Balloons (SPBs) circling over the Southern Ocean for up to 100 days after a launch from Wanaka, New Zealand. This overview will provide a summary of the mission with its science goals, the instruments, and the current status of PBR.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy using a visible photonic lantern at the Subaru telescope: Laboratory characterization and first on-sky demonstration on Ikiiki ({\alpha} Leo) and `Aua ({\alpha} Ori)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic lanterns are waveguide devices enabling high throughput single mode spectroscopy and high angular resolution. We aim to present the first on-sky demonstration of a photonic lantern (PL) operating in visible light, to measure its throughput and assess its potential for high-resolution spectroscopy of compact objects. We used the SCExAO instrument (a double stage extreme AO system installed at the Subaru telescope) and FIRST mid-resolution spectrograph (R 3000) to test the visible capabilities of the PL on internal source and on-sky observations. The best averaged coupling efficiency over the PL field of view was measured at 51% +/- 10% with a peak at 80%. We also investigate the relationship between coupling efficiency and the Strehl ratio for a PL, comparing them with those of a single-mode fiber (SMF). Findings show that in the AO regime, a PL offers better coupling efficiency performance than a SMF, especially in the presence of low spatial frequency aberrations. We observed Ikiiki (alpha Leo - mR = 1.37) and `Aua (alpha Ori - mR = -1.17) at a frame rate of 200 Hz. Under median seeing conditions (about 1 arcsec measured in H band) and large tip/tilt residuals (over 20 mas), we estimated an average light coupling efficiency of 14.5% +/- 7.4%, with a maximum of 42.8% at 680 nm. We were able to reconstruct both star's spectra, containing various absorption lines. The successful demonstration of this device opens new possibilities in terms of high throughput single-mode fiber-fed spectroscopy in the Visible. The demonstrated on-sky coupling efficiency performance would not have been achievable with a single SMF injection setup under similar conditions, partly because the residual tip/tilt alone exceeded the field of view of a visible SMF (18 mas at 700 nm). Thus emphasizing the enhanced resilience of PL technology to such atmospheric disturbances. The additional</description>

      <title>The Blending ToolKit: A simulation framework for evaluation of galaxy detection and deblending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open source Python library for simulating overlapping (i.e., blended) images of galaxies and performing self-consistent comparisons of detection and deblending algorithms based on a suite of metrics. The package, named Blending Toolkit (BTK), serves as a modular, flexible, easy-to-install, and simple-to-use interface for exploring and analyzing systematic effects related to blended galaxies in cosmological surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). BTK has three main components: (1) a set of modules that perform fast image simulations of blended galaxies, using the open source image simulation package GalSim; (2) a module that standardizes the inputs and outputs of existing deblending algorithms; (3) a library of deblending metrics commonly defined in the galaxy deblending literature. In combination, these modules allow researchers to explore the impacts of galaxy blending in cosmological surveys. Additionally, BTK provides researchers who are developing a new deblending algorithm a framework to evaluate algorithm performance and make principled comparisons with existing deblenders. BTK includes a suite of tutorials and comprehensive documentation. The source code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/BlendingToolKit.</description>

      <title>A Geodetic and Astrometric VLBI Experiment at 22/43/88/132 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending geodetic and astrometric Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations from traditional centimeter wavebands to millimeter wavebands offers numerous scientific potentials and benefits. However, it was considered quite challenging due to various factors, including the increased effects of atmospheric opacity and turbulence at millimeter wavelengths. Here, we present the results of the first geodetic-mode VLBI experiment, simultaneously observing 82 sources at 22/43/88/132 GHz (K/Q/W/D bands) using the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). We introduced the frequency phase transfer (FPT) method to geodetic VLBI analysis, an approach for calibrating atmospheric phase fluctuations at higher frequencies by transferring phase solutions from lower frequencies. With a 2-minute scan, FPT improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of most fringes, some by over 100%, thereby enhancing the detection rate of weak sources at millimeter wavebands. Additionally, FPT reduced systematic errors in group delay and delay rate, with the weighted root-mean-squares (WRMS) of the post-fitting residuals decreasing from 25.0 ps to 20.5 ps at the W band and from 39.3 ps to 27.6 ps at the D band. There were no notable differences observed in calibrating atmospheric phase fluctuations at the K band (WRMS = 12.4 ps) and Q band (WRMS = 11.8 ps) with the KVN baselines. This experiment demonstrated that the millimeter waveband can be used for geodetic and astrometric applications with high precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic charged particle beam can be used as destructive beam weapons in space for debris removal tasks. The trajectories of charged particles are affected by both electric and magnetic forces in the Earth's magnetic field. In this paper, we firstly analyzed the correlation parameters of the charged particle beam as a weapon when it propagated in the geomagnetic field. Then the models were constructed based on COMSOL Multiphysics and the IGRF model was adopted in the simulation. The gyro-radius and the related uncertainty were analyzed by simulation of the charged particle transport in the geomagnetic field at different altitudes. The charged beam spot radius divergency was also simulated. The magnetic field pinch effect can be found and can limit the beam spreading.</description>

      <title>Design, scientific goals, and performance of the SCExAO survey for planets around accelerating stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the motivation, design, and early results for our 42-night, 125 star Subaru/SCExAO direct imaging survey for planets around accelerating stars. Unlike prior large surveys, ours focuses only on stars showing evidence for an astrometric acceleration plausibly due to the dynamical pull of an unseen planet or brown dwarf. Our program is motivated by results from a recent pilot program that found the first planet jointly discovered from direct imaging and astrometry and resulted in a planet and brown dwarf discovery rate substantially higher than previous unbiased surveys like GPIES. The first preliminary results from our program reveal multiple new companions; discovered planets and brown dwarfs can be further characterized with follow-up data, including higher-resolution spectra. Finally, we describe the critical role this program plays in supporting the Roman Space Telescope Coronagraphic Instrument, providing a currently-missing list of targets suitable for the CGI technological demonstration without which the CGI tech demo risks failure.</description>

      <title>Implementation of thermal conduction energy transfer models in the Bifrost Solar atmosphere MHD code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Thermal conductivity provides important contributions to the energy evolution of the upper solar atmosphere, behaving as a non-linear concentration-dependent diffusion equation. Recently, different methods have been offered as best-fit solutions to these problems in specific situations, but their effectiveness and limitations are rarely discussed. Aims. We rigorously test the different implementations of solving the conductivity flux, in the massively-parallel magnetohydrodynamics code, Bifrost, with the aim of specifying the best scenarios for the use of each method. Methods: We compare the differences and limitations of explicit versus implicit methods, and analyse the convergence of a hyperbolic approximation. Among the tests, we use a newly derived 1st-order self-similar approximation to compare the efficacy of each method analytically in a 1D pure-thermal test scenario. Results: We find that although the hyperbolic approximation proves the most accurate and the fastest to compute in long-running simulations, there is no optimal method to calculate the mid-term conductivity with both accuracy and efficiency. We also find that the solution of this approximation is sensitive to the initial conditions, and can lead to faster convergence if used correctly. Hyper-diffusivity is particularly useful in aiding the methods to perform optimally. Conclusions: We discuss recommendations for the use of each method within more complex simulations, whilst acknowledging the areas of opportunity for new methods to be developed.</description>

      <title>ALMACAL XII. Data characterisation and products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALMACAL survey is based on a database of reprocessed ALMA calibration scans suitable for scientific analysis, observed as part of regular PI observations. We present all the data accumulated from the start of ALMA operations until May 2022 for 1047 calibrator fields across the southern sky spanning ALMA Bands 3 to 10 (~ 84 - 950 GHz), so-called ALMACAL-22. Encompassing over 1000 square arcmin and accumulating over 2000 hours of integration time, ALMACAL is not only one of the largest ALMA surveys to date, but it continues to grow with each new scientific observation. We outline the methods for processing and imaging a subset of the highest-quality data ('pruned sample'). Using deconvolution techniques within the visibility data (uv plane), we created data cubes as the final product for further scientific analysis. We describe the properties and shortcomings of ALMACAL and compare its area and sensitivity with other sub-millimetre surveys. Notably, ALMACAL overcomes limitations of previous sub-millimetre surveys, such as small sky coverage and the effects of cosmic variance. Moreover, we discuss the improvements introduced by the latest version of this dataset that will enhance our understanding of dusty star-forming galaxies, extragalactic absorption lines, active galactic nucleus physics, and ultimately the evolution of molecular gas.</description>

      <title>Measuring Sub-Kelvin Variations in Stellar Temperature with High-Resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of stellar variability often relies on the measurement of selected activity indicators such as coronal emission lines and non-thermal emissions. On the flip side, the effective stellar temperature is normally seen as one of the key fundamental parameters (with mass and radius) to understanding the basic physical nature of a star and its relation with its environment (e.g., planetary instellation). We present a novel approach for measuring disk-averaged temperature variations to sub-Kelvin accuracy inspired by algorithms developed for precision radial velocity. This framework uses the entire content of the spectrum, not just pre-identified lines, and can be applied to existing data obtained with high-resolution spectrographs. We demonstrate the framework by recovering the known rotation periods and temperature modulation of Barnard star and AU Mic in datasets obtained in the infrared with SPIRou at CHFT and at optical wavelengths on $\epsilon$ Eridani with HARPS at ESO 3.6-m telescope. We use observations of the transiting hot Jupiter HD189733\,b, obtained with SPIRou, to show that this method can unveil the minute temperature variation signature expected during the transit event, an effect analogous to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect but in temperature space. This method is a powerful new tool for characterizing stellar activity, and in particular temperature and magnetic features at the surfaces of cool stars, affecting both precision radial velocity and transit spectroscopic observations. We demonstrate the method in the context of high-resolution spectroscopy but the method could be used at lower resolution.</description>

      <title>Detectability Simulations of a NIR Surface Biosignature on Proxima Centauri b with Future Space Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telescope missions are currently being designed which will make direct imaging of habitable exoplanets possible in the near future, and studies are needed to quantify the detectability of biosignature features in the planet's reflectance spectrum. We simulated the detectability of a NIR-absorbing surface biosignature feature with simulated observations of the nearby exoplanet Proxima Centauri b. We modeled a biosignature spectral feature with a reflectance spectrum based on an anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterial species that has strong absorption at 1 um, which could make it well suited for life on an M-dwarf hosted planet. We modeled the distribution of this organism across the planet's surface based on climate states from a 3D General Circulation Model (GCM), which were Archean and Proterozoic-like exo-Earth analogues. We included the GCM runs' prognostically simulated water clouds and added organic haze into the Archean-like atmospheres. We simulated observations of these Proxima Centauri b scenarios with the LUVOIR-A and B telescope concepts, with LUVOIR-B serving as a proxy to the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We calculated integration times necessary to detect the biosignature, and found that it would be detectable on Proxima Centauri b if the organism is moderately abundant (greater than a 1-4% global surface area coverage), as long as the atmosphere is transmitting in the wavelength range under consideration. Small amounts of methane, clouds, and haze do not greatly impede detectability. We found preliminary evidence that such a biosignature would be detectable on exoplanets within 15 pc, but further investigations are needed to corroborate this.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Inference of Reionization Parameters from 3D Tomographic 21 cm Light-cone Images -- II: Application of Solid Harmonic Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information regarding how the intergalactic medium is reionized by astrophysical sources is contained in the tomographic three-dimensional 21 cm images from the epoch of reionization. In Zhao et al. (2022a) ("Paper I"), we demonstrated for the first time that density estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) can be applied efficiently to perform a Bayesian inference of the reionization parameters from the 21 cm images. Nevertheless, the 3D image data needs to be compressed into informative summaries as the input of DELFI by, e.g., a trained 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) as in Paper I (DELFI-3D CNN). Here in this paper, we introduce an alternative data compressor, the solid harmonic wavelet scattering transform (WST), which has a similar, yet fixed (i.e. no training), architecture to CNN, but we show that this approach (i.e. solid harmonic WST with DELFI) outperforms earlier analyses based on 3D 21 cm images using DELFI-3D CNN in terms of credible regions of parameters. Realistic effects, including thermal noise and residual foreground after removal, are also applied to the mock observations from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We show that under the same inference strategy using DELFI, the 21 cm image analysis with solid harmonic WST outperforms the 21 cm power spectrum analysis. This research serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential to harness the strengths of WST and simulation-based inference to derive insights from future 21 cm light-cone image data.</description>
