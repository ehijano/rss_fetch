      <title>The exact travelling wave solutions of a KPP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation with the reaction term belonging to the class of functions, which includes that of the (generalized) Fisher equation, for the particular values of the waves speed. The solutions are written in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Edge-based Modeling for Disease Transmission on Random Graphs: An Application to Mitigate a Syphilis Outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge-based network models, especially those based on bond percolation methods, can be used to model disease transmission on complex networks and accommodate social heterogeneity while keeping tractability. Here we present an application of an edge-based network model to the spread of syphilis in the Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox &amp; Addington (KFL&amp;A) region of Southeastern Ontario, Canada. We compared the results of using a network-based susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model to those generated from using a traditional mass action SIR model. We found that the network model yields very different predictions, including a much lower estimate of the final epidemic size. We also used the network model to estimate the potential impact of introducing a rapid syphilis point of care test (POCT) and treatment intervention strategy that has recently been implemented by the public health unit to mitigate syphilis transmission.</description>

      <title>Inner ear morphology in wild versus laboratory house mice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semicircular canals of the inner ear are involved in balance and velocity control. Being crucial to ensure efficient mobility, their morphology exhibits an evolutionary conservatism attributed to stabilizing selection. Release of selection in slow-moving animals has been argued to lead to morphological divergence and increased inter-individual variation. In its natural habitat, the house mouse Mus musculus moves in a tridimensional space where efficient balance is required. In contrast, laboratory mice in standard cages are severely restricted in their ability to move, which possibly reduces selection on the inner ear morphology. This effect was tested by comparing four groups of mice: several populations of wild mice trapped in commensal habitats in France; their second-generation laboratory offspring, to assess plastic effects related to breeding conditions; a standard laboratory strain (Swiss) that evolved for many generations in a regime of mobility reduction; and hybrids between wild offspring and Swiss mice. The morphology of the semicircular canals was quantified using a set of 3D landmarks and semi-landmarks analyzed using geometric morphometric protocols. Levels of inter-population, inter-individual (disparity) and intra-individual (asymmetry) variation were compared. All wild mice shared a similar inner ear morphology, in contrast to the important divergence of the Swiss strain. The release of selection in the laboratory strain obviously allowed for an important and rapid drift in the otherwise conserved structure. Shared traits between the inner ear of the lab strain and domestic pigs suggested a common response to mobility reduction in captivity. The lab-bred offspring of wild mice also differed from their wild relatives, suggesting plastic response related to maternal locomotory behavior, since inner ear morphology matures before birth in mammals. The signature observed in lab-bred wild mice and the lab strain was however not congruent, suggesting that plasticity did not participate to the divergence of the laboratory strain. However, contrary to the expectation, wild mice displayed slightly higher levels of inter-individual variation than laboratory mice, possibly due to the higher levels of genetic variance within and among wild populations compared to the lab strain. Differences in fluctuating asymmetry levels were detected, with the laboratory strain occasionally displaying higher asymmetry scores than its wild relatives. This suggests that there may indeed be a release of selection and/or a decrease in developmental stability in the laboratory strain.</description>

      <title>Mathematically tractable models of random phylogenetic networks: an overview of some recent developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of random phylogenetic networks have been used since the inception of the field, but the introduction and rigorous study of mathematically tractable models is a much more recent topic that has gained momentum in the last 5~years. This manuscript discusses some recent developments in the field through a selection of examples. The emphasis is on the techniques rather than on the results themselves, and on probabilistic tools rather than on combinatorial ones.</description>

      <title>Opinion-driven risk perception and reaction in SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze a mathematical model to study the feedback between behavior and epidemic spread in a population that is actively assessing and reacting to risk of infection. In our model, a population dynamically forms an opinion that reflects its willingness to engage in risky behavior (e.g., not wearing a mask in a crowded area) or reduce it (e.g., social distancing). We consider SIS epidemic dynamics in which the contact rate within a population adapts as a function of its opinion. For the new coupled model, we prove the existence of two distinct parameter regimes. One regime corresponds to a low baseline infectiousness, and the equilibria of the epidemic spread are identical to those of the standard SIS model. The other regime corresponds to a high baseline infectiousness, and there is a bistability between two new endemic equilibria that reflect an initial preference towards either risk seeking behavior or risk aversion. We prove that risk seeking behavior increases the steady-state infection level in the population compared to the baseline SIS model, whereas risk aversion decreases it. When a population is highly reactive to extreme opinions, we show how risk aversion enables the complete eradication of infection in the population. Extensions of the model to a network of populations or individuals are explored numerically.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Large Deviation Principle for Hawkes Processes on sparse large disordered networks with a graphon structure. We apply our results to a stochastic SIS epidemiological model on a disordered networks, and determine Euler-Lagrange equations that dictate the most likely transition path between different states of the network.</description>

      <title>Active risk aversion in SIS epidemics on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze an actively controlled Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (actSIS) model of interconnected populations to study how risk aversion strategies, such as social distancing, affect network epidemics. A population using a risk aversion strategy reduces its contact rate with other populations when it perceives an increase in infection risk. The network actSIS model relies on two distinct networks. One is a physical contact network that defines which populations come into contact with which other populations and thus how infection spreads. The other is a communication network, such as an online social network, that defines which populations observe the infection level of which other populations and thus how information spreads. We prove that the model, with these two networks and populations using risk aversion strategies, exhibits a transcritical bifurcation in which an endemic equilibrium emerges. For regular graphs, we prove that the endemic infection level is uniform across populations and reduced by the risk aversion strategy, relative to the network SIS endemic level. We show that when communication is sufficiently sparse, this initially stable equilibrium loses stability in a secondary bifurcation. Simulations show that a new stable solution emerges with nonuniform infection levels.</description>
