      <title>Optimal Cash Transfers and Microinsurance to Reduce Social Protection Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design and implementation of appropriate social protection strategies is one of the main targets of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1: No Poverty. Cash transfer (CT) programmes are considered one of the main social protection strategies and an instrument for achieving SDG 1. Targeting consists of establishing eligibility criteria for beneficiaries of CT programmes. In low-income countries, where resources are limited, proper targeting of CTs is essential for an efficient use of resources. Given the growing importance of microinsurance as a complementary tool to social protection strategies, this study examines its role as a supplement to CT programmes. In this article, we adopt the piecewise-deterministic Markov process introduced in Kovacevic and Pflug (2011) to model the capital of a household, which when exposed to large proportional capital losses (in contrast to the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg model) can push them into the poverty area. Striving for cost-effective CT programmes, we optimise the expected discounted cost of keeping the household's capital above the poverty line by means of injection of capital (as a direct capital transfer). Using dynamic programming techniques, we derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the optimal control problem of determining the amount of capital to inject over time. We show that this equation admits a viscosity solution that can be approximated numerically. Moreover, in certain special cases, we obtain closed-form expressions for the solution. Numerical examples show that there is an optimal level of injection above the poverty threshold, suggesting that efficient use of resources is achieved when CTs are preventive rather than reactive, since injecting capital into households when their capital levels are above the poverty line is less costly than to do so only when it falls below the threshold.</description>

      <title>Levy-stable scaling of risk and performance functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a finite-horizon model in which liquid-asset returns exhibit Levy-stable scaling on a data-driven window [tau_UV, tau_IR] and aggregate into a finite-variance regime outside. The window and the tail index alpha are identified from the log-log slope of the central body and a two-segment fit of scale versus horizon. With an anchor horizon tau_0, we derive horizon-correct formulas for Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall, Sharpe and Information ratios, Kelly under a Value-at-Risk constraint, and one-step drawdown, where each admits a closed-form Gaussian-bias term driven by the exponent gap (1/alpha - 1/2). The implementation is nonparametric up to alpha and fixed tail quantiles. The formulas are reproducible across horizons on the Levy window.</description>

      <title>Forecast-to-Fill: Benchmark-Neutral Alpha and Billion-Dollar Capacity in Gold Futures (2015-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test whether simple, interpretable state variables-trend and momentum-can generate durable out-of-sample alpha in one of the world's most liquid assets, gold. Using a rolling 10-year training and 6-month testing walk-forward from 2015 to 2025 (2,793 trading days), we convert a smoothed trend-momentum regime signal into volatility-targeted, friction-aware positions through fractional, impact-adjusted Kelly sizing and ATR-based exits. Out of sample, the strategy delivers a Sharpe ratio of 2.88 and a maximum drawdown of 0.52 percent, net of 0.7 basis-point linear cost and a square-root impact term (gamma = 0.02). A regression on spot-gold returns yields a 43 percent annualized return (CAGR approximately 43 percent) and a 37 percent alpha (Sharpe = 2.88, IR = 2.09) at a 15 percent volatility target with beta approximately 0.03, confirming benchmark-neutral performance. Bootstrap confidence intervals ([2.49, 3.27]) and SPA tests (p = 0.000) confirm statistical significance and robustness to latency, reversal, and cost stress. We conclude that forecast-to-fill engineering-linking transparent signals to executable trades with explicit risk, cost, and impact control-can transform modest predictability into allocator-grade, billion-dollar-scalable alpha.</description>
