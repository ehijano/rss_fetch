      <title>Analyzing New Planetary Systems at School: Applications of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and Kepler's Third Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As scientific knowledge expands, science education may not always keep pace with the latest advancements in astrophysics. A solid scientific education is crucial for preparing students for 21st-century challenges. However, science education often focuses narrowly on specific content, neglecting frontier scientific research. To address this, a teaching sequence was developed in Chile using real exoplanet data from the Open Exoplanet Catalog and NASA's Eye on Exoplanets webpage. This integrates cutting-edge astrophysical concepts into classroom discussions. Analyzing this data prompts students to discuss how Newton's law of universal gravitation and Kepler's third law apply to current research on extrasolar systems. This sequence deepens understanding of these principles within modern astrophysics, enriching science education. Such activities spark new research questions akin to those debated in scientific circles, enhancing insights into planetary formation.</description>

      <title>From Novice to Expert in Cloud Physics: a Graph-Based Analysis of Learner Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how learners conceptualise complex scientific systems remains a key challenge in geoscience education. We investigate the evolution of conceptual understanding of cloud physics among 153 learners, ranging from bachelor students to disciplinary experts and representing diverse academic backgrounds across STEM. To do so, we trace how knowledge structures evolve over time using metrics from a cross-sectional network analysis. The analysis characterises the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the epistemological shift that learners experience as they mature in their understanding of the discipline. We show that in their description of the life-cycle of a cloud, they progressively transition from the general physics of the water cycle to detailed descriptions of cloud microphysical processes. A triangulation of data sources with a panel of experts complements and confirms the analysis. The results can assist lecturers in structuring their teaching towards higher levels of understanding and enable students to anticipate the key complexities and conceptual challenges in the field during their learning process. Furthermore, the generic nature of the analysis can be transferred to a wide range of disciplines.</description>
