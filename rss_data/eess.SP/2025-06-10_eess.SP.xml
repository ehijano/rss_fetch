      <title>Benchmarking Early Agitation Prediction in Community-Dwelling People with Dementia Using Multimodal Sensors and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia, comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp. Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720 and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in place.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Novel Ensemble Learning Techniques and Landsat Multispectral Data for Estimating Olive Yields in Tunisia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Olive production is an important tree crop in Mediterranean climates. However, olive yield varies significantly due to climate change. Accurately estimating yield using remote sensing and machine learning remains a complex challenge. In this study, we developed a streamlined pipeline for olive yield estimation in the Kairouan and Sousse governorates of Tunisia. We extracted features from multispectral reflectance bands, vegetation indices derived from Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-9 OLI-2 satellite imagery, along with digital elevation model data. These spatial features were combined with ground-based field survey data to form a structured tabular dataset. We then developed an automated ensemble learning framework, implemented using AutoGluon to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, select optimal combinations through stacking, and generate robust yield predictions using five-fold cross-validation. The results demonstrate strong predictive performance from both sensors, with Landsat-8 OLI achieving R2 = 0.8635 and RMSE = 1.17 tons per ha, and Landsat-9 OLI-2 achieving R2 = 0.8378 and RMSE = 1.32 tons per ha. This study highlights a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate method for olive yield estimation, with potential applicability across diverse agricultural regions globally.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Contrastive Learning-based Electrocardiogram Pretrained Model with Patient Memory Queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of automatic Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, due to the relatively limited amount of labeled data, how to build a robust ECG pretrained model based on unlabeled data is a key area of focus for researchers. Recent advancements in contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained models highlight the potential of exploiting the additional patient-level self-supervisory signals inherent in ECG. They are referred to as patient contrastive learning. Its rationale is that multiple physical recordings from the same patient may share commonalities, termed patient consistency, so redefining positive and negative pairs in contrastive learning as intrapatient and inter-patient samples provides more shared context to learn an effective representation. However, these methods still fail to efficiently exploit patient consistency due to the insufficient amount of intra-inter patient samples existing in a batch. Hence, we propose a contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained model enhanced by the Patient Memory Queue (PMQ), which incorporates a large patient memory queue to mitigate model degeneration that can arise from insufficient intra-inter patient samples. In order to further enhance the performance of the pretrained model, we introduce two extra data augmentation methods to provide more perspectives of positive and negative pairs for pretraining. Extensive experiments were conducted on three public datasets with three different data ratios. The experimental results show that the comprehensive performance of our method outperforms previous contrastive learning methods and exhibits greater robustness in scenarios with limited labeled data. The code is available at https://github.com/3hiuwoo/PMQ.</description>

      <title>A Novel Shape-Aware Topological Representation for GPR Data with DNN Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities, especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and infrastructure management.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasonic sensors are devices that use sound waves to measure distances. They are useful in various applications, such as robotics or factory automation. In this report, the use of these devices for the study of kinematics is presented, specifically to measure the speed of a remote control toy car. The calibration of the sensor achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0,40 cm is presented and then the use of this sensor to measure the speed of the car using an Arduino. The methods of data collection and data analysis are also presented. It is concluded that the ultrasonic sensor is a useful tool for measuring distances and speeds, although its accuracy can be affected by factors such as temperature and humidity.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source Python Framework and Synthetic ECG Image Datasets for Digitization, Lead and Lead Name Detection, and Overlapping Signal Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an open-source Python framework for generating synthetic ECG image datasets to advance critical deep learning-based tasks in ECG analysis, including ECG digitization, lead region and lead name detection, and pixel-level waveform segmentation. Using the PTB-XL signal dataset, our proposed framework produces four open-access datasets: (1) ECG images in various lead configurations paired with time-series signals for ECG digitization, (2) ECG images annotated with YOLO-format bounding boxes for detection of lead region and lead name, (3)-(4) cropped single-lead images with segmentation masks compatible with U-Net-based models in normal and overlapping versions. In the overlapping case, waveforms from neighboring leads are superimposed onto the target lead image, while the segmentation masks remain clean. The open-source Python framework and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/rezakarbasi/ecg-image-and-signal-dataset and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15484519, respectively.</description>

      <title>MoE-Gyro: Self-Supervised Over-Range Reconstruction and Denoising for MEMS Gyroscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by 98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.</description>

      <title>On the Interplay of Privacy, Persuasion and Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a communication-theoretic framework for privacy-aware and resilient decision making in cyber-physical systems under misaligned objectives between the encoder and the decoder. The encoder observes two correlated signals ($X$,$\theta$) and transmits a finite-rate message $Z$ to aid a legitimate controller (the decoder) in estimating $X+\theta$, while an eavesdropper intercepts $Z$ to infer the private parameter $\theta$. Unlike conventional setups where encoder and decoder share a common MSE objective, here the encoder minimizes a Lagrangian that balances legitimate control fidelity and the privacy leakage about $\theta$. In contrast, the decoder's goal is purely to minimize its own estimation error without regard for privacy. We analyze fully, partially, and non-revealing strategies that arise from this conflict, and characterize optimal linear encoders when the rate constraints are lifted. For finite-rate channels, we employ gradient-based methods to compute the optimal controllers. Numerical experiments illustrate how tuning the privacy parameter shapes the trade-off between control performance and resilience against unauthorized inferences.</description>

      <title>Composite Reward Design in PPO-Driven Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-free and reinforcement learning-based adaptive filtering methods are gaining traction for denoising in dynamic, non-stationary environments such as wireless signal channels. Traditional filters like LMS, RLS, Wiener, and Kalman are limited by assumptions of stationary or requiring complex fine-tuning or exact noise statistics or fixed models. This letter proposes an adaptive filtering framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a composite reward that balances SNR improvement, MSE reduction, and residual smoothness. Experiments on synthetic signals with various noise types show that our PPO agent generalizes beyond its training distribution, achieving real-time performance and outperforming classical filters. This work demonstrates the viability of policy-gradient reinforcement learning for robust, low-latency adaptive signal filtering.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Multi-view Arrhythmia Classification from ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deep neural architecture that performs uncertainty-aware multi-view classification of arrhythmia from ECG. Our method learns two different views (1D and 2D) of single-lead ECG to capture different types of information. We use a fusion technique to reduce the conflict between the different views caused by noise and artifacts in ECG data, thus incorporating uncertainty to obtain stronger final predictions. Our framework contains the following three modules (1) a time-series module to learn the morphological features from ECG; (2) an image-space learning module to learn the spatiotemporal features; and (3) the uncertainty-aware fusion module to fuse the information from the two different views. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework not only improves the performance on arrhythmia classification compared to the state-of-the-art but also shows better robustness to noise and artifacts present in ECG.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning Approach for RIS-aided Fair Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties. They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code and datasets to foster further research in the topic.</description>

      <title>LD-RPMNet: Near-Sensor Diagnosis for Railway Point Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-sensor diagnosis has become increasingly prevalent in industry. This study proposes a lightweight model named LD-RPMNet that integrates Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks, leveraging both local and global feature extraction to optimize computational efficiency for a practical railway application. The LD-RPMNet introduces a Multi-scale Depthwise Separable Convolution (MDSC) module, which decomposes cross-channel convolutions into pointwise and depthwise convolutions while employing multi-scale kernels to enhance feature extraction. Meanwhile, a Broadcast Self-Attention (BSA) mechanism is incorporated to simplify complex matrix multiplications and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results based on collected sound signals during the operation of railway point machines demonstrate that the optimized model reduces parameter count and computational complexity by 50% while improving diagnostic accuracy by nearly 3%, ultimately achieving an accuracy of 98.86%. This demonstrates the possibility of near-sensor fault diagnosis applications in railway point machines.</description>

      <title>Multi-Platform Methane Plume Detection via Model and Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prioritizing methane for near-term climate action is crucial due to its significant impact on global warming. Previous work used columnwise matched filter products from the airborne AVIRIS-NG imaging spectrometer to detect methane plume sources; convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discerned anthropogenic methane plumes from false positive enhancements. However, as an increasing number of remote sensing platforms are used for methane plume detection, there is a growing need to address cross-platform alignment. In this work, we describe model- and data-driven machine learning approaches that leverage airborne observations to improve spaceborne methane plume detection, reconciling the distributional shifts inherent with performing the same task across platforms. We develop a spaceborne methane plume classifier using data from the EMIT imaging spectroscopy mission. We refine classifiers trained on airborne imagery from AVIRIS-NG campaigns using transfer learning, outperforming the standalone spaceborne model. Finally, we use CycleGAN, an unsupervised image-to-image translation technique, to align the data distributions between airborne and spaceborne contexts. Translating spaceborne EMIT data to the airborne AVIRIS-NG domain using CycleGAN and applying airborne classifiers directly yields the best plume detection results. This methodology is useful not only for data simulation, but also for direct data alignment. Though demonstrated on the task of methane plume detection, our work more broadly demonstrates a data-driven approach to align related products obtained from distinct remote sensing instruments.</description>

      <title>Heart Rate Classification in ECG Signals Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering, and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis. In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean, variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for modeling infrasound transmission loss in the middle atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission losses (TLs) is essential to assess the performance of the global International Monitoring System infrasound network. Among existing propagation modeling tools, parabolic equation (PE) method enables TLs to be finely modeled, but its computational cost does not allow exploration of a large parameter space for operational monitoring applications. To reduce computation times, Brissaud et al. 2023 explored the potential of convolutional neural networks trained on a large set of regionally simulated wavefields (&lt; 1000 km from the source) to predict TLs with negligible computation times compared to PE simulations. However, this method struggles in unfavorable initial wind conditions, especially at high frequencies, and causal issues with winds at large distances from the source affecting ground TLs close to the source. In this study, we have developed an optimized convolutional network designed to minimize prediction errors while predicting TLs from globally simulated combined temperature and wind fields spanning over propagation ranges of 4000 km. Our approach enhances the previously proposed one by implementing key optimizations that improve the overall architecture performance. The implemented model predicts TLs with an average error of 8.6 dB in the whole frequency band (0.1-3.2 Hz) and explored realistic atmospheric scenarios.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for EEG: A Comprehensive Survey and Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing convergence between Large Language Models (LLMs) and electroencephalography (EEG) research is enabling new directions in neural decoding, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and affective computing. This survey offers a systematic review and structured taxonomy of recent advancements that utilize LLMs for EEG-based analysis and applications. We organize the literature into four domains: (1) LLM-inspired foundation models for EEG representation learning, (2) EEG-to-language decoding, (3) cross-modal generation including image and 3D object synthesis, and (4) clinical applications and dataset management tools. The survey highlights how transformer-based architectures adapted through fine-tuning, few-shot, and zero-shot learning have enabled EEG-based models to perform complex tasks such as natural language generation, semantic interpretation, and diagnostic assistance. By offering a structured overview of modeling strategies, system designs, and application areas, this work serves as a foundational resource for future work to bridge natural language processing and neural signal analysis through language models.</description>

      <title>Towards real-time assessment of infrasound event detection capability using deep learning-based transmission loss estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is essential for evaluating the performance of the International Monitoring System, enabling the effective design and maintenance of infrasound stations to support compliance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. State-of-the-art propagation modeling tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models. However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included in the training. This represents a significant step towards near real-time assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive sources.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizable Drowsiness Monitoring with Physiological Sensors: A Preliminary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately detecting drowsiness is vital to driving safety. Among all measures, physiological-signal-based drowsiness monitoring can be more privacy-preserving than a camera-based approach. However, conflicts exist regarding how physiological metrics are associated with different drowsiness labels across datasets. Thus, we analyzed key features from electrocardiograms (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiratory (RESP) signals across four datasets, where different drowsiness inducers (such as fatigue and low arousal) and assessment methods (subjective vs. objective) were used. Binary logistic regression models were built to identify the physiological metrics that are associated with drowsiness. Findings indicate that distinct different drowsiness inducers can lead to different physiological responses, and objective assessments were more sensitive than subjective ones in detecting drowsiness. Further, the increased heart rate stability, reduced respiratory amplitude, and decreased tonic EDA are robustly associated with increased drowsiness. The results enhance understanding of drowsiness detection and can inform future generalizable monitoring designs.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Decomposition of Electrodermal Activity for Real-World Mental Health Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decomposing Electrodermal Activity (EDA) into phasic (short-term, stimulus-linked responses) and tonic (longer-term baseline) components is essential for extracting meaningful emotional and physiological biomarkers. This study presents a comparative analysis of knowledge-driven, statistical, and deep learning-based methods for EDA signal decomposition, with a focus on in-the-wild data collected from wearable devices. In particular, the authors introduce the Feel Transformer, a novel Transformer-based model adapted from the Autoformer architecture, designed to separate phasic and tonic components without explicit supervision. The model leverages pooling and trend-removal mechanisms to enforce physiologically meaningful decompositions. Comparative experiments against methods such as Ledalab, cvxEDA, and conventional detrending show that the Feel Transformer achieves a balance between feature fidelity (SCR frequency, amplitude, and tonic slope) and robustness to noisy, real-world data. The model demonstrates potential for real-time biosignal analysis and future applications in stress prediction, digital mental health interventions, and physiological forecasting.</description>

      <title>Restoration of contaminated data in an Intensity Mapping survey using deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) is a promising approach to detecting information about the large-scale structure beyond the local universe. One of the biggest challenges for an IM observation is the foreground removal procedure. In this paper, we attempt to conduct the restoration of contaminated data in an IM experiment with a Deep Neural Network (DNN). To investigate the impact of such data restoration, we compare the root-mean-square (RMS) of data with and without restoration after foreground removal using polynomial fitting, singular value decomposition, and independent component analysis, respectively. We find that the DNN-based pipeline performs well in lowering the RMS level of data, especially for data with large contaminated fractions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the restoration on the large-scale 21-cm signal in the simulation generated by CRIME. Simulation results show that the angular power spectrum curves from data with restoration are closer to the real one. Our work demonstrates that the DNN-based data restoration approach significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio compared with conventional ones, achieving excellent potential for IM observations.</description>

      <title>Model-based Neural Data Augmentation for sub-wavelength Radio Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical fingerprinting methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To manage and optimize constantly evolving wireless networks, existing machine learning (ML)- based studies operate as black-box models, leading to increased computational costs during training and a lack of transparency in decision-making, which limits their practical applicability in wireless networks. Motivated by recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-enabled wireless networks, this paper proposes ProWin, a novel framework that leverages reinforced in-context learning to design task-specific demonstration Prompts for Wireless Network optimization, relying on the inference capabilities of LLMs without the need for dedicated model training or finetuning. The task-specific prompts are designed to incorporate natural language descriptions of the task description and formulation, enhancing interpretability and eliminating the need for specialized expertise in network optimization. We further propose a reinforced in-context learning scheme that incorporates a set of advisable examples into task-specific prompts, wherein informative examples capturing historical environment states and decisions are adaptively selected to guide current decision-making. Evaluations on a case study of base station power control showcases that the proposed ProWin outperforms reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, highlighting the potential for next-generation future wireless network optimization.</description>

      <title>RIS Size Determination Across Frequencies and Deployment Scenarios: A Simulation-Based Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in the integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) into next-generation wireless communications systems, a critical gap remains in understanding what the dimensions of an RIS must be to provide meaningful performance gains across realistic deployment scenarios. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a practical and scenario-aware methodology for determining optimal RIS dimensions, tailored to specific frequency bands, environments, and use cases. Leveraging a realistic simulation model that incorporates angular scattering characteristics, practical network node locations, and propagation constraints, we evaluate the RIS-assisted performance in a diverse set of configurations. For selected use-cases, we quantify key performance indicators such as average signal-to-noise ratio and outage probability, and we demonstrate how RIS size impacts system reliability. Our findings show that RIS deployment effectiveness is highly sensitive to both physical size and geometric placement, and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The proposed framework, supported by detailed use case tables and validated through comprehensive simulations, offers design guidelines for operators and vendors seeking to deploy RIS in practical wireless network settings.</description>

      <title>Toward High Accuracy DME for Alternative Aircraft Positioning: SFOL Pulse Transmission in High-Power DME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stretched-FrOnt-Leg (SFOL) pulse is an advanced distance measuring equipment (DME) pulse that offers superior ranging accuracy compared to conventional Gaussian pulses. Successful SFOL pulse transmission has been recently demonstrated from a commercial Gaussian pulse-based DME in low-power mode utilizing digital predistortion (DPD) techniques for power amplifiers. These adjustments were achieved through software modifications, enabling SFOL integration without replacing existing DME infrastructure. However, the SFOL pulse is designed to optimize ranging capabilities by leveraging the effective radiated power (ERP) and pulse shape parameters permitted within DME specifications. Consequently, it operates with narrow margins against these specifications, potentially leading to non-compliance when transmitted in high-power mode. This paper introduces strategies to enable a Gaussian pulse-based DME to transmit the SFOL pulse while adhering to DME specifications in high-power mode. The proposed strategies involve use of a variant of the SFOL pulse and DPD techniques utilizing truncated singular value decomposition, tailored for high-power DME operations. Test results, conducted on a testbed utilizing a commercial Gaussian pulse-based DME, demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, ensuring compliance with DME specifications in high-power mode with minimal performance loss. This study enables cost-effective integration of high-accuracy SFOL pulses into existing high-power DME systems, enhancing aircraft positioning precision while ensuring compliance with industry standards.</description>

      <title>IQFM A Wireless Foundational Model for I/Q Streams in AI-Native 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational models have shown remarkable potential in natural language processing and computer vision, yet remain in their infancy in wireless communications. While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification, angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations, such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data, achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification, respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves 94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs. 96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Spreading-Factor-Index-Aided LoRa Scheme: Design and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LoRa is a widely recognized modulation technology in the field of low power wide area networks (LPWANs). However, the data rate of LoRa is too low to satisfy the requirements in the context of modern Internet of Things (IoT) applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel high-data-rate LoRa scheme based on the spreading factor index (SFI). In the proposed SFI-LoRa scheme, the starting frequency bin (SFB) of chirp signals is used to transmit information bits, while the combinations of spreading factors (SFs) are exploited as a set of indices to convey additional information bits. Moreover, theoretical expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) and throughput of the proposed SFI-LoRa scheme are derived over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation results not only verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis, but also demonstrate that the proposed SFI-LoRa scheme improves both the bit error rate (BER) and throughput performance compared to existing high-data-rate LoRa schemes. Therefore, the proposed SFI-LoRa scheme is a potential solution for applications requiring a high data rate in the LPWAN domain.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO under a Non-Linear Power Amplifier Consumption Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing works on Cell-Free Massive MIMO primarily focus on optimising system throughput and energy efficiency under high-traffic scenarios with only a limited focus on variable user demand as required by higher network layers. Additionally, existing works only minimise the transmitted power instead of the consumed power at the power amplifier. This work introduces a penalty-method-based approach to minimise the amplifier's power consumption while scaling much better with network size than current solutions and promoting sparsity in the power allocated to each access point. Furthermore, we demonstrate substantial reductions in power consumption (up to 24%) by considering the non-linear power consumption.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Network Function Disaggregation in Hybrid Non-terrestrial Open Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) principles with non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and investigates the optimization of the functional split between Centralized Units (CU) and Distributed Units (DU) to improve energy efficiency in dynamic network environments. Given the inherent constraints of NTN platforms, such as Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and high-altitude platform stations (HAPS), we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework utilizing Deep Q-Network (DQN) to intelligently determine the optimal RAN functional split. The proposed approach dynamically adapts to real-time fluctuations in traffic demand, network conditions, and power limitations, ensuring efficient resource allocation and enhanced system performance.The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed policy effectively adapts to network traffic flow by selecting an efficient network disaggregation strategy and corresponding functional split option based on data rate and latency requirements.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-Native Fronthaul: Neural Compression for NextG Cloud RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of data traffic and the emerging AI-native wireless architectures in NextG cellular systems place new demands on the fronthaul links of Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RAN). In this paper, we investigate neural compression techniques for the Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI), aiming to reduce the fronthaul bandwidth while preserving signal quality. We introduce two deep learning-based compression algorithms designed to optimize the transformation of wireless signals into bit sequences for CPRI transmission. The first algorithm utilizes a non-linear transformation coupled with scalar/vector quantization based on a learned codebook. The second algorithm generates a latent vector transformed into a variable-length output bit sequence via arithmetic encoding, guided by the predicted probability distribution of each latent element. Novel techniques such as a shared weight model for storage-limited devices and a successive refinement model for managing multiple CPRI links with varying Quality of Service (QoS) are proposed. Extensive simulation results demonstrate notable Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) gains with improved rate-distortion performance for both algorithms compared to traditional methods. The proposed solutions are robust to variations in channel conditions, modulation formats, and noise levels, highlighting their potential for enabling efficient and scalable fronthaul in NextG AI-native networks as well as aligning with the current 3GPP research directions.</description>

      <title>Conditional Denoising Diffusion for ISAC Enhanced Channel Estimation in Cell-Free 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) aims to revolutionize 6th Generation (6G) networks. By combining distributed access points with ISAC capabilities, it boosts spectral efficiency, situational awareness, and communication reliability. Channel estimation is a critical step in cell-free ISAC systems to ensure reliable communication, but its performance is usually limited by challenges such as pilot contamination and noisy channel estimates. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging sensing information as a key input within a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model (CDDM). In this framework, we integrate CDDM with a Multimodal Transformer (MMT) to enhance channel estimation in ISAC-enabled cell-free systems. The MMT encoder effectively captures inter-modal relationships between sensing and location data, enabling the CDDM to iteratively denoise and refine channel estimates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance gains. As compared with Least Squares (LS) and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) estimators, the proposed model achieves normalized mean squared error (NMSE) improvements of 8 dB and 9 dB, respectively. Moreover, we achieve a 27.8% NMSE improvement compared to the traditional denoising diffusion model (TDDM), which does not incorporate sensing channel information. Additionally, the model exhibits higher robustness against pilot contamination and maintains high accuracy under challenging conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). According to the simulation results, the model performs well for users near sensing targets by leveraging the correlation between sensing and communication channels.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication for Multi-Target Indication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the near-field regime offers the potential to jointly support high-rate downlink transmission and high-resolution multi-target detection by exploiting the spherical-wave nature of electromagnetic propagation. In this paper, we propose a unified beamforming framework for a multi-user multi-target near-field ISAC system. In this system, a multi-antenna base station simultaneously serves multiple single-antenna users and senses multiple point-targets without prior knowledge of their radar cross sections. By optimizing the transmit covariance matrix, our design maximizes the minimum weighted transmit beampattern gain across all targets to ensure accurate sensing while strictly limiting inter-target cross-correlations and guaranteeing per-user communication rate and total power constraints. We extend classical far-field beampattern and cross-correlation measures to the near-field by incorporating both angle and range dependencies, enabling discrimination of targets along the same direction but at different distances. The resulting non-convex program is efficiently relaxed to a semidefinite program via rank-one lifting. We then develop a closed-form reconstruction to recover optimal rank-one beamformers. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our near-field ISAC design can simultaneously resolve and serve users/targets along the same direction but at different distances, achieving significant gains over far-field and single-target benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Circuit-Based Modeling Approach for Channel Estimation in RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been explored as a supportive technology for wireless communication since around 2019. While the literature highlights the potential of RIS in different modern applications, two key issues have gained significant attention from the research community: channel estimation and phase shift optimization. The performance gains of RIS-assisted systems rely heavily on optimal phase shifts, which, in turn, depend on accurate channel estimation. Several studies have addressed these challenges under different assumptions. Some works consider a range of continuous phase shifts, while others propose a limited number of discrete phase values for the RIS elements. Many studies present an idealized perspective, whereas others aim to approximate more practical aspects by considering circuit system responses and employing phase shifts derived from a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or other lookup tables. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the influence of circuit system parameters on channel estimation and subsequent phase shift optimization. This paper models each RIS element as an equivalent resonant circuit composed of resistance, capacitance, and inductance. We propose that resistance and capacitance parameters can be dynamically and independently configured, leading to the formulation of an impedance matrix. Furthermore, we construct a circuit-based RIS phase shift matrix that accounts for the response of the resonant circuit, which changes with variations in the physical parameters of resistance and capacitance. We investigate the impact of this circuit-based RIS phase shift within a tensor-based channel estimation approach. Our results indicate a performance loss compared to ideal scenarios, such as those using the DFT design. However, we found that increasing the training time can mitigate this performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel and Symbol Estimation for Communication Systems with Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication systems aided by movable antennas have been the subject of recent research due to their potentially increased spatial degrees of freedom offered by optimizing the antenna positioning at the transmitter and/or receiver. In this context, a topic that deserves attention is channel estimation. Conventional methods reported recently rely on pilot-assisted strategies to estimate the channel coefficients. In this work, we address the joint channel and symbol estimation problem for an uplink multi-user communication system, where the base station is equipped with a movable antenna array. A semi-blind receiver based on the PARAFAC2 model is formulated to exploit the tensor decomposition structure for the received signals, from which channel and symbol estimates can be jointly obtained via an alternating estimation algorithm. Compared with reference schemes, our preliminary numerical simulations yield remarkable results for the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Domain CFO Estimation Using Jutted Binary Modulation on Conjugate-Reciprocal Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07256v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose jutted binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (J-BMOCZ) for non-coherent communication under a carrier frequency offset (CFO). By introducing asymmetry to the Huffman BMOCZ zero constellation, we exploit the identical aperiodic auto-correlation function of BMOCZ sequences to derive a Fourier-domain metric for CFO estimation. Unlike the existing methods for Huffman BMOCZ, which require a cyclically permutable code (CPC) for pilot-free CFO correction, J-BMOCZ enables the estimation of a CFO without the use of pilots or channel coding. Through numerical simulations in additive white Gaussian noise and fading channels, we show that the bit error rate (BER) loss of J-BMOCZ under a CFO is just 1 dB over Huffman BMOCZ without a CFO. Furthermore, the results show that coded J-BMOCZ achieves better BER performance than Huffman BMOCZ with a CPC.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Beyond Diagonal RIS under Hardware Impairments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) improves the traditional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architecture functionality by interconnecting elements for advanced wave control. However, real-world implementations face hardware imperfections, such as impedance mismatches and varactor nonidealities, which can degrade overall system performance. In this paper, we propose three hardware impairment models that directly affect the BD-RIS scattering matrix structure and evaluate their impact on the channel estimation accuracy using the normalized mean square error (NMSE) as a performance metric. The proposed impairment models consider imperfections affecting self-impedances, mutual impedances, or both. Our results reveal how each impairment type degrades the system performance, allowing us to identify scenarios where the traditional RIS can outperform the BD-RIS.</description>

      <title>Real-Time High-Accuracy Digital Wireless Time, Frequency, and Phase Calibration For Coherent Distributed Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a fully-digital high-accuracy real-time calibration procedure for frequency and time alignment of open-loop wirelessly coordinated coherent distributed antenna array (CDA) modems, enabling RF phase coherence of spatially separated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software-defined radios (SDRs) without any cables or external references such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Building on previous work using high-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multi-step ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based time-frequency coordination approach is demonstrated. By using a high-accuracy time estimation approach, frequency estimates can be derived over long observation intervals leading to a high-accuracy frequency estimate, without the requirement for long pulse durations as is required for direct spectral frequency estimation techniques, minimizing coordination overhead. Furthermore, due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency estimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch.
  This technique is experimentally verified by demonstrating wireless distributed array coordination using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability were measured over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope and achieved time and phase coordination precision of ~60-70 ps, with median coherent gains above 99% using optimized parameters, and a beamforming frequency RMSE of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare the performance of this technique with previous work works using an analog continuous-wave two-tone (CWTT) frequency reference technique in both static and dynamic settings as a benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07300v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we move towards 6G, the demand for high-precision, cost-effective positioning solutions becomes increasingly critical. Single-anchor positioning offers a promising alternative to traditional multi-anchor approaches, particularly in complex propagation environments where infrastructure costs and deployment constraints present significant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of key algorithmic choices in the development of a single-anchor 5G uplink positioning testbed. Our developed testbed uses angle of arrival (AoA) estimation combined with range measurements from an ultra-wideband pair, to derive the position. The simulations conducted assess the impact of the selected algorithms on channel order and AoA estimation, while the influence of antenna calibration errors on AoA estimation is also examined. Finally, we compare simulations and results obtained from our developed platform.</description>

      <title>Decoding Saccadic Eye Movements from Brain Signals Using an Endovascular Neural Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Oculomotor Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) records neural activity from regions of the brain involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful oculomotor BCI studies primarily relied on invasive microelectrode implants in non-human primates, this study investigates the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular Stentrode device implanted near the supplementary motor area in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To achieve this, self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks were designed, in which the participant performed saccades in four directions (left, right, up, down), with simultaneous recording of endovascular EEG and eye gaze. The visually guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas the free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. The results showed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped with the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions. In contrast, classifying saccade direction proved more challenging, yielding within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best-performing binary comparisons (left vs. up and left vs. down). This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in an ALS patient, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained traction in academia and industry. Recently, multipath components (MPCs), as a type of spatial resource, have the potential to improve the sensing performance in ISAC systems, especially in richly scattering environments. In this paper, we propose to leverage MPC and Khatri-Rao space-time (KRST) code within a single ISAC system to realize high-accuracy sensing for multiple dynamic targets and multi-user communication. Specifically, we propose a novel MPC-enhanced sensing processing scheme with symbol-level fusion, referred to as the "SL-MPS" scheme, to achieve high-accuracy localization of multiple dynamic targets and empower the single ISAC system with a new capability of absolute velocity estimation for multiple targets with a single sensing attempt. Furthermore, the KRST code is applied to flexibly balance communication and sensing performance in richly scattering environments. To evaluate the contribution of MPCs, the closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) of location and absolute velocity estimation are derived. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed SL-MPS scheme is more robust and accurate in localization and absolute velocity estimation compared with the existing state-of-the-art schemes.</description>

      <title>A Unified Anti-Jamming Design in Complex Environments Based on Cross-Modal Fusion and Intelligent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of radar jamming systems, especially digital radio frequency memory (DRFM), the electromagnetic environment has become increasingly complex. In recent years, most existing studies have focused solely on either jamming recognition or anti-jamming strategy design. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that integrates interference recognition with intelligent anti-jamming strategy selection. Specifically, time-frequency (TF) features of radar echoes are first extracted using both Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD). A feature fusion method is then designed to effectively combine these two types of time-frequency representations. The fused TF features are further combined with time-domain features of the radar echoes through a cross-modal fusion module based on an attention mechanism. Finally, the recognition results, together with information obtained from the passive radar, are fed into a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based intelligent anti-jamming strategy network to select jamming suppression waveforms. The key jamming parameters obtained by the passive radar provide essential information for intelligent decision-making, enabling the generation of more effective strategies tailored to specific jamming types. The proposed method demonstrates improvements in both jamming type recognition accuracy and the stability of anti-jamming strategy selection under complex environments. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance compared to Support Vector Machines (SVM), VGG-16, and 2D-CNN methods, with respective improvements of 1.41%, 2.5%, and 14.51% in overall accuracy. Moreover, in comparison with the SARSA algorithm, the designed algorithm achieves faster reward convergence and more stable strategy generation.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Aided Online FDD Precoding via Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Sensing: A Vertical Federated Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a heterogeneous multi-vehicle, multi-modal sensing (H-MVMM) aided online precoding problem. The proposed H-MVMM scheme utilizes a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework to minimize pilot sequence length and optimize the sum rate. This offers a promising solution for reducing latency in frequency division duplexing systems. To achieve this, three preprocessing modules are designed to transform raw sensory data into informative representations relevant to precoding. The approach effectively addresses local data heterogeneity arising from diverse on-board sensor configurations through a well-structured VFL training procedure. Additionally, a label-free online model updating strategy is introduced, enabling the H-MVMM scheme to adapt its weights flexibly. This strategy features a pseudo downlink channel state information label simulator (PCSI-Simulator), which is trained using a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach alongside an online loss function. Numerical results show that the proposed method can closely approximate the performance of traditional optimization techniques with perfect channel state information, achieving a significant 90.6\% reduction in pilot sequence length.</description>

      <title>Computation Capacity Maximization for Pinching Antennas-Assisted Wireless Powered MEC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper,we investigate a novel wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system assisted by pinching antennas (PAs), where devices first harvest energy from a base station and then offload computation-intensive tasks to an MEC server. As an emerging technology, PAs utilize long dielectric waveguides embedded with multiple localized dielectric particles, which can be spatially configured through a pinching mechanism to effectively reduce large-scale propagation loss. This capability facilitates both efficient downlink energy transfer and uplink task offloading. To fully exploit these advantages, we adopt a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework and formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the system's computational capacity by jointly optimizing device transmit power, time allocation, PA positions in both uplink and downlink, and radiation control. To address the resulting non-convexity caused by variable coupling, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm that integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) with successive convex approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted design substantially improves both energy harvesting efficiency and computational performance compared to conventional antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Transceiver Design for RIS Enhanced Dual-Functional Radar-Communication with Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the performance of dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems. In this paper, we explore an MA-aided DFRC system that utilizes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance signal coverage for communications in dead zones. To enhance the radar sensing performance in practical DFRC environments, we propose a unified robust transceiver design framework aimed at maximizing the minimum radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a cluttered environment. Our approach jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, receive filtering, antenna placement, and RIS reflecting coefficients under imperfect channel state information (CSI) for both sensing and communication channels. To deal with the channel uncertainty-constrained issue, we leverage the convex hull method to transform the primal problem into a more tractable form. We then introduce a two-layer block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, incorporating fractional programming (FP), successive convex approximation (SCA), S-Lemma, and penalty techniques to reformulate it into a series of semidefinite program (SDP) subproblems that can be efficiently solved. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the convergence and computational complexity for the proposed design framework. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, and show that the MA-based design framework can significantly enhance the radar SINR performance while achieving an effective balance between the radar and communication performance.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model Empowered Synesthesia of Machines (SoM): AI-native Intelligent Multi-Modal Sensing-Communication Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support future intelligent multifunctional sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, Synesthesia of Machines (SoM) is proposed as a novel paradigm for artificial intelligence (AI)-native intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication integration. However, existing SoM system designs rely on task-specific AI models and face challenges such as scarcity of massive high-quality datasets, constrained modeling capability, poor generalization, and limited universality. Recently, foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a new deep learning paradigm and have been preliminarily applied to SoM-related tasks, but a systematic design framework is still lacking. In this paper, we for the first time present a systematic categorization of FMs for SoM system design, dividing them into general-purpose FMs, specifically large language models (LLMs), and SoM domain-specific FMs, referred to as wireless foundation models. Furthermore, we derive key characteristics of FMs in addressing existing challenges in SoM systems and propose two corresponding roadmaps, i.e., LLM-based and wireless foundation model-based design. For each roadmap, we provide a framework containing key design steps as a guiding pipeline and several representative case studies of FM-empowered SoM system design. Specifically, we propose LLM-based path loss generation (LLM4PG) and scatterer generation (LLM4SG) schemes, and wireless channel foundation model (WiCo) for SoM mechanism exploration, LLM-based wireless multi-task SoM transceiver (LLM4WM) and wireless foundation model (WiFo) for SoM-enhanced transceiver design, and wireless cooperative perception foundation model (WiPo) for SoM-enhanced cooperative perception, demonstrating the significant superiority of FMs over task-specific models. Finally, we summarize and highlight potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>CommSense: A Rapid and Accurate ISAC Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future 6G networks envisions to blur the line between communication and sensing, leveraging ubiquitous OFDM waveforms for both high throughput data and environmental awareness. In this work, we do a thorough analysis of Communication based Sensing (CommSense) framework that embeds lightweight, PCA based detectors into standard OFDM receivers; enabling real-time, device free detection of passive scatterers (e.g.\ drones, vehicles etc.) without any extra transmitters. Starting from a realistic three link Rician channel model (direct Tx\(\rightarrow\)Rx, cascaded Tx\(\rightarrow\)Scatterer and Scatterer\(\rightarrow\)Rx), we compare four detectors: the full dimensional Likelihood Ratio Test (Full LRT), PCA based LRT, PCA+SVM with linear and RBF kernels. By projecting \(N\)-dimensional CSI onto a \(P\ll N\) principal component subspace, inference time gets reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the full LRT, while achieving optimal error rates i.e. empirical errors align tightly with the Bhattacharyya error bound and Area Under ROC Curve (AUC)\(\approx1\) for \(P\approx10\). PCA+SVM classifiers further improve robustness in very high dimensions (\(N=1024\)), maintaining AUC\(\gtrsim0.60\) at \(-10\)dB and exceeding 0.90 by 0dB even when full LRT fails due to numerical overflow. From the simulated result we have shown LRT based techniques are susceptible to the parameter estimation error, where as SVM is resilient to that. Our results demonstrate that PCA driven detection when paired with lightweight SVMs can deliver fast, accurate, and robust scatterer sensing, paving the way for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models-Aided Uplink Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a channel estimation method for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems through a novel diffusion model (DM) framework. We reformulate the channel estimation problem as a denoising process, which aligns with the reverse process of the DM. To overcome the inherent randomness in the reverse process of conventional DM approaches, we adopt a deterministic sampling strategy with a step alignment mechanism that ensures the accuracy of channel estimation while adapting to different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters of the U-Net, we meticulously design a lightweight network that achieves comparable performance, thereby enhancing the practicality of our proposed method. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance over a wide range of SNRs compared to baselines. For instance, the proposed method achieves performance improvements of up to 13.5 dB in normalized mean square error (NMSE) at SNR = 0 dB. Notably, the proposed lightweight network exhibits almost no performance loss compared to the original U-Net, while requiring only 6.59\% of its parameters.</description>

      <title>Device-Free Localization with Multiple Antenna Receivers: Simulations and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-Free Localization (DFL) is a passive radio method able to detect, estimate, and localize targets (e.g., human or other obstacles) that do not need to carry any electronic device. According to the Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) paradigm, DFL networks exploit Radio Frequency (RF) devices, used for communication purposes, to evaluate also the excess attenuation due to targets moving in the monitored area, to estimate the target positions and movements. Several target models have been discussed in the literature to evaluate the target positions by exploiting the RF signals received by networked devices. Among these models, Electromagnetic (EM) body models emerged as an interesting research field for excess attenuation prediction using commercial RF devices. While these RF devices are usually single-antenna boards, the availability of low-cost multi-antenna devices e.g. those used in WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) scenarios, allow us to exploit array-based signal processing techniques for DFL applications as well. Using an array-capable EM body model, this paper shows how to employ array-based processing to improve angular detection of targets. Unlike single-antenna devices that can provide only attenuation information, multi-antenna devices can provide both angular and attenuation estimates about the target location. To this end, simulations are presented and preliminary results are discussed. The proposed framework paves the way for a wider use of multi-antenna devices based, for instance, on WiFi6 and WiFi7 standards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of 5G and the emergence of 6G wireless communication systems impose higher demands for computing capabilities and lower power consumption in the front-end and processing circuitry. Furthermore, the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) in the Radio Access Network (RAN) introduces heightened computational needs and stringent low-latency requirements for both training and inference. The concept of a Base Station on Chip (BSoC) addresses those demands by consolidating of the signal processing, neural network computations and network management functions into a single chip. This new computing platform relies on a sophisticated hardware/software co-design to optimize performance, power efficiency, and scalability, enabling a compact, yet adaptable and intelligent base station solution for next-generation wireless networks. This research investigates the efficient implementation of conventional Channel Estimation (CE), massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO), and beamforming kernels on a state-of-the-art RISC-V vector Digital Signal Processors (DSP) to capitalize on Data Level Parallelism (DLP). Moreover, it explores how RISC-V Vector Extensions (RVV) combined with custom instructions can effectively address the throughput and latency demands of LOW Physical Layer (PHY) kernels.</description>

      <title>Phase-Only Positioning: Overcoming Integer Ambiguity Challenge through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates uplink carrier phase positioning (CPP) in cell-free (CF) or distributed antenna system context, assuming a challenging case where only phase measurements are utilized as observations. In general, CPP can achieve sub-meter to centimeter-level accuracy but is challenged by the integer ambiguity problem. In this work, we propose two deep learning approaches for phase-only positioning, overcoming the integer ambiguity challenge. The first one directly uses phase measurements, while the second one first estimates integer ambiguities and then integrates them with phase measurements for improved accuracy. Our numerical results demonstrate that an inference complexity reduction of two to three orders of magnitude is achieved, compared to maximum likelihood baseline solution, depending on the approach and parameter configuration. This emphasizes the potential of the developed deep learning solutions for efficient and precise positioning in future CF 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Double Low-Rank 4D Tensor Decomposition for Circular RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO-NOMA System Channel Estimation in Mobility Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation is not only essential to highly reliable data transmission and massive device access but also an important component of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems. In this paper, we consider a downlink channel estimation problem for circular reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) system in mobility scenarios. First, we propose a subframe partitioning scheme to facilitate the modeling of the received signal as a fourth-order tensor satisfying a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) form, thereby formulating the channel estimation problem as tensor decomposition and parameter extraction problems. Then, by exploiting both the global and local low-rank properties of the received signal, we propose a double low-rank 4D tensor decomposition model to decompose the received signal into four factor matrices, which is efficiently solved via alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Subsequently, we propose a two-stage parameter estimation method based on the Jacobi-Anger expansion and the special structure of circular RIS to uniquely decouple the angle parameters. Furthermore, the time delay, Doppler shift, and channel gain parameters can also be estimated without ambiguities, and their estimation accuracy can be efficiently improved, especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Finally, a concise closed-form expression for the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) is derived as a performance benchmark. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the other discussed methods.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Super-Resolution Signature Estimation of XL-MIMO FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely Large-Scale (XL) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna systems combined with ultra-wide signal bandwidth (BW) offer the potential for ultra-high-resolution sensing in frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. However, the use of ultra-wide BW results in significant spatial delays across the array aperture, comparable to the range resolution, leading to the spatial wideband effect (SWE). SWE introduces coupling between the range and angle domains, rendering conventional narrowband signal processing techniques ineffective for target signature estimation. In this paper, we propose an efficient super-resolution signature estimation technique for XL-MIMO FMCW radars operating under SWE, leveraging compressive sensing (CS) methods. The proposed 2D CS-based approach offers low computational complexity, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in large-scale radar systems. Numerical simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing wideband and narrowband estimation techniques.</description>

      <title>Infinity Search: Approximate Vector Search with Projections on q-Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of vector search applications, prevailing search algorithms overlook the metric structure of vector embeddings, treating it as a constraint rather than exploiting its underlying properties. In this paper, we demonstrate that in $q$-metric spaces, metric trees can leverage a stronger version of the triangle inequality to reduce comparisons for exact search. Notably, as $q$ approaches infinity, the search complexity becomes logarithmic. Therefore, we propose a novel projection method that embeds vector datasets with arbitrary dissimilarity measures into $q$-metric spaces while preserving the nearest neighbor. We propose to learn an approximation of this projection to efficiently transform query points to a space where euclidean distances satisfy the desired properties. Our experimental results with text and image vector embeddings show that learning $q$-metric approximations enables classic metric tree algorithms -- which typically underperform with high-dimensional data -- to achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art search methods.</description>

      <title>Cyber Security of Sensor Systems for State Sequence Estimation: an AI Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor systems are extremely popular today and vulnerable to sensor data attacks. Due to possible devastating consequences, counteracting sensor data attacks is an extremely important topic, which has not seen sufficient study. This paper develops the first methods that accurately identify/eliminate only the problematic attacked sensor data presented to a sequence estimation/regression algorithm under a powerful attack model constructed based on known/observed attacks. The approach does not assume a known form for the statistical model of the sensor data, allowing data-driven and machine learning sequence estimation/regression algorithms to be protected. A simple protection approach for attackers not endowed with knowledge of the details of our protection approach is first developed, followed by additional processing for attacks based on protection system knowledge. In the cases tested for which it was designed, experimental results show that the simple approach achieves performance indistinguishable, to two decimal places, from that for an approach which knows which sensors are attacked. For cases where the attacker has knowledge of the protection approach, experimental results indicate the additional processing can be configured so that the worst-case degradation under the additional processing and a large number of sensors attacked can be made significantly smaller than the worst-case degradation of the simple approach, and close to an approach which knows which sensors are attacked, for the same number of attacked sensors with just a slight degradation under no attacks. Mathematical descriptions of the worst-case attacks are used to demonstrate the additional processing will provide similar advantages for cases for which we do not have numerical results. All the data-driven processing used in our approaches employ only unattacked training data.</description>

      <title>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Based on Image Load Signatures and Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end, this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates "image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices; at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the RISC-V instruction set architecture, focusing on its modular design, implementation challenges, and performance characteristics. We examine the RV32I base instruction set with extensions for multiplication (M) and atomic operations (A). Through cycle-accurate simulation of a pipelined implementation, we evaluate performance metrics including CPI (cycles per instruction) and power efficiency. Our results demonstrate RISC-V's advantages in embedded systems and its scalability for custom accelerators. Comparative analysis shows a 17% reduction in power consumption compared to ARM Cortex-M0 implementations in similar process nodes. The open-standard nature of RISC-V provides significant flexibility for domain-specific optimizations.</description>

      <title>Neural Spectral Band Generation for Audio Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio bandwidth extension is the task of reconstructing missing high frequency components of bandwidth-limited audio signals, where bandwidth limitation is a common issue for audio signals due to several reasons, including channel capacity and data constraints. While conventional spectral band replication is a well-established parametric approach to audio bandwidth extension, the SBR usually entails coarse feature extraction and reconstruction techniques, which leads to limitations when processing various types of audio signals. In parallel, numerous deep neural network-based audio bandwidth extension methods have been proposed. These DNN-based methods are usually referred to as blind BWE, as these methods do not rely on prior information extracted from original signals, and only utilize given low frequency band signals to estimate missing high frequency components. In order to replace conventional SBR with DNNs, simply adopting existing DNN-based methodologies results in suboptimal performance due to the blindness of these methods. My proposed research suggests a new approach to parametric non-blind bandwidth extension, as DNN-based side information extraction and DNN-based bandwidth extension are performed only at the front and end of the audio coding pipeline.</description>

      <title>MIMO Pinching-Antenna-Aided SWIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have recently emerged as a promising technology for improving wireless communications by establishing or strengthening reliable line-of-sight (LoS) links by adjusting the positions of pinching antennas (PAs). Motivated by these benefits, we propose a novel PASS-aided multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where the PASS are equipped with multiple waveguides to provide information transmission and wireless power transfer (WPT) for several multiple antenna information decoding receivers (IDRs), and energy harvesting receivers (EHRs), respectively. Based on the system, we consider maximizing the sum-rate of all IDRs while guaranteeing the minimum harvested energy of each EHR by jointly optimizing the pinching beamforming and the PA positions. To solve this highly non-convex problem, we iteratively optimize the pinching beamforming based on a weighted minimum mean-squared-error (WMMSE) method and update the PA positions with a Gauss-Seidel-based approach in an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Numerical results verify the significant superiority of the PASS compared with conventional designs.</description>

      <title>Deep Inertial Pose: A deep learning approach for human pose estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda) Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation, window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error. This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose, with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.</description>

      <title>SPC to 3D: Novel View Synthesis from Binary SPC via I2I translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) represent a cutting-edge imaging technology, capable of detecting individual photons with remarkable timing precision. Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image (I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline (Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.</description>

      <title>Deep regularization networks for inverse problems with noisy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A supervised learning approach is proposed for regularization of large inverse problems where the main operator is built from noisy data. This is germane to superresolution imaging via the sampling indicators of the inverse scattering theory. We aim to accelerate the spatiotemporal regularization process for this class of inverse problems to enable real-time imaging. In this approach, a neural operator maps each pattern on the right-hand side of the scattering equation to its affiliated regularization parameter. The network is trained in two steps which entails: (1) training on low-resolution regularization maps furnished by the Morozov discrepancy principle with nonoptimal thresholds, and (2) optimizing network predictions through minimization of the Tikhonov loss function regulated by the validation loss. Step 2 allows for tailoring of the approximate maps of Step 1 toward construction of higher quality images. This approach enables direct learning from test data and dispenses with the need for a-priori knowledge of the optimal regularization maps. The network, trained on low-resolution data, quickly generates dense regularization maps for high-resolution imaging. We highlight the importance of the training loss function on the network's generalizability. In particular, we demonstrate that networks informed by the logic of discrepancy principle lead to images of higher contrast. In this case, the training process involves many-objective optimization. We propose a new method to adaptively select the appropriate loss weights during training without requiring an additional optimization process. The proposed approach is synthetically examined for imaging damage evolution in an elastic plate. The results indicate that the discrepancy-informed regularization networks not only accelerate the imaging process, but also remarkably enhance the image quality in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Half-AVAE: Adversarial-Enhanced Factorized and Structured Encoder-Free VAE for Underdetermined Independent Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study advances the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework by addressing challenges in Independent Component Analysis (ICA) under both determined and underdetermined conditions, focusing on enhancing the independence and interpretability of latent variables. Traditional VAEs map observed data to latent variables and back via an encoder-decoder architecture, but struggle with underdetermined ICA where the number of latent variables exceeds observed signals. The proposed Half Adversarial VAE (Half-AVAE) builds on the encoder-free Half-VAE framework, eliminating explicit inverse mapping to tackle underdetermined scenarios. By integrating adversarial networks and External Enhancement (EE) terms, Half-AVAE promotes mutual independence among latent dimensions, achieving factorized and interpretable representations. Experiments with synthetic signals demonstrate that Half-AVAE outperforms baseline models, including GP-AVAE and Half-VAE, in recovering independent components under underdetermined conditions, as evidenced by lower root mean square errors. The study highlights the flexibility of VAEs in variational inference, showing that encoder omission, combined with adversarial training and structured priors, enables effective solutions for complex ICA tasks, advancing applications in disentanglement, causal inference, and generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Passive Detection in Multi-Static ISAC Systems: Performance Analysis and Joint Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the passive detection problem in multi-static integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where multiple sensing receivers (SRs) jointly detect a target using random unknown communication signals transmitted by a collaborative base station. Unlike traditional active detection, the considered passive detection does not require complete prior knowledge of the transmitted communication signals at each SR. First, we derive a generalized likelihood ratio test detector and conduct an asymptotic analysis of the detection statistic under the large-sample regime. We examine how the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the target paths and direct paths influence the detection performance. Then, we propose two joint transmit beamforming designs based on the analyses. In the first design, the asymptotic detection probability is maximized while satisfying the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirement for each communication user under the total transmit power constraint. Given the non-convex nature of the problem, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm based on the quadratic transform and semi-definite relaxation. The second design adopts a heuristic approach that aims to maximize the target energy, subject to a minimum SNR threshold on the direct path, and offers lower computational complexity. Numerical results validate the asymptotic analysis and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed beamforming designs in balancing passive detection performance and communication quality. This work highlights the promise of target detection using unknown communication data signals in multi-static ISAC systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates energy efficiency maximization for movable antenna (MA)-aided multi-user uplink communication systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption incurred by practical antenna movement. We first examine the special case with a single user and propose an optimization algorithm based on the one-dimensional (1D) exhaustive search to maximize the user's energy efficiency. Moreover, we derive an upper bound on the energy efficiency and analyze the conditions required to achieve this performance bound under different numbers of channel paths. Then, for the general multi-user scenario, we propose an iterative algorithm to fairly maximize the minimum energy efficiency among all users. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving energy efficiency compared to existing MA schemes that do not account for movement-related costs, as well as the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) scheme. In addition, the results show the robustness of the proposed scheme to imperfect channel state information (CSI) and provide valuable insights for practical system deployment.</description>

      <title>Audio synthesizer inversion in symmetric parameter spaces with approximately equivariant flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many audio synthesizers can produce the same signal given different parameter configurations, meaning the inversion from sound to parameters is an inherently ill-posed problem. We show that this is largely due to intrinsic symmetries of the synthesizer, and focus in particular on permutation invariance. First, we demonstrate on a synthetic task that regressing point estimates under permutation symmetry degrades performance, even when using a permutation-invariant loss function or symmetry-breaking heuristics. Then, viewing equivalent solutions as modes of a probability distribution, we show that a conditional generative model substantially improves performance. Further, acknowledging the invariance of the implicit parameter distribution, we find that performance is further improved by using a permutation equivariant continuous normalizing flow. To accommodate intricate symmetries in real synthesizers, we also propose a relaxed equivariance strategy that adaptively discovers relevant symmetries from data. Applying our method to Surge XT, a full-featured open source synthesizer used in real world audio production, we find our method outperforms regression and generative baselines across audio reconstruction metrics.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Empowered Receive Spatial Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA), as an emerging antenna technology, fully exploits spatial diversity. This paper integrates FA with the receive spatial modulation (RSM) scheme and proposes a novel FA-empowered RSM (FA-RSM) system. In this system, the transmitter is equipped with an FA that simultaneously activates multiple ports to transmit precoded signals. We address three key challenges in the FA-RSM system: port selection, theoretical analysis, and detection. First, for port selection, an optimal algorithm from a capacity maximization perspective are proposed, followed by two low-complexity alternatives. Second, for theoretical analysis, performance evaluation metrics are provided for port selection, which demonstrate that increasing the number of activated ports enhances system performance. Third, regarding detection, two low-complexity detectors are proposed. Simulation results confirm that the FA-RSM system significantly outperforms the conventional RSM system. The proposed low-complexity port selection algorithms facilitate minimal performance degradation. Moreover, while activating additional ports improves performance, the gain gradually saturates due to inherent spatial correlation, highlighting the importance of effective port selection in reducing system complexity and cost. Finally, both proposed detectors achieve near-optimal detection performance with low computational complexity, emphasizing the receiver-friendly nature of the FA-RSM system.</description>

      <title>Distributed Image Semantic Communication via Nonlinear Transform Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates distributed source-channel coding for correlated image semantic transmission over wireless channels. In this setup, correlated images at different transmitters are separately encoded and transmitted through dedicated channels for joint recovery at the receiver. We propose a general approach for distributed image semantic communication that applies to both separate source and channel coding (SSCC) and joint source-channel coding (JSCC). Unlike existing learning-based approaches that implicitly learn source correlation in a purely data-driven manner, our method leverages nonlinear transform coding (NTC) to explicitly model source correlation from both probabilistic and geometric perspectives. A joint entropy model approximates the joint distribution of latent representations to guide adaptive rate allocation, while a transformation module aligns latent features for maximal correlation learning at the decoder. We implement this framework as D-NTSC for SSCC and D-NTSCC for JSCC, both built on Swin Transformers for effective feature extraction and correlation exploitation. Variational inference is employed to derive principled loss functions that jointly optimize encoding, decoding, and joint entropy modeling. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that D-NTSC and D-NTSCC outperform existing distributed SSCC and distributed JSCC baselines, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level and perceptual quality metrics.</description>

      <title>Flexible MIMO for Future Wireless Communications: Which Flexibilities are Possible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enable next-generation wireless communication networks with modest spectrum availability, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology needs to undergo further evolution. In this paper, we introduce a promising next-generation wireless communication concept: flexible MIMO technology. This technology represents a MIMO technology with flexible physical configurations and integrated applications. We categorize twelve representative flexible MIMO technologies into three major classifications: flexible deployment characteristics-based, flexible geometry characteristics-based, and flexible real-time modifications-based. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of their fundamental characteristics, potential, and challenges. Furthermore, we demonstrate three vital enablers for the flexible MIMO technology, including efficient channel state information (CSI) acquisition schemes, low-complexity beamforming design, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled optimization. Within these areas, eight critical sub-enabling technologies are discussed in detail. Finally, we present two case studies-pre-optimized irregular arrays and cell-free movable antennas-where significant potential for flexible MIMO technologies to enhance the system capacity is showcased.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Closed-Form Driven Near-Field Flat-Top Beamfocusing with Concentric Circular Vertical Polarized Dipole Array For Large Intelligent Surface Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a near-field flat-top beam synthesis method based on a semi-closed-form approach. First, the feasibility of achieving a flat-top beam in the near field is examined using a closed-form analysis. A circular concentric ring array structure is adopted, and it is observed that circular rings with different radii exhibit distinct gain characteristics along the focal region on the z-axis. Specifically, smaller radii lead to a monotonic increase in electric field strength near the focus, whereas larger radii result in a monotonic decrease. Based on this behavior, parameters such as the number of rings and the initial radius are determined through field superposition. Subsequently, an optimization algorithm is employed to fine-tune the excitation amplitudes of the individual rings in order to suppress sidelobes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through full-wave electromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Optimization for MIMO ISAC Exploiting Prior Information: A PCRB-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) with transceiver hybrid analog-digital arrays transmits dual-functional signals to communicate with a multi-antenna user and simultaneously sense the unknown and random location information of a target based on the reflected echo signals and the prior distribution information on the target's location. Under transceiver hybrid arrays, we characterize the sensing performance by deriving the posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error which is a function of the transmit hybrid beamforming and receive analog beamforming. We study joint transmit hybrid beamforming and receive analog beamforming optimization to minimize the PCRB subject to a communication rate requirement. We first consider a sensing-only system and derive the optimal solution to each element in the transmit/receive analog beamforming matrices that minimizes the PCRB in closed form. Then, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm. Next, we study a narrowband MIMO ISAC system and devise an efficient AO-based hybrid beamforming algorithm by leveraging weighted minimum mean-squared error and feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation methods. Furthermore, we extend the results for narrowband systems to a MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC system. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid beamforming designs. It is revealed that the number of receive RF chains has more significant impact on the sensing performance than its transmit counterpart. Under a given budget on the total number of transmit/receive RF chains at the BS, the optimal number of transmit RF chains increases as the communication rate target increases due to the non-trivial PCRB-rate trade-off.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-RL for Scalable Resource Allocation for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to resource allocation in Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN), leveraging a Generative AI technique with network slicing to address the diverse demands of 5G and 6G service types such as Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC). Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis and comparison of machine learning (ML) techniques for resource allocation within O-RAN, evaluating their effectiveness in optimizing network performance. We introduce a diffusion-based reinforcement learning (Diffusion-RL) algorithm designed to optimize the allocation of physical resource blocks (PRBs) and power consumption, thereby maximizing weighted throughput and minimizing the delay for user equipment (UE). The Diffusion-RL model incorporates controlled noise and perturbations to explore optimal resource distribution while meeting each service type's Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method against several benchmarks, including an exhaustive search algorithm, deep Q-networks (DQN), and the Semi-Supervised Variational Autoencoder (SS-VAE). Comprehensive metrics, such as throughput and latency, are presented for each service type. Experimental results demonstrate that the Diffusion-based RL approach outperforms existing methods in efficiency, scalability, and robustness, offering a promising solution for resource allocation in dynamic and heterogeneous O-RAN environments with significant implications for future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>W4S4: WaLRUS Meets S4 for Long-Range Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful components for sequence modeling, enabling efficient handling of long-range dependencies via linear recurrence and convolutional computation. However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the choice and initialization of the state matrix. In this work, we build on the SaFARi framework and existing WaLRUS SSMs to introduce a new variant, W4S4 (WaLRUS for S4), a new class of SSMs constructed from redundant wavelet frames. WaLRUS admits a stable diagonalization and supports fast kernel computation without requiring low-rank approximations, making it both theoretically grounded and computationally efficient. We show that WaLRUS retains information over long horizons significantly better than HiPPO-based SSMs, both in isolation and when integrated into deep architectures such as S4. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across delay reconstruction tasks, classification benchmarks, and long-range sequence modeling, confirming that high-quality, structured initialization enabled by wavelet-based state dynamic offers substantial advantages over existing alternatives. WaLRUS provides a scalable and versatile foundation for the next generation of deep SSM-based models.</description>

      <title>Packet Header Recognition Utilizing an All-Optical Reservoir Based on Reinforcement-Learning-Optimized Double-Ring Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical packet header recognition is an important signal processing task of optical communication networks. In this work, we propose an all-optical reservoir, consisting of integrated double-ring resonators (DRRs) as nodes, for fast and accurate optical packet header recognition. As the delay-bandwidth product (DBP) of the node is a key figure-of-merit in the reservoir, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the DBPs for various types of DRRs, which has the advantage of full parameter space optimization and fast convergence speed. Intriguingly, the optimized DBPs of the DRRs in cascaded, parallel, and embedded configurations reach the same maximum value, which is believed to be the global maximum. Finally, 3-bit and 6-bit packet header recognition tasks are performed with the all-optical reservoir consisting of the optimized cascaded rings, which have greatly reduced chip size and the desired "flat-top" delay spectra. Using this optical computing scheme, word-error rates as low as 5*10-4 and 9*10-4 are achieved for 3-bit and 6-bit packet header recognition tasks, respectively, which are one order of magnitude better than the previously reported values.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Geometric Graph Neural Networks with Lipschitz Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalization capabilities of geometric graph neural networks (GNNs). We consider GNNs over a geometric graph constructed from a finite set of randomly sampled points over an embedded manifold with topological information captured. We prove a generalization gap between the optimal empirical risk and the optimal statistical risk of this GNN, which decreases with the number of sampled points from the manifold and increases with the dimension of the underlying manifold. This generalization gap ensures that the GNN trained on a graph on a set of sampled points can be utilized to process other unseen graphs constructed from the same underlying manifold. The most important observation is that the generalization capability can be realized with one large graph instead of being limited to the size of the graph as in previous results. The generalization gap is derived based on the non-asymptotic convergence result of a GNN on the sampled graph to the underlying manifold neural networks (MNNs). We verify this theoretical result with experiments on multiple real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Adaptive Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a fundamental technique in array signal processing, beamforming plays a crucial role in amplifying signals of interest (SoI) while mitigating interference plus noise (IPN). When uncertainties exist in the signal model or the data size of snapshots is limited, the performance of beamformers significantly degrades. In this article, we comprehensively study the conceptual system, theoretical analysis, and algorithmic design for robust beamforming against uncertainties in the assumed snapshot or IPN covariances. Since such robustness is specific to the probabilistic uncertainties of snapshots or IPN signals, it is referred to as distributional robustness. Particularly, four technical approaches for distributionally robust beamforming are proposed, including locally distributionally robust beamforming, globally distributionally robust beamforming, regularized beamforming, and Bayesian-nonparametric beamforming. In addition, we investigate the equivalence among the four technical approaches and suggest a unified distributionally robust beamforming framework. Moreover, we show that the resolution of power spectra estimation using distributionally robust beamforming can be greatly refined by incorporating the characteristics of subspace methods, and hence, the accuracy of IPN covariance reconstruction can be improved, especially when the interferers are close to the SoI. As a result, the robustness of beamformers based on IPN covariance estimation can be further enhanced.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of long-term evolution advanced (LTE-A) and fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR), focusing on the effects of Transient Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) caused by catenary-pantograph contact in a railway environment. We developed a software-defined radio (SDR)-based prototype for the performance evaluation of LTE-A and 5G-NR links in the presence of transient interference. The results show that both links experience considerable degradation due to interference at different center frequencies. Performance degradation is proportional to the gain of interference. The measurement results show that both links experience considerable performance degradation in the presence of transient EM interference.</description>

      <title>Multiuser Beamforming for Pinching-Antenna Systems: An Element-wise Optimization Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS) reconstructs wireless channels through pinching beamforming, i.e., optimizing the activated locations of pinching antennas (PAs) along the waveguide. The aim of this article is to investigate the joint design of baseband beamforming and pinching beamforming. A low-complexity element-wise sequential optimization framework is proposed to address the sum-rate maximization problem in PASS-enabled downlink and uplink channels. i) For the downlink scenario, maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming schemes are employed as baseband beamformers. For each beamformer, a closed-form expression for the downlink sum-rate is derived as a single-variable function with respect to the pinching beamformer. Based on this, a sequential optimization method is proposed, where the positions of the PAs are updated element-wise using a low-complexity one-dimensional search. ii) For the uplink scenario, signal detection is performed using maximum ratio combining (MRC), ZF, and MMSE combiners. A closed-form sum-rate expression is derived for each linear combiner, and a similar element-wise design is applied to optimize the pinching beamforming. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate that: (i) For all considered linear beamformers, the proposed PASS architecture outperforms conventional fixed-antenna systems in terms of sum-rate performance; (ii) in both downlink and uplink channels, ZF achieves performance close to that of MMSE and significantly outperforms MRT or MRC; and (iii) the proposed element-wise design eliminates the need for alternating updates between the baseband and pinching beamformers, thereby ensuring low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Uncertainty and Calibration on Likelihood-Ratio Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10686v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a membership inference attack (MIA), an attacker exploits the overconfidence exhibited by typical machine learning models to determine whether a specific data point was used to train a target model. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived analytical bounds predict well the effectiveness of MIAs.</description>

      <title>C3T: Cross-modal Transfer Through Time for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to unlock the potential of diverse sensors, we investigate a method to transfer knowledge between time-series modalities using a multimodal \textit{temporal} representation space for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Specifically, we explore the setting where the modality used in testing has no labeled data during training, which we refer to as Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA). We categorize existing UMA approaches as Student-Teacher or Contrastive Alignment methods. These methods typically compress continuous-time data samples into single latent vectors during alignment, inhibiting their ability to transfer temporal information through real-world temporal distortions. To address this, we introduce Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T), which preserves temporal information during alignment to handle dynamic sensor data better. C3T achieves this by aligning a set of temporal latent vectors across sensing modalities. Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets demonstrate that C3T outperforms existing methods in UMA by at least 8% in accuracy and shows superior robustness to temporal distortions such as time-shift, misalignment, and dilation. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for various multimodal applications.</description>

      <title>A Computational Harmonic Detection Algorithm to Detect Data Leakage through EM Emanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unintended electromagnetic emissions, called EM emanations, can be exploited to recover sensitive information, posing security risks. Metal shielding, used by defense organizations to prevent data leakage, is costly and impractical for widespread use. This issue is particularly significant for IoT devices due to their sheer volume and varied deployment environments. Therefore, there is a research need for an automated detection method to monitor facilities and address data leakage promptly. To resolve this challenge, in the preliminary version of this work [1], a CNN-based detection method was proposed using HDMI cable emanations that provided ~95% accuracy up to 22.5 m but had limitations due to training data. In this extended version, we augment the initial study by collecting and characterizing emanation data from IoT devices, everyday electronics, and cables. We propose a harmonic-based emanation detection method by developing a computational harmonic detection algorithm. The proposed method addresses the limitations of the CNN-based method and provides ~100% accuracy not only for HDMI emanation (compared to ~95% in the earlier CNN method) but also for all other tested devices and cables. Finally, it has also been tested in different environments to prove its efficacy in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Turbo Receiver Design with Joint Detection and Demapping for Coded Differential PSK in Bursty Impulsive Noise Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recognized that the impulsive noise (IN) generated by power devices poses significant challenges to wireless receivers. In this paper, we comprehensively assess the achievable information rate (AIR) for the well-established Markov-Middleton IN model with a phase-shift keying (PSK) input sequence across various channel conditions, including matched and mismatched decoding scenarios. Upon determining information-theoretic bounds, we propose an optimal turbo-DPSK-IN receiver design based on a commonly used commercial transmission setup consisting of a convolutional encoder, bit-level interleaver, and a differential PSK (DPSK) symbol mapper. We show that by incorporating the differential decoder into the maximum a-posteriori-based (MAP) IN detector, we can significantly enhance the receiver performance with a 4.5dB gain compared to the conventional MAP-based PSK-IN receiver and a gap of around 1dB to the theoretical bounds. We also propose a suboptimal separate receiver design that can be implemented with half the complexity of the joint design and near-optimal performance. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed receiver designs through extensive simulations, demonstrating their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with limited interleaver depth and mismatched state implementation.</description>

      <title>Token Communications: A Unified Framework for Cross-modal Context-aware Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a large model-driven framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>MindLLM: A Subject-Agnostic and Versatile Model for fMRI-to-Text Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals into text has been a key challenge in the neuroscience community, with the potential to advance brain-computer interfaces and uncover deeper insights into brain mechanisms. However, existing approaches often struggle with suboptimal predictive performance, limited task variety, and poor generalization across subjects. In response to this, we propose MindLLM, a model designed for subject-agnostic and versatile fMRI-to-text decoding. MindLLM consists of an fMRI encoder and an off-the-shelf LLM. The fMRI encoder employs a neuroscience-informed attention mechanism, which is capable of accommodating subjects with varying input shapes and thus achieves high-performance subject-agnostic decoding. Moreover, we introduce Brain Instruction Tuning (BIT), a novel approach that enhances the model's ability to capture diverse semantic representations from fMRI signals, facilitating more versatile decoding. We evaluate MindLLM on comprehensive fMRI-to-text benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines, improving downstream tasks by 12.0%, unseen subject generalization by 24.5%, and novel task adaptation by 25.0%. Furthermore, the attention patterns in MindLLM provide interpretable insights into its decision-making process.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Rydberg Atomic Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of the quantum technology presents huge opportunities for 6G communications. Leveraging the quantum properties of highly excited Rydberg atoms, Rydberg atom-based antennas present distinct advantages, such as high sensitivity, broad frequency range, and compact size, over traditional antennas. To realize efficient precoding, accurate channel state information is essential. However, due to the distinct characteristics of atomic receivers, traditional channel estimation algorithms developed for conventional receivers are no longer applicable. To this end, we propose a novel channel estimation algorithm based on projection gradient descent (PGD), which is applicable to both one-dimensional (1D) and twodimensional (2D) arrays. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation method.</description>

      <title>Towards Achieving Perfect Multimodal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal alignment constructs a joint latent vector space where modalities representing the same concept map to neighboring latent vectors. We formulate this as an inverse problem and show that, under certain conditions, paired data from each modality can map to equivalent latent vectors, which we refer to as perfect alignment. When perfect alignment cannot be achieved, it can be approximated using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a multimodal data matrix. Experiments on synthetic multimodal Gaussian data verify the effectiveness of our perfect alignment method compared to a learned contrastive alignment method. We further demonstrate the practical application of cross-modal transfer for human action recognition, showing that perfect alignment significantly enhances the model's accuracy. We conclude by discussing how these findings can be applied to various modalities and tasks and the limitations of our method. We hope these findings inspire further exploration of perfect alignment and its applications in representation learning.</description>

      <title>Fast Two-photon Microscopy by Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in neural imaging have enabled neuroscientists to study how large neural populations conspire to produce perception, behavior and cognition. Despite many advances in optical methods, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between imaging speed, field of view, and resolution that limits the scope of neural imaging, especially for the raster-scanning multi-photon imaging needed to image deeper into the brain. One approach to overcoming this trade-off is computational imaging: the co-development of optics designed to encode the target images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, with algorithms that compensate by inverting the optical coding to recover a larger or higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for raster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopy video by subsampling only a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each frame. NORA mitigates the loss of information by 1) extending the point-spread function in the slow-scan direction to effectively integrate the fluorescence of several lines into a single set of measurements and 2) imaging different, randomly selected, lines at each frame. Rather than reconstruct the video frame-by-frame, NORA recovers full video sequences via nuclear-norm minimization on the pixels-by-time matrix, for which we prove theoretical guarantees on recovery. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and Optical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulator, and used the simulations to demonstrate that NORA can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at subsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions. As NORA requires minimal changes to current microscopy systems, our results indicate that NORA can provide a promising avenue towards fast imaging of neural circuits.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Microwave Polarization Switch Implemented with Directed Surface Acoustic Waves in a Magnonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to switch the polarization of a transmitted electromagnetic wave from vertical to horizontal, or vice versa, is of great technological interest because of its many applications in long distance communication. Binary bits can be encoded in two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted securely from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically &gt; 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, we report such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial magnonic crystal". A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, resulting in radiation of electromagnetic waves via magnon-photon coupling. The polarization of the beam radiated in one particular direction at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by switching the direction of SAW propagation in the piezoelectric substrate between two mutually orthogonal directions. By aligning the transmitter and the receiver along that particular direction (known only to authorized users), one can communicate securely from point to point, without the need for encryption or cryptography.</description>
