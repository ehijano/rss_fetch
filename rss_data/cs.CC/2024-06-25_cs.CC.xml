      <title>Computable one-way functions on the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major open problem in computational complexity is the existence of a one-way function, namely a function from strings to strings which is computationally easy to compute but hard to invert. Levin (2023) formulated the notion of one-way functions from reals (infinite bit-sequences) to reals in terms of computability, and asked whether partial computable one-way functions exist. We give a strong positive answer using the hardness of the halting problem and exhibiting a total computable one-way function.</description>

      <title>Formula Size-Depth Tradeoffs for Iterated Sub-Permutation Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formula complexity of Iterated Sub-Permutation Matrix Multiplication, the logspace-complete problem of computing the product of $k$ $n$-by-$n$ Boolean matrices with at most a single $1$ in each row and column. For all $d \le \log k$, this problem is solvable by $n^{O(dk^{1/d})}$ size monotone formulas of two distinct types: (unbounded fan-in) $AC^0$ formulas of depth $d+1$ and (semi-unbounded fan-in) $SAC^0$ formulas of $\bigwedge$-depth $d$ and $\bigwedge$-fan-in $k^{1/d}$. The results of this paper give matching $n^{\Omega(dk^{1/d})}$ lower bounds for monotone $AC^0$ and $SAC^0$ formulas for all $k \le \log\log n$, as well as slightly weaker $n^{\Omega(dk^{1/2d})}$ lower bounds for non-monotone $AC^0$ and $SAC^0$ formulas. These size-depth tradeoffs converge at $d = \log k$ to tight $n^{\Omega(\log k)}$ lower bounds for both unbounded-depth monotone formulas [Ros15] and bounded-depth non-monotone formulas [Ros18]. Our non-monotone lower bounds extend to the more restricted Iterated Permutation Matrix Multiplication problem, improving the previous $n^{k^{1/\exp(O(d))}}$ tradeoff for this problem [BIP98].</description>

      <title>An Invitation to Universality in Physics, Computer Science, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal Turing machine is a powerful concept - a single device can compute any function that is computable. A universal spin model, similarly, is a class of physical systems whose low energy behavior simulates that of any spin system. Our categorical framework for universality (arXiv:2307.06851) captures these and other examples of universality as instances. In this article, we present an accessible account thereof with a focus on its basic ingredients and ways to use it. Specifically, we show how to identify necessary conditions for universality, compare types of universality within each instance, and establish that universality and negation give rise to unreachability (such as uncomputability).</description>

      <title>Consistent Query Answering over SHACL Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16653v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) was standardized by the World Wide Web as a constraint language to describe and validate RDF data graphs. SHACL uses the notion of shapes graph to describe a set of shape constraints paired with targets, that specify which nodes of the RDF graph should satisfy which shapes. An important question in practice is how to handle data graphs that do not validate the shapes graph. A solution is to tolerate the non-validation and find ways to obtain meaningful and correct answers to queries despite the non-validation. This is known as consistent query answering (CQA) and there is extensive literature on CQA in both the database and the KR setting. We study CQA in the context of SHACL for a fundamental fragment of the Semantic Web query language SPARQL. The goal of our work is a detailed complexity analysis of CQA for various semantics and possible restrictions on the acceptable repairs. It turns out that all considered variants of the problem are intractable, with complexities ranging between the first and third level of the polynomial hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Extensively Not P-Bi-Immune promiseBQP-Complete Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I first establish -- via methods other than the Gottesman-Knill theorem -- the existence of an infinite set of instances of simulating a quantum circuit to decide a decision problem that can be simulated classically. I then examine under what restrictions on quantum circuits the existence of infinitely many classically simulable instances persists. There turns out to be a vast number of such restrictions, and any combination of those found can be applied at the same time without eliminating the infinite set of classically simulable instances. Further analysis of the tools used in this then shows there exists a language that every (promise) BQP language is one-one reducible to. This language is also not P-bi-immune under very many promises.</description>

      <title>Constructibility, computational complexity and P versus NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of decision problems related to inconsistency proofs for formal theories is used to show that under a constructive interpretation of computational complexity classes, an assumption referred to as the MW thesis implies that one may explicitly construct decision problems in NP which are not algorithmically solvable. In particular, in this interpretation the MW thesis implies P $\neq$ NP. It is argued that MW is a naturally valid, yet also naturally unformalizable principle.</description>

      <title>Deducibility in the full Lambek calculus with weakening is HAck-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the problem of deciding the consequence relation of the full Lambek calculus with weakening is complete for the class HAck of hyper-Ackermannian problems (i.e., level F_{\omega}^{\omega} of the ordinal-indexed hierarchy of fast-growing complexity classes). Provability was already known to be PSPACE-complete. We prove that deducibility is HAck-complete even for the multiplicative fragment. Lower bounds are proved via a novel reduction from reachability in lossy channel systems and the upper bounds are obtained by combining structural proof theory (forward proof search over sequent calculi) and well-quasi-order theory (length theorems for Higman's Lemma).</description>

      <title>Graph polynomials: some questions on the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We raise some questions about graph polynomials, highlighting concepts and phenomena that may merit consideration in the development of a general theory. Our questions are mainly of three types: When do graph polynomials have reduction relations (simple linear recursions based on local operations), perhaps in a wider class of combinatorial objects? How many levels of reduction relations does a graph polynomial need in order to express it in terms of trivial base cases? For a graph polynomial, how are properties such as equivalence and factorisation reflected in the structure of a graph? We illustrate our discussion with a variety of graph polynomials and other invariants. This leads us to reflect on the historical origins of graph polynomials. We also introduce some new polynomials based on partial colourings of graphs and establish some of their basic properties.</description>

      <title>Imperfect-Recall Games: Equilibrium Concepts and Their Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate optimal decision making under imperfect recall, that is, when an agent forgets information it once held before. An example is the absentminded driver game, as well as team games in which the members have limited communication capabilities. In the framework of extensive-form games with imperfect recall, we analyze the computational complexities of finding equilibria in multiplayer settings across three different solution concepts: Nash, multiselves based on evidential decision theory (EDT), and multiselves based on causal decision theory (CDT). We are interested in both exact and approximate solution computation. As special cases, we consider (1) single-player games, (2) two-player zero-sum games and relationships to maximin values, and (3) games without exogenous stochasticity (chance nodes). We relate these problems to the complexity classes P, PPAD, PLS, $\Sigma_2^P$ , $\exists$R, and $\exists \forall$R.</description>

      <title>An origami Universal Turing Machine design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known since 1996 that deciding whether a collection of creases on a piece of paper can be fully folded flat without causing self-intersection or adding new creases is an NP-Hard problem (Bern and Hayes). In their proof, a binary state was implemented as a pleat, with the state corresponding to the pleat layering order; states then interact via pleat intersections. Building on some of the machinery of their result, we will present a method for constructing an origami NAND logic gate, leading to a theoretical origami Universal Turing Machine.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics of any multiplayer game on regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplayer games on graphs are at the heart of theoretical descriptions of key evolutionary processes that govern vital social and natural systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we solve this by drawing an analogy with the Balls-and-Boxes problem, based on which we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time. As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population. Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs.</description>
