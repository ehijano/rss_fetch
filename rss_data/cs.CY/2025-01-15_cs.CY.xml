      <title>Social Media Data Mining With Natural Language Processing on Public Dream Contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly transformed global lifestyles, enforcing physical isolation and accelerating digital adoption for work, education, and social interaction. This study examines the pandemic's impact on mental health by analyzing dream content shared on the Reddit r/Dreams community. With over 374,000 subscribers, this platform offers a rich dataset for exploring subconscious responses to the pandemic. Using statistical methods, we assess shifts in dream positivity, negativity, and neutrality from the pre-pandemic to post-pandemic era. To enhance our analysis, we fine-tuned the LLaMA 3.1-8B model with labeled data, enabling precise sentiment classification of dream content. Our findings aim to uncover patterns in dream content, providing insights into the psychological effects of the pandemic and its influence on subconscious processes. This research highlights the profound changes in mental landscapes and the role of dreams as indicators of public well-being during unprecedented times.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As trends in education evolve, personalized learning has transformed individuals' engagement with knowledge and skill development. In the digital age, state-of-the-art technologies have been increasingly integrated into classrooms to support intelligent education and foster personalized learning experiences. One promising approach is the use of eye-tracking technology to evaluate student engagement in intelligent virtual classrooms. This paper explores the assessment of personalized learning in the virtual classroom and its impact on student engagement through the eye movement paradigm. The study aims to provide insights into how personalized learning approaches can enhance student participation, motivation, and academic performance in the online learning environment. Through a comprehensive literature review, case study, and data analysis, the paper examines the key elements of personalized learning, the methods of assessment, and the resulting effects on student engagement. The findings suggest that the eye movement paradigm has the potential to assess student engagement and promote better educational outcomes.</description>

      <title>Addressing the sustainable AI trilemma: a case study on LLM agents and RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities, but their widespread deployment and more advanced applications raise critical sustainability challenges, particularly in inference energy consumption. We propose the concept of the Sustainable AI Trilemma, highlighting the tensions between AI capability, digital equity, and environmental sustainability. Through a systematic case study of LLM agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we analyze the energy costs embedded in memory module designs and introduce novel metrics to quantify the trade-offs between energy consumption and system performance. Our experimental results reveal significant energy inefficiencies in current memory-augmented frameworks and demonstrate that resource-constrained environments face disproportionate efficiency penalties. Our findings challenge the prevailing LLM-centric paradigm in agent design and provide practical insights for developing more sustainable AI systems.</description>

      <title>"Near Data" and "Far Data" for Urban Sustainability: How Do Community Advocates Envision Data Intermediaries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the densifying data ecosystem of today's cities, data intermediaries are crucial stakeholders in facilitating data access and use. Community advocates live in these sites of social injustices and opportunities for change. Highly experienced in working with data to enact change, they offer distinctive insights on data practices and tools. This paper examines the unique perspectives that community advocates offer on data intermediaries. Based on interviews with 17 advocates working with 23 grassroots and nonprofit organizations, we propose the quality of "near" and "far" to be seriously considered in data intermediaries' works and articulate advocates' vision of connecting "near data" and "far data." To pursue this vision, we identified three pathways for data intermediaries: align data exploration with ways of storytelling, communicate context and uncertainties, and decenter artifacts for relationship building. These pathways help data intermediaries to put data feminism into practice, surface design opportunities and tensions, and raise key questions for supporting the pursuit of the Right to the City.</description>

      <title>Rethinking AI Cultural Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into society, evaluating their capacity to align with diverse cultural values is crucial for their responsible deployment. Current evaluation methods predominantly rely on multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets. In this study, we demonstrate that MCQs are insufficient for capturing the complexity of cultural values expressed in open-ended scenarios. Our findings highlight significant discrepancies between MCQ-based assessments and the values conveyed in unconstrained interactions. Based on these findings, we recommend moving beyond MCQs to adopt more open-ended, context-specific assessments that better reflect how AI models engage with cultural values in realistic settings.</description>

      <title>An AI-driven framework for rapid and localized optimizations of urban open spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As urbanization accelerates, open spaces are increasingly recognized for their role in enhancing sustainability and well-being, yet they remain underexplored compared to built spaces. This study introduces an AI-driven framework that integrates machine learning models (MLMs) and explainable AI techniques to optimize Sky View Factor (SVF) and visibility, key spatial metrics influencing thermal comfort and perceived safety in urban spaces. Unlike global optimization methods, which are computationally intensive and impractical for localized adjustments, this framework supports incremental design improvements with lower computational costs and greater flexibility. The framework employs SHapley Adaptive Explanations (SHAP) to analyze feature importance and Counterfactual Explanations (CFXs) to propose minimal design changes. Simulations tested five MLMs, identifying XGBoost as the most accurate, with building width, park area, and heights of surrounding buildings as critical for SVF, and distances from southern buildings as key for visibility. Compared to Genetic Algorithms, which required approximately 15/30 minutes across 3/4 generations to converge, the tested CFX approach achieved optimized results in 1 minute with a 5% RMSE error, demonstrating significantly faster performance and suitability for scalable retrofitting strategies. This interpretable and computationally efficient framework advances urban performance optimization, providing data-driven insights and practical retrofitting solutions for enhancing usability and environmental quality across diverse urban contexts.</description>

      <title>Potential and Perils of Large Language Models as Judges of Unstructured Textual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models have unlocked remarkable capabilities when it comes to processing and summarizing unstructured text data. This has implications for the analysis of rich, open-ended datasets, such as survey responses, where LLMs hold the promise of efficiently distilling key themes and sentiments. However, as organizations increasingly turn to these powerful AI systems to make sense of textual feedback, a critical question arises, can we trust LLMs to accurately represent the perspectives contained within these text based datasets? While LLMs excel at generating human-like summaries, there is a risk that their outputs may inadvertently diverge from the true substance of the original responses. Discrepancies between the LLM-generated outputs and the actual themes present in the data could lead to flawed decision-making, with far-reaching consequences for organizations. This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs as judge models to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs. We utilized an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses, with Amazon's Titan Express, Nova Pro, and Meta's Llama serving as LLM judges. The LLM-as-judge approach was compared to human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearman's rho, and Krippendorff's alpha, validating a scalable alternative to traditional human centric evaluation methods. Our findings reveal that while LLMs as judges offer a scalable solution comparable to human raters, humans may still excel at detecting subtle, context-specific nuances. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI assisted text analysis. We discuss limitations and provide recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when generalizing LLM judge models across various contexts and use cases.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Communication with Deep Learning and XAI for Enhanced Arabic Sign Language Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an integrated approach to recognizing Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) using state-of-the-art deep learning models such as MobileNetV3, ResNet50, and EfficientNet-B2. These models are further enhanced by explainable AI (XAI) techniques to boost interpretability. The ArSL2018 and RGB Arabic Alphabets Sign Language (AASL) datasets are employed, with EfficientNet-B2 achieving peak accuracies of 99.48\% and 98.99\%, respectively. Key innovations include sophisticated data augmentation methods to mitigate class imbalance, implementation of stratified 5-fold cross-validation for better generalization, and the use of Grad-CAM for clear model decision transparency. The proposed system not only sets new benchmarks in recognition accuracy but also emphasizes interpretability, making it suitable for applications in healthcare, education, and inclusive communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Assessment and Training in Extended Reality: Multimodal Systems, Clinical Utility, and Current Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) technologies-encompassing virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) are transforming cognitive assessment and training by offering immersive, interactive environments that simulate real-world tasks. XR enhances ecological validity while enabling real-time, multimodal data collection through tools such as galvanic skin response (GSR), electroencephalography (EEG), eye tracking (ET), hand tracking, and body tracking. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive and emotional processes, as well as adaptive, personalized interventions for users. Despite these advancements, current XR applications often underutilize the full potential of multimodal integration, relying primarily on visual and auditory inputs. Challenges such as cybersickness, usability concerns, and accessibility barriers further limit the widespread adoption of XR tools in cognitive science and clinical practice. This review examines XR-based cognitive assessment and training, focusing on its advantages over traditional methods, including ecological validity, engagement, and adaptability. It also explores unresolved challenges such as system usability, cost, and the need for multimodal feedback integration. The review concludes by identifying opportunities for optimizing XR tools to improve cognitive evaluation and rehabilitation outcomes, particularly for diverse populations, including older adults and individuals with cognitive impairments.</description>

      <title>Private Electronic Payments with Self-Custody and Zero-Knowledge Verified Reissuance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article builds upon the protocol for digital transfers described by Goodell, Toliver, and Nakib, which combines privacy by design for consumers with strong compliance enforcement for recipients of payments and self-validating assets that carry their own verifiable provenance information. We extend the protocol to allow for the verification that reissued assets were created in accordance with rules prohibiting the creation of new assets by anyone but the issuer, without exposing information about the circumstances in which the assets were created that could be used to identify the payer. The modified protocol combines an audit log with zero-knowledge proofs, so that a consumer spending an asset can demonstrate that there exists a valid entry on the audit log that is associated with the asset, without specifying which entry it is. This property is important as a means to allow money to be reissued within the system without the involvement of system operators within the zone of control of the original issuer. Additionally, we identify a key property of privacy-respecting electronic payments, wherein the payer is not required to retain secrets arising from one transaction until the following transaction, and argue that this property is essential to framing security requirements for storage of digital assets and the risk of blackmail or coercion as a way to exfiltrate information about payment history. We claim that the design of our protocol strongly protects the anonymity of payers with respect to their payment transactions, while preventing the creation of assets by any party other than the original issuer without destroying assets of equal value.</description>

      <title>Counterfactually Fair Reinforcement Learning via Sequential Data Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When applied in healthcare, reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to dynamically match the right interventions to subjects to maximize population benefit. However, the learned policy may disproportionately allocate efficacious actions to one subpopulation, creating or exacerbating disparities in other socioeconomically-disadvantaged subgroups. These biases tend to occur in multi-stage decision making and can be self-perpetuating, which if unaccounted for could cause serious unintended consequences that limit access to care or treatment benefit. Counterfactual fairness (CF) offers a promising statistical tool grounded in causal inference to formulate and study fairness. In this paper, we propose a general framework for fair sequential decision making. We theoretically characterize the optimal CF policy and prove its stationarity, which greatly simplifies the search for optimal CF policies by leveraging existing RL algorithms. The theory also motivates a sequential data preprocessing algorithm to achieve CF decision making under an additive noise assumption. We prove and then validate our policy learning approach in controlling unfairness and attaining optimal value through simulations. Analysis of a digital health dataset designed to reduce opioid misuse shows that our proposal greatly enhances fair access to counseling.</description>
