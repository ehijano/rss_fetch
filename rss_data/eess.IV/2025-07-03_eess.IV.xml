      <title>Unsupervised Cardiac Video Translation Via Motion Feature Guided Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel motion feature guided diffusion model for unpaired video-to-video translation (MFD-V2V), designed to synthesize dynamic, high-contrast cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) from lower-contrast, artifact-prone displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) CMR sequences. To achieve this, we first introduce a Latent Temporal Multi-Attention (LTMA) registration network that effectively learns more accurate and consistent cardiac motions from cine CMR image videos. A multi-level motion feature guided diffusion model, equipped with a specialized Spatio-Temporal Motion Encoder (STME) to extract fine-grained motion conditioning, is then developed to improve synthesis quality and fidelity. We evaluate our method, MFD-V2V, on a comprehensive cardiac dataset, demonstrating superior performance over the state-of-the-art in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Furthermore, we show the benefits of our synthesized cine CMRs improving downstream clinical and analytical tasks, underscoring the broader impact of our approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/SwaksharDeb/MFD-V2V.</description>

      <title>CineMyoPS: Segmenting Myocardial Pathologies from Cine Cardiac MR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful, acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically, CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss (resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning. Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.</description>

      <title>A robust and versatile deep learning model for prediction of the arterial input function in dynamic small animal $\left[^{18}\text{F}\right]$FDG PET imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures, precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence, extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation. Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.</description>

      <title>3D Heart Reconstruction from Sparse Pose-agnostic 2D Echocardiographic Slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into a personalized 3D heart model.
  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of 5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>MEGANet-W: A Wavelet-Driven Edge-Guided Attention Framework for Weak Boundary Polyp Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to recalibrate semantic features. Our two main contributions are: (1) a two-level Haar wavelet head for multi orientation edge extraction; and (2) Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (WEGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with reverse and input branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANetW consistently outperforms existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while introducing no additional learnable parameters.</description>

      <title>Cross-domain Hyperspectral Image Classification based on Bi-directional Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch) with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches. In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method.

      <title>Determination Of Structural Cracks Using Deep Learning Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.</description>

      <title>A Late Collaborative Perception Framework for 3D Multi-Object and Multi-Source Association and Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy, they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder practical implementation.  To address this issue, we introduce a novel late collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position, and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models.  Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges, setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.</description>

      <title>F^2TTA: Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation on Cross-Domain Medical Image Classification via Image-Level Disentangled Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation (F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT) framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA.

      <title>IGDNet: Zero-Shot Robust Underexposed Image Enhancement via Illumination-Guided and Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images. However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios. Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image, without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR (20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Embedding-Based Federated Data Sharing via Differentially Private Conditional VAEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models, we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.</description>

Abstract: Incurable diseases continue to pose major challenges to global healthcare systems, with their prevalence shaped by lifestyle, economic, social, and genetic factors. Among these, kidney disease remains a critical global health issue, requiring ongoing research to improve early diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, deep learning (DL) has shown promise in medical imaging and diagnostics, driving significant progress in automatic kidney cancer (KC) detection. However, the success of DL models depends heavily on the availability of high-quality, domain-specific datasets, which are often limited and expensive to acquire. Moreover, DL models demand substantial computational power and storage, restricting their real-world clinical use. To overcome these barriers, transfer learning (TL) has emerged as an effective approach, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models from related domains to enhance KC diagnosis. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of DL-based TL frameworks for KC detection, systematically reviewing key methodologies, their advantages, and limitations, and analyzing their practical performance. It further discusses challenges in applying TL to medical imaging and highlights emerging trends that could influence future research. This review demonstrates the transformative role of TL in precision medicine, particularly oncology, by improving diagnostic accuracy, lowering computational demands, and supporting the integration of AI-powered tools in healthcare. The insights provided offer valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners, paving the way for future advances in KC diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Anatomical Foundation Models for Brain MRIs</title>

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the diagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data.

      <title>Bi-modality medical images synthesis by a bi-directional discrete process matching method</title>

Abstract: Recently, medical image synthesis gains more and more popularity, along with the rapid development of generative models. Medical image synthesis aims to generate an unacquired image modality, often from other observed data modalities. Synthesized images can be used for clinical diagnostic assistance, data augmentation for model training and validation or image quality improving. In the meanwhile, the flow-based models are among the successful generative models for the ability of generating realistic and high-quality synthetic images. However, most flow-based models require to calculate flow ordinary different equation (ODE) evolution steps in synthesis process, for which the performances are significantly limited by heavy computation time due to a large number of time iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel flow-based model, namely bi-directional Discrete Process Matching (Bi-DPM) to accomplish the bi-modality image synthesis tasks. Different to other flow matching based models, we propose to utilize both forward and backward ODE flows and enhance the consistency on the intermediate images over a few discrete time steps, resulting in a synthesis process maintaining high-quality generations for both modalities under the guidance of paired data. Our experiments on three datasets of MRI T1/T2 and CT/MRI demonstrate that Bi-DPM outperforms other state-of-the-art flow-based methods for bi-modality image synthesis, delivering higher image quality with accurate anatomical regions.</description>

      <title>Illuminant and light direction estimation using Wasserstein distance method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Illumination estimation remains a pivotal challenge in image processing, particularly for robotics, where robust environmental perception is essential under varying lighting conditions. Traditional approaches, such as RGB histograms and GIST descriptors, often fail in complex scenarios due to their sensitivity to illumination changes. This study introduces a novel method utilizing the Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, to estimate illuminant and light direction in images. Experiments on diverse images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement. Future research may explore adaptive thresholding and integrate gradient analysis to enhance accuracy, offering a scalable solution for real-world illumination challenges in robotics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Understanding-informed Bias Mitigation for Fair CMR Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used for medical imaging tasks. However, there can be biases in AI models, particularly when they are trained using imbalanced training datasets. One such example has been the strong ethnicity bias effect in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation models. Although this phenomenon has been reported in a number of publications, little is known about the effectiveness of bias mitigation algorithms in this domain. We aim to investigate the impact of common bias mitigation methods to address bias between Black and White subjects in AI-based CMR segmentation models. Specifically, we use oversampling, importance reweighing and Group DRO as well as combinations of these techniques to mitigate the ethnicity bias. Second, motivated by recent findings on the root causes of AI-based CMR segmentation bias, we evaluate the same methods using models trained and evaluated on cropped CMR images. We find that bias can be mitigated using oversampling, significantly improving performance for the underrepresented Black subjects whilst not significantly reducing the majority White subjects' performance. Using cropped images increases performance for both ethnicities and reduces the bias, whilst adding oversampling as a bias mitigation technique with cropped images reduces the bias further. When testing the models on an external clinical validation set, we find high segmentation performance and no statistically significant bias.</description>

      <title>Non-rigid Motion Correction for MRI Reconstruction via Coarse-To-Fine Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly susceptible to motion artifacts due to the extended acquisition times required for k-space sampling. These artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging. We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency components are sampled during each motion state.</description>

      <title>VHU-Net: Variational Hadamard U-Net for Body MRI Bias Field Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bias field artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans introduce spatially smooth intensity inhomogeneities that degrade image quality and hinder downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variational Hadamard U-Net (VHU-Net) for effective body MRI bias field correction. The encoder comprises multiple convolutional Hadamard transform blocks (ConvHTBlocks), each integrating convolutional layers with a Hadamard transform (HT) layer. Specifically, the HT layer performs channel-wise frequency decomposition to isolate low-frequency components, while a subsequent scaling layer and semi-soft thresholding mechanism suppress redundant high-frequency noise. To compensate for the HT layer's inability to model inter-channel dependencies, the decoder incorporates an inverse HT-reconstructed transformer block, enabling global, frequency-aware attention for the recovery of spatially consistent bias fields. The stacked decoder ConvHTBlocks further enhance the capacity to reconstruct the underlying ground-truth bias field. Building on the principles of variational inference, we formulate a new evidence lower bound (ELBO) as the training objective, promoting sparsity in the latent space while ensuring accurate bias field estimation. Comprehensive experiments on abdominal and prostate MRI datasets demonstrate the superiority of VHU-Net over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of intensity uniformity, signal fidelity, and tissue contrast. Moreover, the corrected images yield substantial downstream improvements in segmentation accuracy. Our framework offers computational efficiency, interpretability, and robust performance across multi-center datasets, making it suitable for clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>MTCNet: Motion and Topology Consistency Guided Learning for Mitral Valve Segmentationin 4D Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders. Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV) analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features. This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase. Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible. Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD: 1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.</description>

      <title>PAD: Phase-Amplitude Decoupling Fusion for Multi-Modal Land Cover Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and underutilized spectral complementarity. Existing methods often fail to decouple shared structural features from modality-complementary radiometric attributes, causing feature conflicts and information loss. To address this, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-complementary) components in the Fourier domain, thus reinforcing shared structures while preserving complementary characteristics to improve fusion quality. Unlike prior approaches that overlook the distinct physical properties encoded in frequency spectra, PAD is the first to introduce explicit amplitude-phase decoupling for multi-modal fusion. Specifically, PAD comprises two key components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features via convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency; and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high-frequency and low-frequency patterns using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons, leveraging SAR's morphological sensitivity and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing. The code will be available at https://github.com/RanFeng2/PAD.</description>

      <title>Customizable ROI-Based Deep Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users (including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse, ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI. This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module, which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA) mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA) module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.</description>
