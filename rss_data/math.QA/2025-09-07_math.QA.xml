      <title>The principal W-algebra of $\mathfrak{psl}_{2|2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure and representation theory of the principal W-algebra $\mathsf{W}^{\mathsf{k}}_{\mathrm{pr}}$ of $\mathsf{V}^{\mathsf{k}}(\mathfrak{psl}_{2|2})$. The defining operator product expansions are computed, as is the Zhu algebra, and these results are used to classify irreducible highest-weight modules. In particular, for $\mathsf{k} = \pm \frac{1}{2}$, $\mathsf{W}^{\mathsf{k}}_{\mathrm{pr}}$ is not simple and the corresponding simple quotient is the symplectic fermion vertex algebra. We use this fact, along with inverse hamiltonian reduction, to study relaxed highest-weight and logarithmic modules for the small $N=4$ superconformal algebra at central charges $-9$ and $-3$.</description>

      <title>Q-SafeML: Safety Assessment of Quantum Machine Learning via Quantum Distance Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML, existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.</description>

      <title>Quantum group deformations and quantum $ R $-(co)matrices vs. Quantum Duality Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15096v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the effect on quantum groups -- namely, both QUEA's and QFSHA's -- of deformations by twist and by 2-cocycles, showing how such deformations affect the semiclassical limit. As a second, more important task, we discuss how these deformation procedures can be "stretched" to a new extent, via a formal variation of the original recipes, using "polar twists" and "polar 2-cocycles". These recipes seemingly should make no sense at all, yet we prove that they actually work, thus providing well-defined, more general deformation procedures. Later on, we explain the underlying reason that motivates such a result in light of the "Quantum Duality Principle", through which every "polar twist/2-cocycle" for a given quantum group can be seen as a standard twist/2-cocycle for another quantum group, associated to the original one via the appropriate Drinfeld functor. As a third task, we consider standard constructions involving $R$-(co)matrices in the general theory of Hopf algebras. First we adapt them to quantum groups, then we show that they extend to the case of "polar $R$-(co)matrices", and finally we discuss how these constructions interact with the Quantum Duality Principle. As a byproduct, this yields new special symmetries (isomorphisms) for the underlying pair of dual Poisson (formal) groups that one gets by specialization.</description>

      <title>On Harish-Chandra modules over quantizations of nilpotent orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over the complex numbers and $K$ be a connected reductive group mapping to $G$ so that the Lie algebra of $K$ gets identified with a symmetric subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. So we can talk about Harish-Chandra $(\mathfrak{g},K)$-modules, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$. The goal of this paper is to give a geometric classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules with full support over the filtered quantizations of the algebras of the form $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{O}]$, where $\mathbb{O}$ is a nilpotent orbit in $\mathfrak{g}$ with codimension of the boundary at least $4$. Namely, we embed the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules into the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible $K$-equivariant suitably twisted local systems on $\mathbb{O}\cap \mathfrak{k}^\perp$. We show that under certain conditions, for example when $K\subset G$ or when $\mathfrak{g}\cong \mathfrak{so}_n,\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, this embedding is in fact a bijection. On the other hand, for $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_n$ and $K=\operatorname{Spin}_n$, the embedding is not bijective and we give a description of the image. Finally, we perform a partial classification for exceptional Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries and anomalies in quantum lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an 't Hooft anomaly index for a group acting on a 2d quantum lattice system by finite-depth circuits. It takes values in the degree-4 cohomology of the group and is an obstruction to on-siteability of the group action. We introduce a 3-group (modeled as a crossed square) describing higher symmetries of a 2d lattice system and show that the 2d anomaly index is an obstruction for promoting a symmetry action to a morphism of 3-groups. This demonstrates that 't Hooft anomalies are a consequence of a mixing between ordinary symmetries and higher symmetries. Similarly, to any 1d lattice system we attach a 2-group (modeled as a crossed module) and interpret the Nayak-Else anomaly index as an obstruction for promoting a group action to a morphism of 2-groups. The meaning of indices of Symmetry Protected Topological states is also illuminated by higher group symmetry.</description>

      <title>Nesting behind $\hat{Z}$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the spirit of arXiv:2501.12985, we propose an abelian categorification of $\hat{Z}$-invariants for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds. It provides a blueprint for the expected dictionary between these $3$-manifolds and log VOAs; that is, the contribution from 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory via 3d-3d correspondence is encoded as recursive and binary deviations from semisimplicity in the abelian category of modules over the hypothetical log VOA, and is decoded by the recursive application of the theory of Feigin--Tipunin construction. In particular, the nested Weyl-type character formulas provide virtual generalized characters reconstructing the $\hat{Z}$-invariants.</description>
