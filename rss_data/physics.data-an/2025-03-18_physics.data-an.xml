      <title>Ordinal language of antipersistent binary walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the effectiveness of using ordinal pattern probabilities to evaluate antipersistency in the sign decomposition of long-range anti-correlated Gaussian fluctuations. It is numerically shown that ordinal patterns are able to effectively measure both persistent and antipersistent dynamics by analyzing the sign decomposition derived from fractional Gaussian noise. These findings are crucial given that traditional methods such as Detrended Fluctuation Analysis are unsuccessful in detecting anti-correlations in such sequences. The numerical results are supported by physiological and environmental data, illustrating its applicability in real-world situations.</description>

      <title>Proposal for the Application of Fractional Operators in Polynomial Regression Models to Enhance the Determination Coefficient $R^2$ on Unseen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since polynomial regression models are generally quite reliable for data with a linear trend, it is important to note that, in some cases, they may encounter overfitting issues during the training phase, which could result in negative values of the coefficient of determination $R^2$ for unseen data. For this reason, this work proposes the partial implementation of fractional operators in polynomial regression models to generate a fractional regression model. The goal of this proposal is to attempt to mitigate overfitting, which could improve the value of the coefficient of determination for unseen data, compared to the polynomial model, under the assumption that this would contribute to generating predictive models with better performance. The methodology for constructing these fractional regression models is detailed, and examples applicable to both Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional operators are presented.</description>

      <title>Pairwise vs Higher-order interactions: Can we identify the interaction type in coupled oscillators from time series?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhythmic phenomena, which are ubiquitous in biological systems, are typically modelled as systems of coupled limit cycle oscillators. Recently, there has been an increased interest in understanding the impact of higher-order interactions on the population dynamics of coupled oscillators. Meanwhile, estimating a mathematical model from experimental data is a vital step in understanding the dynamics of real-world complex systems. In coupled oscillator systems, identifying the type of interaction (e.g. pairwise or three-body) of a network is challenging, because different interactions can induce similar dynamical states and bifurcations. In this study, we have developed a method based on the adaptive LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) to infer the interactions between the oscillators from time series data. The proposed method can successfully classify the type of interaction and infer the probabilities of the existence of pairwise and three-body couplings. Through systematic analysis of synthetic datasets, we have demonstrated that our method outperforms two baseline methods, LASSO and OLS (Ordinary Least Squares), in accurately inferring the topology and strength of couplings between oscillators. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to the synthetic data of 100 oscillators. These results imply that the proposed method is promising for identifying interactions from rhythmic activities in real-world systems.</description>
