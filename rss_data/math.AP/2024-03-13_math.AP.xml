      <title>On the Ashbaugh-Benguria type conjecture about lower-order Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isoperimetric inequality for lower order nonzero Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in a Euclidean space or a hyperbolic space has been proven in this paper. About this conclusion, we would like to point out two things:
  It strengthens the well-known Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality for nonzero Neumann eigenvalues of the classical free membrane problem given in [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 3 (1954) 343--356] and [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 5 (1956) 633--636];
  Recently, Xia-Wang [Math. Ann. 385 (2023) 863--879] gave a very important progress to the celebrated conjecture of M. S. Ashbaugh and R. D. Benguria proposed in [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 24 (1993) 557--570]. It is easy to see that our conclusion here covers Xia-Wang's this progress as a special case.
  In this paper, we have also proposed two open problems which can be seen as a generalization of Ashbaugh-Benguria's conjecture mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Several isoperimetric inequalities of Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by mainly using the rearrangement technique and suitably constructing trial functions, under the constraint of fixed weighted volume, we can successfully obtain several isoperimetric inequalities for the first and the second Dirichlet eigenvalues, the first nonzero Neumann eigenvalue of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in space forms. These spectral isoperimetric inequalities extend those classical ones (i.e. the Faber-Krahn inequality, the Hong-Krahn-Szeg\H{o} inequality and the Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality) of the Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Nodal solutions to Paneitz-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian manifold $(M^n ,g)$ with a proper isoparametric function $f$ we consider the equation $\Delta^2 u -\alpha \Delta u +\beta u = u^q$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive constants satisfying that $\alpha^2 \geq 4 \beta$. We let ${\bf m}$ be the minimum of the dimensions of the focal varieties of $f$ and $q_f = \frac{n-{\bf m}+4}{n-{\bf m}-4}$, $q_f = \infty$ if $n\leq {\bf m}+4$. We prove the existence of infinitely many nodal solutions of the equation assuming that $1&lt;q&lt;q_f$. The solutions are $f$-invariant. To obtain the result, first we prove a $C^0-$estimate for positive $f$-invariant solutions of the equation. Then we prove the existence of mountain pass solutions with arbitrarily large energy.</description>

      <title>A Darcy law with memory by homogenisation for evolving microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the homogenisation of the instationary Stokes equations in a porous medium with an a-priori given evolving microstructure. In order to pass to the homogenisation limit, we transform the Stokes equations to a domain with a fixed periodic microstructure. The homogenisation result is a Darcy-type equation with memory term and has the form of an integro-differential equation. The evolving microstructure leads to a time and space dependent permeability coefficient and the local change of the porosity causes an additional source term for the pressure.</description>

      <title>On the conservation laws and the structure of the nonlinearity for SQG and its generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a new definition for the nonlinear term, we prove that all weak solutions to the SQG equation (and mSQG) conserve the angular momentum. This result is new for the weak solutions of [Resnick, '95] and rules out the possibility of anomalous dissipation of angular momentum. We also prove conservation of the Hamiltonian under conjecturally optimal assumptions, sharpening a well-known criterion of [Cheskidov-Constantin-Friedlander-Shvydkoy, '08]. Moreover, we show that our new estimate for the nonlinearity is optimal and that it characterizes the mSQG nonlinearity uniquely among active scalar nonlinearities with a scaling symmetry.</description>

      <title>An existence result for accretive growth in elastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a model for the accretive growth of an elastic solid. The reference configuration of the body is accreted in its normal direction, with space- and deformation-dependent accretion rate. The time-dependent reference configuration is identified via the level sets of the unique viscosity solution of a suitable generalized eikonal equation. After proving the global-in-time well-posedness of the quasistatic equilibrium under prescribed growth, we prove the existence of a local-in-time solution for the coupled equilibrium-growth problem, where both mechanical displacement and time-evolving set are unknown. A distinctive challenge is the limited regularity of the growing body, which calls for proving a new uniform Korn inequality.</description>

      <title>Increasing stability for inverse acoustic source problems in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with inverse source problems for the acoustic wave equation in the full space R^3, where the source term is compactly supported in both time and spatial variables. The main goal is to investigate increasing stability for the wave equation in terms of the interval length of given parameters (e.g., bandwith of the temporal component of the source function). We establish increasing stability estimates of the L^2 -norm of the source function by using only the Dirichlet boundary data. Our method relies on the Huygens principle, the Fourier transform and explicit bounds for the continuation of analytic functions.</description>

      <title>$L^2$ decay for large perturbations of viscous shocks for multi-D Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a planar viscous shock of moderate strength for a scalar viscous conservation law in multi-D. We consider a strictly convex flux, as a small perturbation of the Burgers flux, along the normal direction to the shock front. However, for the transversal directions, we do not have any restrictions on flux function. We first show the contraction property for any large perturbations in $L^2$ of the planar viscous shock. If the initial $L^2$-perturbation is also in $L^1$, the large perturbation converges to zero in $L^2$ as time goes to infinity with $t^{-1/4}$ decay rate. The contraction and decay estimates hold up to dynamical shift. For the results, we do not impose any smallness conditions on the initial value. This result extends the 1D case \cite{Kang-V-1} by the first author and Vasseur to the multi-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Increasing stability for inverse source problem with limited-aperture far field data at multi-frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the increasing stability of an inverse source problem for the Helmholtz equation from limited-aperture far field data at multiple wave numbers. The measurement data are givenby the far field patterns $u^\infity(\hat{x},k)$ for all observation directions in some neighborhood of a fixed direction $\hat{x}$ and for all wave numbers k belonging to a finite interval $(0,K)$. In this paper, we discuss the increasing stability with respect to the width of the wavenumber interval $K&gt;1$. In three dimensions we establish stability estimates of the $L^2$-norm and $H^{-1}$-norm of the source function from the far field data. The ill-posedness of the inverse source problem turns out to be of H\"older type while increasing the wavenumber band K. We also discuss an analytic continuation argument of the far-field data with respect to the wavenumbers at a fixed direction.</description>

      <title>Colloidal Homogenisation for the Hydrodynamics of Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analytically explores a simplified model for the hydrodynamics of nematic liquid crystal colloids. We integrate a Stokes equation for the velocity field with a Ginzburg-Landau transported heat flow for the director field. The study focuses on a bounded spatial domain containing periodically distributed colloidal particles, which impose no-anchoring conditions on the nematic liquid crystal. By progressively reducing the particle size to zero and simultaneously increasing the number of particles, we delve into the associated homogenisation problem. Our analysis uncovers a form of decoupling where the velocity field asymptotically satisfies a Darcy equation, independent of the director, while the director follows a gradient flow, unaffected by the velocity field. One of the most intricate aspects of the homogenisation process is the absence of an extension operator for the director field that preserves the uniform estimates related to the system's energy. We address this challenge with a novel variation of the Aubin-Lions lemma, specifically adapted for homogenisation problems.</description>

      <title>Higher order Schauder estimates for parabolic equations with degenerate or singular weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the analysis initiated in [AFV24] establishing some higher order $C^{k+2,\alpha}$ Schauder estimates ($k \in \mathbb{N}$) for a a class of parabolic equations with weights that are degenerate/singular on a characteristic hyperplane. The $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimates are obtained through a blow-up argument and a Liouville theorem, while the higher order estimates are obtained by a fine iteration procedure. As a byproduct, we present two applications. First, we prove similar Schauder estimates when the degeneracy/singularity of the weight occurs on a regular hypersurface of cylindrical type. Second, we provide an alternative proof of the higher order boundary Harnack principles established in [BG16,Kuk22].</description>

      <title>Global solutions of the one-dimensional compressible Euler equations with nonlocal interactions via the inviscid limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the global existence of finite-energy entropy solutions of the one-dimensional compressible Euler equations with (possibly) damping, alignment forces, and nonlocal interactions: Newtonian repulsion and quadratic confinement. Both the polytropic gas law and the general gas law are analyzed. This is achieved by constructing a sequence of solutions of the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-type equations with density-dependent viscosity under the stress-free boundary condition and then taking the vanishing viscosity limit. The main difficulties in this paper arise from the appearance of the nonlocal terms. In particular, some uniform higher moment estimates for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on expanding intervals with stress-free boundary conditions are obtained by careful design of the approximate initial data.</description>

      <title>On the Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic models with nonlocal look-ahead interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new family of second-order traffic flow models, extending the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model to incorporate nonlocal interactions. Our model includes a specific nonlocal Arrhenius-type look-ahead slowdown factor. We establish both local and global well-posedness theories for these nonlocal ARZ models.
  In contrast to the local ARZ model, where generic smooth initial data typically lead to finite-time shock formation, we show that our nonlocal ARZ model exhibits global regularity for a class of smooth subcritical initial data. Our result highlights the potential of nonlocal interactions to mitigate shock formations in second-order traffic flow models.
  Our analytical approach relies on investigating phase plane dynamics. We introduce a novel comparison principle based on a mediant inequality to effectively handle the nonlocal information inherent in our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the microlocal regularity of the analytic/Gevrey vectors for the following class of second order partial differential equations \begin{align*}
  P(x,D) = \sum_{\ell,j=1}^{n} a_{\ell,j}(x) D_{\ell} D_{j} + \sum_{\ell=1}^{n} i b_{\ell}(x) D_{\ell} +c(x), \end{align*} where $a_{\ell,j}(x) = a_{j,\ell}(x)$, $b_{\ell}(x)$, $\ell,j \in \lbrace 1,\dots,\, n\rbrace$, are real valued real Gevrey functions of order $s$ and $c(x)$ is a Gevrey function of order $s$, $s \geq 1$, on $\Omega$ open neighborhood of the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Thus providing a microlocal version of a result due to M.

      <description>arXiv:2403.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the null controllability of a one-dimensional fourth-order degenerate parabolic equation with a singular potential. Here, we analyze cases where boundary control conditions are applied at the left endpoint. We utilize a spectral decomposition involving Bessel functions and their zeros in a convenient weighted Sobolev space for a degenerate parabolic operator with specific boundary conditions. We establish the well-posedness of the system using semigroup operator theory. Subsequently, we employ the moment method by Fattorini and Russell to obtain an upper estimate of the cost of controllability. Additionally, we derive a lower estimate of the cost of controllability using a representation theorem for analytic functions of exponential type.</description>

      <title>A Computational Method for $H_2$-optimal Estimator and State Feedback Controller Synthesis for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present solvable, convex formulations of $H_2$-optimal state estimation and state-feedback control problems for a general class of linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with one spatial dimension. These convex formulations are derived by using an analysis and control framework called the `Partial Integral Equation' (PIE) framework, which utilizes the PIE representation of infinite-dimensional systems. Since PIEs are parameterized by Partial Integral (PI) operators that form an algebra, $H_2$-optimal estimation and control problems for PIEs can be formulated as Linear PI Inequalities (LPIs). Furthermore, if a PDE admits a PIE representation, then the stability and $H_2$ performance of the PIE system implies that of the PDE system. Consequently, the optimal estimator and controller obtained for a PIE using LPIs provide the same stability and performance when applied to the corresponding PDE. These LPI optimization problems can be solved computationally using semi-definite programming solvers because such problems can be formulated using Linear Matrix Inequalities by using positive matrices to parameterize a cone of positive PI operators. We illustrate the application of these methods by constructing observers and controllers for some standard PDE examples.</description>

      <title>Non-linear collision-induced breakage equation: finite volume and semi-analytical methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-linear collision-induced breakage equation has significant applications in particulate processes. Two semi-analytical techniques, namely homotopy analysis method (HAM) and accelerated homotopy perturbation method (AHPM) are investigated along with the well-known finite volume method (FVM) to comprehend the dynamical behavior of the non-linear system, i.e., the concentration function, the total number and the total mass of the particles in the system. The theoretical convergence analyses of the series solutions of HAM and AHPM are discussed. In addition, the error estimations of the truncated solutions of both methods equip the maximum absolute error bound. To justify the applicability and accuracy of these methods, numerical simulations are compared with the findings of FVM and analytical solutions considering three physical problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to provide approximate solutions for the non-linear collision-induced breakage equation using two different semi-analytical schemes, i.e., variational iteration method (VIM) and optimized decomposition method (ODM). The study also includes the detailed convergence analysis and error estimation for ODM in the case of product collisional ($K(\epsilon,\rho)=\epsilon\rho$) and breakage ($b(\epsilon,\rho,\sigma)=\frac{2}{\rho}$) kernels with an exponential decay initial condition. By contrasting estimated concentration function and moments with exact solutions, the novelty of the suggested approaches is presented considering three numerical examples. Interestingly, in one case, VIM provides a closed-form solution, however, finite term series solutions obtained via both schemes supply a great approximation for the concentration function and moments.</description>

      <title>Environmental Averaging</title>

Abstract: Many classical examples of models of self-organized dynamics, including the Cucker-Smale, Motsch-Tadmor, multi-species, and several others, include an alignment force that is based upon density-weighted averaging protocol. Those protocols can be viewed as special cases of `environmental averaging'. In this paper we formalize this concept and introduce a unified framework for systematic analysis of alignment models.
  A series of studies are presented including the mean-field limit in deterministic and stochastic settings, hydrodynamic limits in the monokinetic and Maxwellian regimes, hypocoercivity and global relaxation for dissipative kinetic models, several general alignment results based on chain connectivity and spectral gap analysis. These studies cover many of the known results and reveal new ones, which include asymptotic alignment criteria based on connectivity conditions, new estimates on the spectral gap of the alignment force that do not rely on the upper bound of the macroscopic density, uniform gain of positivity for solutions of the Fokker-Planck-Alignment model based on smooth environmental averaging. As a consequence, we establish unconditional relaxation result for global solutions to the Fokker-Planck-Alignment model, which presents a substantial improvement over previously known perturbative results.</description>

      <title>Global Finite-Energy Solutions of the Compressible Euler-Poisson Equations for General Pressure Laws with Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with global finite-energy solutions of the three-dimensional compressible Euler-Poisson equations with gravitational potential and general pressure law, especially including the constitutive equation of white dwarf stars. We construct global finite-energy solutions of the Cauchy problem for the Euler-Poisson equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry as the inviscid limit of the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing viscosity solutions is achieved through entropy analysis, uniform estimates in $L^p$, and a more general compensated compactness framework via several new ingredients. A key estimate is first established for the integrability of the density over unbounded domains independent of the viscosity coefficient. Then a special entropy pair is carefully designed by solving a Goursat problem for the entropy equation such that a higher integrability of the velocity is established, which is a crucial step. Moreover, the weak entropy kernel for the general pressure law and its fractional derivatives of the required order near vacuum ($\rho=0$) and far-field ($\rho=\infty$) are carefully analyzed. Owing to the generality of the pressure law, only the $W^{-1,p}_{{\rm loc}}$-compactness of weak entropy dissipation measures with $p\in [1,2)$ can be obtained; this is rescued by the equi-integrability of weak entropy pairs which can be established by the estimates obtained above so that the div-curl lemma still applies. Finally, based on the above analysis of weak entropy pairs, the $L^p$ compensated compactness framework for the compressible Euler equations with general pressure law is established. This new compensated compactness framework and the techniques developed in this paper should be useful for solving further nonlinear problems with similar features.</description>

Abstract: The three-dimensional generalized tropical climate model with partial viscosity and damping is considered in this paper. Global well-posedness of solutions of the three-dimensional generalized tropical climate model with partial viscosity and damping is proved for $\alpha\geq\frac{3}{2}$ and $\beta\geq4$.

      <title>Boundary Output Feedback Stabilization for a Novel Magnetizable Piezoelectric Beam Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13986v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A magnetizable piezoelectric beam model, free at both ends, is considered. Piezoelectric materials have a strong interaction of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, whose wave propagation speeds differ substantially. The corresponding strongly-coupled PDE model describes the longitudinal vibrations and the total charge accumulation at the electrodes of the beam. It is known that the PDE model with appropriately chosen collocated state feedback controllers is known to have exponentially stable solutions. However, the collocated controller design is not always feasible since the performance of controllers may not be good enough, and moreover, a small increment of feedback controller gains can easily make the closed-loop system unstable. Therefore, a non-collocated controller and observer design is considered for the first time for this model. In particular, two state feedback controllers are designed at the right end to recover the states so that the boundary output feedback controllers can be designed as a replacement of the states with the estimate from the observers on the left end. By a carefully-constructed Lyapunov function, it is proved that the both the observer and the observer error dynamics have uniformly exponential stable solutions. This framework offers a substantial foundation for the model reductions by Finite Differences.</description>

      <title>Existence of martingale solutions to a nonlinearly coupled stochastic fluid-structure interaction problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a nonlinear stochastic fluid-structure interaction problem with a multiplicative, white-in-time noise. The problem consists of the Navier-Stokes equations describing the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid in a 2D cylinder interacting with an elastic lateral wall whose elastodynamics is described by a membrane/shell equation. The flow is driven by the inlet and outlet data, and by the stochastic forcing. The stochastic noise is applied both to the fluid equations as a volumetric body force, and to the structure as an external forcing to the deformable fluid boundary. The fluid and the structure are nonlinearly coupled via the kinematic and dynamic conditions assumed at the moving interface, which is a random variable not known a priori. The geometric nonlinearity due to the nonlinear coupling requires the development of new techniques to capture martingale solutions for this class of stochastic fluid-structure interaction problems. We introduce a constructive approach based on a Lie splitting scheme and prove the existence of martingale solutions to the system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result in the field of stochastic PDEs that addresses existence of solutions on moving fluid domains involving incompressible viscous fluids, where the displacement of the boundary and the fluid domain are random variables that are not known a priori and are parts of the solution itself.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Two-scale System with Nonlinear Dispersion: Weak Solvability and Numerical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a two-scale system featuring an upscaled parabolic dispersion-reaction equation intimately linked to a family of elliptic cell problems. The system is strongly coupled through a dispersion tensor, which depends on the solutions to the cell problems, and via the cell problems themselves, where the solution of the parabolic problem interacts nonlinearly with the drift term. This particular mathematical structure is motivated by a rigorously derived upscaled reaction-diffusion-convection model that describes the evolution of a population of interacting particles pushed by a large drift through an array of periodically placed obstacles (i.e., through a regular porous medium).
  We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to our system by means of an iterative scheme, where particular care is needed to ensure the uniform positivity of the dispersion tensor. Additionally, we use finite element-based approximations for the same iteration scheme to perform multiple simulation studies. Finally, we highlight how the choice of micro-geometry (building the regular porous medium) and of the nonlinear drift coupling affects the macroscopic dispersion of particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of some controllability issues for the forward stochastic parabolic equation with dynamic boundary conditions. The main novelty in the present paper consists of considering only one control without extra forces in the noise parts. Utilizing an adequate spectral inequality and the iterative Lebeau-Robiano strategy, we first establish an observability inequality for the corresponding adjoint backward stochastic system. The null controllability result is then established by the classical duality approach. As a consequence of the null controllability property, an approximate controllability result is proved.</description>

      <title>Large deformations in terms of stretch and rotation and local solution to the non-stationary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider and generalize a model, recently proposed and analytically investigated in its quasi-stationary approximation by the authors, for visco-elasticity with large deformations and conditional compatibility, where the independent variables are the stretch and the rotation tensors. The model takes the form of a system of integro-differential coupled equations. Here, its derivation is generalized to consider mixed boundary conditions, which may represent a wider range of physical applications then the case with Dirichlet boundary conditions considered in our previous contribution. This also introduces nontrivial technical difficulties in the theoretical framework, related to the definition and the regularity of the solutions of elliptic operators with mixed boundary conditions. As a novel contribution, we develop the analysis of the fully non-stationary version of the system where we consider inertia. In this context, we prove the existence of a local in time weak solution in three space dimensions, employing techniques from PDEs and convex analysis.</description>

Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, we discuss the relation between the solvability of Schiffer's overdetermined problem and the optimality, among sets of prescribed area, of the first eigenvalue in the buckling problem for a clamped plate and that of the first eigenvalue of the Stokes operator. For the latter, we deduce that the minimisers under area constraint that are smooth and simply connected must be discs from the fact that a pressureless velocity is a necessary condition of optimality.</description>

      <title>On $\kappa$-solutions and canonical neighborhoods in 4d Ricci flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classification conjecture for $\kappa$-solutions in 4d Ricci flow. Our conjectured list includes known examples from the literature, but also a new 1-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2\times \mathrm{O}_3$-symmetric bubble-sheet ovals that we construct. We observe that some special cases of the conjecture follow from recent results in the literature. We also introduce a stronger variant of the classification conjecture for ancient asymptotically cylindrical 4d Ricci flows, which does not assume smoothness and nonnegative curvature operator a priori. Assuming this stronger variant holds true, we establish a canonical neighborhood theorem for 4d Ricci flow through cylindrical singularities, which shares some elements in common with Perelman's canonical neighborhood theorem for 3d Ricci flow as well as the mean-convex neighborhood theorem for mean curvature flow through neck-singularities. Finally, we argue that quotient-necks lead to new phenomena, and sketch an example of non-uniqueness for 4d Ricci flow through singularities.</description>

      <title>Shape Optimization of hemolysis for shear thinning flows in moving domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the $3$D problem of shape optimization of blood flows in moving domains. Such a geometry is adopted to take into account the modeling of rotating systems and blood pumps for instance. The blood flow is described by generalized Navier-Stokes equations, in the particular case of shear-thinning flows. For a sequence of converging moving domains, we show that a sequence of associated solutions to blood equations converges to a solution of the problem written on the limit moving domain. Thus, we extended the result given in (Soko\l{}owski, Stebel, 2014, in \textit{Evol. Eq. Control Theory}) for $q \geq 11/5$, to the range $6/5&lt; q &lt; 11/5$, where $q$ is the exponent of the rheological law. This shape continuity property allows us to show the existence of minimal shapes for a class of functionals depending on the blood velocity field and its gradient. This allows to consider in particular the problem of hemolysis minimization in blood flows, namely the minimization of red blood cells damage.</description>

      <title>The Exponential Stabilization of a Heat and Piezoelectric Beam Interaction with Static or Hybrid Feedback Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates a strongly-coupled system of partial differential equations (PDE) governing heat transfer in a copper rod, longitudinal vibrations, and total charge accumulation at electrodes within a magnetizable piezoelectric beam. Conducted within the transmission line framework, the analysis reveals profound interactions between traveling electromagnetic and mechanical waves in magnetizable piezoelectric beams, despite disparities in their velocities. Findings suggest that in the open-loop scenario, the interaction of heat and beam dynamics lacks exponential stability solely considering thermal effects. To confront this challenge, two types of boundary-type state feedback controllers are proposed: (i) employing static feedback controllers entirely and (ii) adopting a hybrid approach wherein the electrical controller dynamically enhances system dynamics. In both cases, solutions of the PDE systems demonstrate exponential stability through meticulously formulated Lyapunov functions with diverse multipliers. The proposed proof technique establishes a robust foundation for demonstrating the exponential stability of Finite-Difference-based model reductions as the discretization parameter approaches zero.</description>
