      <title>Ketonen's question and other cardinal sins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intersection models of generic extensions obtained from a commutative projection systems of notions of forcing has recently regained interest, especially in the study of descriptive set theory. Here, we show that it provides a fruitful framework that opens the door to solving some open problems concerning compactness principles of small cardinals. To exemplify, from suitable assumptions, we construct intersection models satisfying ZFC and any of the following:
  1. There is a weakly compact cardinal $\kappa$ carrying an indecomposable ultrafilter, yet $\kappa$ is not measurable. This answers a question of Ketonen from the late 1970's.
  2. For proper class many cardinals $\lambda$, the least $\lambda$-strongly compact cardinal is singular. This answers a question of Bagaria and Magidor who asked for merely two such cardinals.
  3. There is a strongly inaccessible cardinal whose $C$-sequence number is a singular cardinal. This answers a question of Lambie-Hanson and the first author.</description>

      <title>Reasoning from hypotheses in *-continuous action lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of all $\ast$-continuous Kleene algebras, whose description includes an infinitary condition on the iteration operator, plays an important role in computer science. The complexity of reasoning in such algebras - ranging from the equational theory to the Horn one, with restricted fragments of the latter in between - was analyzed by Kozen (2002). This paper deals with similar problems for $\ast$-continuous residuated Kleene lattices, also called $\ast$-continuous action lattices, where the product operation is augmented by adding residuals. We prove that in the presence of residuals the fragment of the corresponding Horn theory with $\ast$-free hypotheses has the same complexity as the $\omega^\omega$ iteration of the halting problem, and hence is properly hyperarithmetical. We also prove that if only commutativity conditions are allowed as hypotheses, then the complexity drops down to $\Pi^0_1$ (i.e. the complement of the halting problem), which is the same as that for $\ast$-continuous Kleene algebras. In fact, we get stronger upper bound results: the fragments under consideration are translated into suitable fragments of infinitary action logic with exponentiation, and the upper bounds are obtained for the latter ones.</description>

      <title>Meta-Modelling in Formal Concept Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis starts from a very basic data structure comprising objects and their attributes. Sometimes, however, it is beneficial to also define attributes of attributes (so-called meta-attributes). In this paper, we use Triadic Formal Concept Analysis(a triadic approach to Formal Concept Analysis) to develop a framework for this kind of meta-modelling in Formal Concept Analysis, including formal definitions and appropriate visualizations.</description>

      <title>Preservation of Topological Properties by Strongly Proper Forcings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that forcings which are strongly proper for stationarily many countable elementary submodels preserve each of the following properties of topological spaces: countably tight; Lindel\"of; Rothberger; Menger; and a strategic version of Rothberger. This extends results from Dow, as well as from Iwasa and from Kada.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Galois theory and an analogue of the Kronecker--Weber theorem for rational function fields over ultra-finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we develop a general framework that permits a comparison between explicit class field theories for a family of rational function fields $\mathbb{F}_s(t)$ over arbitrary constant fields $\mathbb{F}_s$ and explicit class field theory for the rational function field $\mathfrak{K}(t)$ over the nonprincipal ultraproduct $\mathfrak{K}$ of the constant fields $\mathbb{F}_s$. Under an additional assumption that the constant fields $\mathbb{F}_s$ are perfect procyclic fields, we prove a correspondence between ramifications of primes $P$ in $\mathfrak{K}(t)$ and ramifications of primes $P_s$ in $\mathbb{F}_s(t)$, where the $P_s$ are primes in $\mathbb{F}_s(t)$ whose nonprincipal ultraproduct coincides with $P$.
  In the second part of the paper, we are mainly concerned with rational function fields over a large class of fields, called $n$-th level ultra-finite fields that are a generalization of finite fields. At the $0$-th level, ultra-finite fields are simply finite fields, and for an arbitrary positive integer $n$, an $n$-th level ultra-finite field is inductively defined as a nonprincipal ultraproduct of $(n - 1)$-th level ultra-finite fields. We develop an analogue of cyclotomic function fields for rational function fields over $n$-th level ultra-finite fields that generalize the works of Carlitz and Hayes for rational function fields over finite fields such that these cyclotomic function fields are in complete analogy with the classical cyclotomic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ of the rationals $\mathbb{Q}$. The main result in the second part of the paper is an analogue of the Kronecker--Weber theorem for rational function fields over $n$-th level ultra-finite fields that explicitly describes, from a model-theoretic viewpoint, the maximal abelian extension of the rational function field over a given $n$-th level ultra-finite field for all $n \ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Some Property of an Ultrafilter and Graph parameters on Connectivity System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ultrafilter is a maximal filter on a set, playing a crucial role in set theory and topology for rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X, f), where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters helps to elucidate the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth.</description>

      <title>Discrete sets definable in strong expansions of ordered Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06929v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of infinite discrete sets D definable in expansions of ordered Abelian groups whose theories are strong and definably complete, with particular emphasis on the set D' comprised of differences between successive elements. In particular, if the burden of the structure is at most n, then the result of applying the operation taking D to D' n times must be a finite set (Theorem 1.1). In the case when the structure is densely ordered and has burden 2, we show that any definable unary discrete set must be definable in some elementary extension of the structure (R; &lt;, +, Z) (Theorem 1.3).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a combinatorial game on $\omega_1$ and show that mild large cardinal assumptions imply that every normal ideal on $\omega_1$ satisfies a weak version of precipitousness. As an application, we show that that the Raghavan-Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} proof of a longstanding conjecture of Galvin (done assuming the existence of a Woodin cardinal) can be pushed through under much weaker large cardinal assumptions.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Resilience Problems via Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) constitute a large class of computational optimisation problems. It was shown recently that, over finite domains, every VCSP is in P or NP-complete, depending on the admitted cost functions. In this article, we study cost functions over countably infinite domains whose automorphisms form an oligomorphic permutation group. Our results include a hardness condition based on a generalisation of pp-constructability as known from classical CSPs and a polynomial-time tractability condition based on the concept of fractional polymorphisms. We then observe that the resilience problem for unions of conjunctive queries (UCQs) studied in database theory, under bag semantics, may be viewed as a special case of the VCSPs that we consider. We obtain a complexity dichotomy for the case of incidence-acyclic UCQs and exemplarily use our methods to determine the complexity of a query that had remained open in the literature. Further, we conjecture that our hardness and tractability conditions match for resilience problems for UCQs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the Wajsberg-center and the OML-center of a quantum-Wajsberg algebra, and study their structures. We prove that the Wajsberg-center is a Wajsberg subalgebra of a quantum-Wajsberg algebra, and that it is a distributive sublattice of its corresponding poset. If the quantum-Wajsberg algebra is quasi-linear, we show that the Wajsberg-center is a linearly ordered Wajsberg algebra. We also show that the lattice subreduct of the Wajsberg-center is a Kleene algebra. Furthermore, we prove that the OML-center is an orthomodular lattice, and the orthomodular lattices form a subvariety of the variety of quantum-Wajsberg algebras.</description>

      <title>Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture and big Ramsey degrees of structures admitting finite monomorphic decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a countable structure admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if so does every monomorphic part in its minimal monomorphic decomposition. The necessary prerequisite for this result is the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees: a countable monomorphic structure has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if it is chainable by a chain with finite big Ramsey degrees. Interestingly, both characterizations require deep structural properties of chains. Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture (actually, its positive resolution due to Laver) is instrumental in the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, while the analysis of big Ramsey combinatorics of structures admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition requires a product Ramsey theorem for big Ramsey degrees. We find this last result particularly intriguing because big Ramsey degrees misbehave notoriously when it comes to general product statements.</description>

      <title>Cartesian closed varieties II: links to algebra and self-similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series investigating cartesian closed varieties. In first of these, we showed that every non-degenerate finitary cartesian variety is a variety of sets equipped with an action by a Boolean algebra B and a monoid M which interact to form what we call a matched pair [B|M]. In this paper, we show that such pairs [B|M] are equivalent to Boolean restriction monoids and also to ample source-\'etale topological categories; these are generalisations of the Boolean inverse monoids and ample \'etale topological groupoids used to encode self-similar structures such as Cuntz and Cuntz--Krieger $C^\ast$-algebras, Leavitt path algebras and the $C^\ast$-algebras associated to self-similar group actions. We explain and illustrate these links, and begin the programme of understanding how topological and algebraic properties of such groupoids can be understood from the logical perspective of the associated varieties.</description>

      <title>High-arity PAC learning via exchangeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of high-arity PAC learning, which is statistical learning in the presence of "structured correlation". In this theory, hypotheses are either graphs, hypergraphs or, more generally, structures in finite relational languages, and i.i.d. sampling is replaced by sampling an induced substructure, producing an exchangeable distribution. Our main theorems establish a high-arity (agnostic) version of the fundamental theorem of statistical learning.</description>
