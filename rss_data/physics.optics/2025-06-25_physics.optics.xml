      <title>Absence of reflectivity of the phonon-polariton at the SiC surface from the metal mask edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface phonon polariton (SPhP) waves are excited at the silicon carbide ($SiC$) surface under irradiation of light close to the lattice resonance frequency. Metal mask at the surface blocks irradiation of certain areas and thus allows tuning standing or propagating wave pattern and, thus, open opportunities for surface polariton optic devices. In this study we show by means of scanning near-field microscopy that the edge of such a mask reflects SPhP waves negligibly. This condition differs dramatically from numerous recent observations of polariton reflections in 2D materials and makes the metallized $SiC$ platform advantageous in a sense of capability to calculate wavefield using a simple Green function-based approach.</description>

      <title>Carrier Transport in Electrically-Driven Photonic Crystal Membrane Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model carrier transport in photonic crystal lasers with lateral current injection through two-dimensional (2D) finite-volume simulations. Though such lasers can achieve ultra-low threshold currents, leakage paths reduce the carrier injection efficiency. The design is evaluated through its performance in terms of injection efficiency, internal quantum efficiency, and IV characteristics. Our model predicts the presence of unconventional leakage paths, explaining experimental observations of low injection efficiencies and enhanced spontaneous recombination at doping interfaces. Carrier leakage paths arise due to insufficient injection of holes into the active region, leading to an electric field that increases the energy barrier for electrons, reducing the injection efficiency. The profile of the p-doped region is shown to play a critical role in achieving a high electrical injection efficiency and low-threshold lasing. The model is an important step towards modelling and optimizing properties of 2D photonic crystal membrane lasers.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of the radiation-matter interaction quantum systems through the time-dependent Schr\"odinger dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining exact solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation in complex quantum systems poses significant challenges. In this context, numerical methods emerge as valuable tools for analyzing such systems. This article proposes a numerical approach using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, implemented in Python, to tackle radiation-matter interaction systems. This methodology is applicable to various Hamiltonians, including that of the Jaynes-Cummings model. The accuracy of the numerical results is validated by comparing them with analytical solutions in simplified cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in studying quantum systems where exact solutions cannot be derived.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of the Lindblad master equation using the Runge-Kutta method implemented in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of open quantum systems is governed by the Lindblad master equation, which provides a consistent framework for incorporating environmental effects into the evolution of the system. Since exact solutions are rarely available, numerical methods become essential tools for analyzing such systems. This article presents a step-by-step implementation of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method in Python to solve the Lindblad equation for a single quantized field mode subject to decay. A coherent state is used as the initial condition, and the time evolution of the average photon number is investigated. The proposed methodology enables transparent and customizable simulations of dissipative quantum dynamics, emphasizing a pedagogical approach that helps readers understand the numerical structure without relying on external libraries such as QuTiP. This standalone implementation offers full control over each integration step, making it particularly suitable for educational contexts and for exploring non-standard dynamics or introducing custom modifications to the Liouvillian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a random light field can be used for high-precision metrology purposes, given the introduction of specific boundary conditions in the form of Lambertian reflections inside a cavity. We demonstrate a quantifiable and reproducible interferometric response to minute perturbations in wavelength, refractive index, and geometry, predicting high sensitivities in good agreement with experimental measurements of geometrical deformations down to the picometer.</description>

      <title>Three-Wave Interaction Grating Coupler with Sub-Decibel Insertion Loss at Normal Incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the design, fabrication in a commercial foundry, and experimental results of high-efficiency, normal incidence grating couplers for silicon photonics. We observe a maximum coupling efficiency of 85.4% (-0.69 dB) with a 1 dB bandwidth of 20 nm at a central wavelength of 1546 nm. These experimental results verify earlier theoretical and simulation results and pave the way for the use of perfectly vertical grating couplers, as an alternative to edge coupling, in silicon photonics applications that are sensitive to input coupling loss. Further, these results enable the use of grating couplers for vertically oriented elements, such as multicore fibers and VCSELs, and address challenges associated with coupling to free space beams.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of quasi-localized phonons-mediated non-Markovianity dynamics of SiV^- centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we investigate the temperature-dependent non-Markovian dynamics of the SiV^- center in diamond, focusing on the roles of low- and high-frequency quasi-localized phonon modes. Low-frequency phonons exhibit stronger electron-phonon coupling, leading to long-lived dephasing rate, while high-frequency phonons induce rapid attenuation of oscillatory dephasing rate facilitating a persistent memory effect. The non-Markovianity measure N_C shows memory effects persisting at low temperatures but diminishing at high temperatures due to enhanced damping. The temperature dependence of N_C follows a monotonic decay, from which a transition temperature T_NM=110 K is determined. These results highlight the interplay between phonon activation and damping in shaping quantum coherence, offering insights for optimizing solid-state quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear reversal of photo-excitation on the attosecond time scale improves ultrafast x-ray diffraction images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of isolated and intense sub-femtosecond X-ray pulses enables tracking of quantummechanical motion of electrons in molecules and solids. The combination of X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction imaging is a powerful approach to visualize non-equilibrium dynamics in systems beyond few atoms. However, extreme x-ray intensities introduce significant electronic damage, limiting material contrast and spatial resolution. Here we show that newly available intense subfemtosecond (sub-fs) x-ray FEL pulses can outrun most ionization cascades and partially reverse x-ray damage through stimulated x-ray emission in the vicinity of a resonance. In our experiment, we compared thousands of coherent x-ray diffraction patterns and simultaneously recorded ion spectra from individual Ne nanoparticles injected into the FEL focus. Our experimental results and theoretical modeling reveal that x-ray diffraction increases and the average charge state decreases in particles exposed to sub-fs pulses compared to those illuminated with 15-femtosecond pulses. Sub-fs exposures outrun most Auger decays and impact ionization processes, and enhance nonlinear effects such as stimulated emission, which cycle bound electrons between different states. These findings demonstrate that intense sub-fs x-ray FEL pulses are transformative for advancing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy in chemical and material sciences, and open the possibilities of coherent control of the interaction between x-rays and complex specimen beyond few atoms.</description>

      <title>A broadband platform to search for hidden photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical behavior of a structure consisting of graphene sheets embedded in media was studied, and the differences between the structure and ordinary birefringent crystal, double zero-reflectance point, were identified. We showed the changes in the optical behavior of the structure due to the existence of hidden photons. When a radiation illuminates the structure, only $\omega^2/\omega_p^2&gt;1+\frac{m_X^2 c^4 \chi^2}{\epsilon_r\hbar^2\omega_p^2}$ can propagate through the structure. This provides a broadband platform for detecting hidden photons, where the sensitivity increases with the mass of the hidden photon.In contrast, if the mass of hidden photon is small, one can use a method similar to the light-shining-through-thin-wall technique. The structure is a platform to actively search for hidden photons since the operating point of the structure does not have to match the mass shell of hidden photons.</description>

      <title>Scattering and Chirping at Accelerated Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time varying media with moving interfaces unlock new ways to manipulate electromagnetic waves. Yet, analytical solutions have been mostly limited to interfaces moving at constant velocity or constant proper acceleration. Here, we present exact scattering solutions for an arbitrarily accelerating interface, derived directly in the laboratory frame through a suitable change of variables. We show that acceleration introduces rich effects that do not occur with uniform motion, including transitions between multiple velocity regimes, multiple scattering events and generalized frequency chirping. We also solve the inverse problem of designing an interface trajectory that produces a desired chirping profile, demonstrating how tailored acceleration can synthesize complex frequency modulations. These results provide a fundamental framework to understand and control wave interactions with accelerated boundaries, opening pathways for advanced applications in space-time signal processing and dynamic pulse shaping.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Induced Oxidation for Enhanced Purity and Reproducibility of Quantum Emission in Monolayer 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a voltage-induced oxidation technique using conductive atomic force microscopy to enhance the single-photon purity and reproducibility of quantum emitters in monolayer tung-sten diselenide (WSe2). By applying a controlled electric field across a monolayer WSe2/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) on a silicon substrate, localized oxidation is induced around nanoindented emitter sites in the WSe2. This treatment selectively suppresses defect-bound exciton emissions while preserving emission from pristine regions within the indentations. Photoluminescence and second-order correlation measurements at 18 K demonstrate a substantial increase in single-photon purity when comparing emitters from untreated and voltage-treated regions. Emitters from untreated regions showed average values of g2(0) near or above the 0.5 threshold. In contrast, emitters from voltage-treated regions exhibited g2(0) values consistently below 0.14, with most falling near 0.05, demonstrating high-purity single-photon emission well below the g2(0) &lt; 0.5 threshold. This enhancement results from the oxidation-induced suppression of spurious luminescence from the area around the quantum emitter site that is spectrally degenerate with the single-photon wavelength. This approach offers nonvolatile, spatially selective control over the emitter environment without degrading the emission intensity, improving both purity and stability. It provides a scalable route for integrating high-quality quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials into photonic platforms. Integration with spectral tuning strategies such as strain engineering, local dielectric patterning, or electrostatic gating could further enable deterministic, wavelength-selective single-photon sources for advanced quantum photonic applications</description>

      <title>Programmable photonic quantum walks on lattices with cyclic, toroidal, and cylindrical topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic implementations of unitary processes on lattice structures, such as quantum walks, have been demonstrated across various architectures. However, few platforms offer the combined advantages of scalability, reconfigurability, and the ability to simulate dynamics on lattices with periodic boundary conditions, such as cyclic or toroidal geometries. Here, we employ a recently developed platform that enables the implementation of arbitrary translationally invariant unitary operations on one- and two-dimensional lattices, and demonstrate a natural mechanism for introducing periodic boundary conditions. Our approach leverages direct access to the reciprocal lattice, where discrete sampling of the unitary evolution effectively enforces the desired topology. We program our platform to realize quantum walks on 1D cyclic lattices and 2D lattices with cylindrical or toroidal topologies. The lattice size can be readily tuned by adjusting the sampling density in reciprocal space. By controlling reciprocal-space occupancy, we investigate the dynamics of localized states and wavepackets, observing refocusing behavior, breathing modes modulated by reciprocal-space discretizations, and wavepacket trajectories that reflect the underlying topology. We further demonstrate a form of dimensional reduction by mapping a 2D quantum walk on a cylinder to a 1D walk with a high-dimensional coin. These results establish a versatile platform for realizing a broad class of optical mode transformations within bounded Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Future prospect of anisotropic 2D tin sulfide (SnS) for emerging electronic and quantum device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Imaging valence electron rearrangement in a chemical reaction using hard X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have observed the signatures of valence electron rearrangement in photoexcited ammonia using ultrafast hard X-ray scattering. Time-resolved X-ray scattering is a powerful tool for imaging structural dynamics in molecules because of the strong scattering from the core electrons localized near each nucleus. Such core-electron contributions generally dominate the differential scattering signal, masking any signatures of rearrangement in the chemically important valence electrons. Ammonia represents an exception to the typically high core-to-valence electron ratio. We measured 9.8 keV X-ray scattering from gas-phase deuterated ammonia following photoexcitation via a 200 nm pump pulse to the 3s Rydberg state. We observed changes in the recorded scattering patterns due to the initial photoexcitation and subsequent deuterium dissociation. Ab initio calculations confirm that the observed signal is sensitive to the rearrangement of the single photoexcited valence electron as well as the interplay between adiabatic and nonadiabatic dissociation channels. The use of ultrafast hard X-ray scattering to image the structural rearrangement of single valence electrons constitutes an important advance in tracking valence electronic structure in photoexcited atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Scalable entangling gates on ion qubits via structured light addressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in developing practical quantum processors is maintaining low control complexity while scaling to large numbers of qubits. Trapped-ion systems excel in small-scale operations and support rapid qubit scaling via long-chain architectures. However, their performance in larger systems is hindered by spectral crowding in radial motional modes, a problem that forces reliance on intricate pulse-shaping techniques to maintain gate fidelities. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a novel trapped-ion processor with an individual-addressing system that generates steerable Hermite-Gaussian beam arrays. The transverse gradient of these beams couples qubits selectively to sparse axial motional modes, enabling to isolate a single mode as entanglement mediator. Leveraging this capability, we demonstrate addressable two-qubit entangling gates in chains up to six ions with fidelities consistently around 0.97, achieved without complex pulse shaping. Our method significantly reduces control overhead while preserving scalability, providing a crucial advance toward practical large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of luminescence chirality through achiral metasurfaces</title>

Abstract: Circularly polarized light (CPL) sources are essential for chiroptics, spintronics, quantum optics, and asymmetric photochemistry. However, conventional approaches fail to simultaneously realize a large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and wide-range tuning of glum in a compact device. Chiral luminophores usually suffer from low glum due to their small molecular sizes. Although chiral metasurfaces can enable a large glum, they lack post-fabrication tunability. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve high-purity circularly polarized luminescence using achiral metasurfaces. These metasurfaces enable optical tuning and even reversal of luminescence chirality by uncovering and utilizing giant near-field chirality. We validate our concept with upconversion nanoparticles and downshifting dye molecules, experimentally achieving a large glum of up to 1.65, which can be actively and continuously tuned between 1.65 and -1.58. Our approach promises important applications in next-generation CPL sources and detectors, and tunable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Chiral Nonlinear Polaritonics with van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the strong-coupling regime, the interaction between light and matter reaches a hybridization state where the photonic and material components are inseparably linked. Using tailored states of light to break symmetries in such systems can facilitate the development of novel non-equilibrium quantum materials. Chiral optical cavities offer a promising approach for this, enabling either temporal or spatial symmetry-breaking, both of which are unachievable with conventional mirror cavities. For spatial symmetry-breaking, a cavity must discriminate the handedness of circularly polarized light, a functionality uniquely provided by chiral metamaterials. Here, we propose and demonstrate experimentally a chiral transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) metasurface with broken out-of-plane symmetry, allowing for the selective formation of self-hybridized exciton-polaritons with specific handedness. Our metasurface maintains maximal chirality for oblique incidence up to 20{\deg}, significantly outperforming all previously known designs, thereby transforming the angle of incidence from a constraint into a new degree of freedom for sub-nanometer-precise tuning of the cavity's resonant wavelength. Moreover, we study the chiral strong-coupling regime in nonlinear experiments and reveal the polariton-driven nature of chiral third-harmonic generation. Our results demonstrate a clear pathway towards van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces as a novel and potent platform for chiral polaritonics with implications in a wide range of photonics research, such as non-reciprocal photonic devices and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling between a dielectric nanocavity and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate strong coupling between light in a dielectric nanocavity with deep sub-wavelength confinement and excitons in a monolayer of molybdenum ditelluride. Avoided crossing is demonstrated by both photoluminescence and reflection measurements, from which we extract a light-matter interaction strength of $g_{\mathrm{PL}} =\SI{5.3\pm0.3}{\milli\eV}$ and $g_{\mathrm{R}} =\SI{4.7\pm0.7}{\milli\eV}$, respectively. The associated Rabi splitting is twice as large as the system's losses. These values are in good agreement with values obtained by a novel exciton reaction coordinate formalism, yielding $g_{\mathrm{theory}} = \SI{5.2\pm0.7}{\milli\eV}$. The strong light-matter interaction, combined with low losses and sub-wavelength confinement of light, black demonstrates a new regime of light-matter interactions where strong nonlinearities at the single-photon level are expected.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of microscopy methods to assess fish intestinal microvilli</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary function of intestinal microvilli is to increase the surface area of the intestinal lining to maximize nutrient absorption. This is especially important as fish, like other animals, need to efficiently absorb proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and minerals from their digested food to support their growth and energy needs. Despite its importance to the fish health, the small size and dense footprint of microvilli hinders its investigation and necessitates the need of advanced microscopy methods for its visualization. Characterization of the microvilli using super-resolution microscopy provides insights into their structural organization, spatial distribution, and surface properties. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of different optical, electron and force microscopy methods for analysis of fish microvilli. The super-resolution optical microscopy methods used are 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM), stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), and fluorescence fluctuation based super-resolution microscopy (FF-SRM). We also visualized the intestinal microvilli in fish using diffraction-limited optical microscopy methods including confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, label-free microscopy methods, such as quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) and bright-field imaging, were also employed. To obtain ultra-high resolution, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We demonstrate a systematic comparison of these microscopy techniques in resolving and quantifying microvilli features, ranging from 1-2 um structural morphology to 10-100 nm surface details.</description>

      <title>Integrated angstrom-tunable polarization-resolved solid-state photon sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of high-quality solid-state photon sources is essential to nano optics, quantum photonics, and related fields. A key objective of this research area is to develop tunable photon sources that not only enhance the performance but also offer dynamic functionalities. However, the realization of compact and robust photon sources with precise and wide range tunability remains a long-standing challenge. Moreover, the lack of an effective approach to integrate nanoscale photon sources with dynamic systems has hindered tunability beyond mere spectral adjustments, such as simultaneous polarization control. Here we propose a platform based on quantum emitter (QE) embedded metasurfaces (QEMS) integrated with a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-positioned microcavity, enabling on-chip multi-degree control of solid-state photon sources. Taking advantages of MEMS-QEMS, we show that typically broadband room-temperature emission from nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy centres can be narrowed to 3.7 nm and dynamically tuned with angstrom resolution. Furthermore, we design a wavelength-polarization-multiplexed QEMS and demonstrate polarization-resolved control of the MEMS-QEMS emission in a wide wavelength range (650 nm to 700 nm) along with polarization switching at sub-millisecond timescales. We believe that the proposed MEMS-QEMS platform can be adapted for most existing QEs, significantly expanding their room-temperature capabilities and thereby enhancing their potential for advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>RS-Coded Adaptive Dynamic Network for Reliable Long-Term Information Transmission in Disturbed Multimode Fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimode fiber (MMF), due to its large core diameter and high mode capacity, holds potential in high-speed communications. However, inherent modal dispersion causes output speckle distortion, and transmission characteristics are sensitive to environmental disturbances, limiting its reliable application. Conventional transmission matrix (TM) methods face challenges such as complex calibration and environmental sensitivity. Although current deep learning approaches demonstrate reconstruction potential, they struggle to overcome error accumulation caused by fiber mode drift and lack sufficient environmental adaptability. To address this, the present study proposes an adaptive transmission framework named Residual Reed-Solomon Dynamic Network (RRSDN), which integrates Reed-Solomon (RS) error correction coding with deep residual learning forming a closed-loop system that jointly optimizes encoding, transmission, and reconstruction, to tackle the key challenges of mode instability and error accumulation in dynamic scattering channels. Experimentally, high-fidelity real-time transmission of a 16*16 pixel video stream (H.265 compressed) with zero frame loss and 100% symbol accuracy was achieved under conditions of a 100-meter MMF with manually applied disturbances and no temperature control. This work proposes a solution for stable optical transmission in complex channels. Plus, it integrates error correction coding with neural network training, laying the foundation for adaptive optical systems in longer-distance and more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optically tunable linear and nonlinear enhancement of index of refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control of optical properties of materials by tuning their refractive index can revolutionize the current state-of-the-art technology to manipulate light propagation in the high loss media. Here we demonstrate active optical tuning of the plasmonic analog of \textit{enhancement of index of refraction} (EIR) in both linear and nonlinear regimes using a quantum mechanical approach. By employing a pump-probe scheme, we investigate the tuning of refractive index of the probe field by varying amplitude and phase of the pump source. In contrast to classical approach used in \cite{Panahpour2019}, we formulate both first- and second-order quantization to analyze nonlinear enhancement in the refractive index by modulating the response function of probe field. This approach enables indirect tuning of nonlinear modes and coherent control of the probe pulse under the coupling of linear plasmonic modes supported by two L-shaped nano-ellipsoids. Varying the pump amplitude not only shows a significant enhancement in the EIR in both regimes but also effectively suppresses optical losses with zero dispersion at the system's resonance frequency. Additionally, tuning pump phase induces a spectral shift in the frequency of the probe field which open new ways for active tuning of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Our approach offers all-optical tuning of nonlinear refractive index which is essential for quantum technological applications. It also provides coherent control of optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures with applications in loss-compensated propagation and zero-index to high-refractive-index plasmonic metamaterials, as well as photonic switches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a long-cavity semiconductor laser subject to optical feedback is exploited to generate repetitive temporal patterns with enhanced intra-pattern sample diversity. Stable limit cycle dynamics characterized by multiple frequency harmonics are experimentally demonstrated by considering a 2 m external cavity with appropriate optical feedback conditions. This simple configuration can enable stable and continuous generation of periodic waveforms with a tunable repetition rate ranging from 3.28 to 4.21 GHz. Distinct, highly consistent temporal patterns are obtained by applying high-pass filtering to adjust the relative power of the harmonics. The resulting system operates as a physical waveform generator capable of producing diverse and repeatable signal patterns, making it well-suited for use in the masking stage of time delay reservoir computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Lossless, Non-Volatile Post-Fabrication Trimming of PICs via On-Chip High-Temperature Annealing of Undercut Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Limited by equipment precision, manufacturing deviations in waveguide width, etch depth, and layer thickness inevitably occur in photonic integrated circuits (PICs). These variations cause initial phase errors, compromising the reliability of phase-sensitive devices such as Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZI) and microring resonators. To overcome this, we report a nonvolatile, near-lossless post-trimming method utilizing sufficient high-temperature thermal treatment for undercut waveguides, reported here for the first time to the best of our knowledge. This CMOS-compatible approach requires no additional processes or equipment, enables simple electrical heating for trimming, and retains long-term stability after high-temperature removal, ensuring high energy efficiency. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that high-temperature thermal treatment induces irreversible lattice expansion in silicon waveguides, leading to a reduction in the real refractive index and enabling compensation for process errors. Experimental results using MZIs confirm a permanent refractive index reduction of 0.0173 and high-resolution tuning up to 5.25 bits, effective across a broadband spectrum and stable for over 218 days after final trimming. Furthermore, 15 MZIs on a single wafer are precisely calibrated to BAR, CROSS, or orthogonal states, demonstrating the method universality. This practical and scalable technique enables reliable post-fabrication trimming for next-generation low-cost, energy-efficient PIC applications such as optical switches and optical computing.</description>
