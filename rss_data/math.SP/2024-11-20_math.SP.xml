      <title>Magnetic tunneling between disc-shaped obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive formulae for the semiclassical tunneling in the presence of a constant magnetic field in 2 dimensions. The `wells' in the problem are identical discs with Neumann boundary conditions, so we study the magnetic Neumann Laplacian in the complement of a set of discs. We provide a reduction method to an interaction matrix, which works for a general configuration of obstacles. When there are two discs, we deduce an asymptotic formula for the spectral gap. When the discs are placed along a regular lattice, we derive an effective operator which gives rise to the famous Harper's equation. Main challenges in this problem compared to recent results on magnetic tunneling are the fact that one-well ground states have non-trivial angular momentum which depends on the semiclassical parameter, and the existence of eigenvalue crossings.</description>

      <title>A characterization of graphs $G$ with $m_G(\lambda)= 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$</title>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph. If every pendant path in $G$ is at least $P_s$, we denote that $G\in \mathbb{G}_s$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, let $Q_s(G)$ be the set of vertices in $G$ that are distance $s$ from the pendant vertex, and let $|Q_s(G)| = q_s(G)$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, Li et al. (2024) proved that when $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $P_s$ and $G$ is neither a cycle nor a starlike tree $T_k$, it holds that $m_G(\lambda) \leq 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ and characterized the extremal graphs when $G$ is a tree. In this article, we characterize the extremal graphs for which $m_G(\lambda) = 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ when $G \in \mathbb{G}_{s}$ and $\lambda\notin \sigma(P_s)$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability in a free boundary model of active locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction-driven self-propulsion of a large class of living cells can be modeled by a Keller-Segel system with free boundaries. The ensuing "active" system, exhibiting both dissipation and anti-dissipation, features stationary and traveling wave solutions. While the former represent static cells, the latter describe propagating pulses (solitary waves) mimicking the autonomous locomotion of the same cells. In this paper we provide the first proof of the asymptotic nonlinear stability of both of such solutions, static and dynamic. In the case of stationary solutions, the linear stability is established using the spectral theorem for compact, self-adjoint operators, and thus linear stability is determined classically, solely by eigenvalues. For traveling waves the picture is more complex because the linearized problem is non-self-adjoint, opening the possibility of a "dark" area in the phase space which is not "visible" in the purely eigenvalue/eigenvector approach. To establish linear stability in this case we employ spectral methods together with the Gearhart-Pruss-Greiner (GPG) theorem, which controls the entire spectrum via bounds on the resolvent operator. For both stationary and traveling wave solutions, nonlinear stability is then proved by showing how the nonlinear part of the problem may be dominated by the linear part and then employing a Gronwall inequality argument. The developed novel methodology can prove useful also in other problems involving non-self-adjoint (non-Hermitian or non-reciprocal) operators which are ubiquitous in the modeling of "active" matter.</description>
