      <title>GDSW preconditioners for composite Discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of multicompartment reaction-diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present work is to design, analyze theoretically, and test numerically, a generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) preconditioner for composite Discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of multicompartment parabolic reaction-diffusion equations, where the solution can exhibit natural discontinuities across the domain. We prove that the resulting preconditioned operator for the solution of the discrete system arising at each time step converges with a scalable and quasi-optimal upper bound for the condition number. The GDSW preconditioner is then applied to the EMI (Extracellular - Membrane - Intracellular) reaction-diffusion system, recently proposed to model microscopically the spatiotemporal evolution of cardiac bioelectrical potentials. Numerical tests validate the scalability and quasi-optimality of the EMI-GDSW preconditioner, and investigate its robustness with respect to the time step size as well as jumps in the diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Monotone two-scale methods for a class of integrodifferential operators and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a monotone, two-scale discretization for a class of integrodifferential operators of order $2s$, $s \in (0,1)$. We apply it to develop numerical schemes, and convergence rates, for linear and obstacle problems governed by such operators. As applications of the monotonicity, we provide error estimates for free boundaries and a convergent numerical scheme for a concave fully nonlinear, nonlocal, problem.</description>

      <title>State Feedback as a Strategy for Control and Analysis of COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study on a compartmental epidemic model for COVID-19, examining the stability of its equilibrium points upon the introduction of vaccination as a strategy to mitigate the spread of the disease. Initially, the SIQR (Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantine-Recovered) mathematical model and its technical aspects are introduced. Subsequently, vaccination is incorporated as a control measure within the model scope. Equilibrium points and the basic reproductive number are determined, followed by an analysis of their stability. Furthermore, controllability characteristics and Optimal Control strategies for the system are investigated, supplemented by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spatially homogeneous granular medium equation \[\partial_t\mu=\rm{div}(\mu\nabla V)+\rm{div}(\mu(\nabla W \ast \mu))+\Delta\mu\,,\] within a large and natural class of the confinement potentials $V$ and interaction potentials $W$. The considered problem do not need to assume that $\nabla V$ or $\nabla W$ are globally Lipschitz. With the aim of providing particle approximation of solutions, we design efficient forward-backward splitting algorithms. Sharp convergence rates in terms of the Wasserstein distance are provided.</description>

      <title>Full Field Inversion of the Attenuated Wave Equation: Theory and Numerical Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard photoacoustic tomography (PAT) provides data that consist of time-dependent signals governed by the wave equation, which are measured on an observation surface. In contrast, the measured data from the recently invented full-field PAT is the Radon transform of the solution of the wave equation on a spatial domain at a single instant in time. While reconstruction using classical PAT data has been extensively studied, not much is known about the full-field PAT problem. In this paper, we study full-field photoacoustic tomography with spatially variable sound speed and spatially variable damping. In particular, we prove the uniqueness and stability of the associated single-time full-field wave inversion problem and develop algorithms for its numerical inversion using iterative and variational regularization methods. Numerical simulations are presented for both full-angle and limited-angle data cases</description>

      <title>A space-time variational formulation for the many-body electronic Schr{\"o}dinger evolution equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove in this paper that the solution of the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation can be expressed as the solution of a global space-time quadratic minimization problem that is amenable to Galerkin time-space discretization schemes, using an appropriate least-square formulation. The present analysis can be applied to the electronic many-body time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation with an arbitrary number of electrons and interaction potentials with Coulomb singularities. We motivate the interest of the present approach with two goals: first, the design of Galerkin space-time discretization methods; second, the definition of dynamical low-rank approximations following a variational principle different from the classical Dirac-Frenkel principle, and for which it is possible to prove the global-in-time existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>A comparison of mixed precision iterative refinement approaches for least-squares problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various approaches to iterative refinement (IR) for least-squares problems have been proposed in the literature and it may not be clear which approach is suitable for a given problem. We consider three approaches to IR for least-squares problems when two precisions are used and review their theoretical guarantees, known shortcomings and when the method can be expected to recognize that the correct solution has been found, and extend uniform precision analysis for an IR approach based on the semi-normal equations to the two-precision case. We focus on the situation where it is desired to refine the solution to the working precision level. It is shown that the IR methods exhibit different sensitivities to the conditioning of the problem and the size of the least-squares residual, which should be taken into account when choosing the IR approach. We also discuss a new approach that is based on solving multiple least-squares problems.</description>

      <title>Going Beyond the MHD Approximation: Physics-Based Numerical Solution of the CGL Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new numerical model for solving the Chew-Goldberger-Low system of equations describing a bi-Maxwellian plasma in a magnetic field. Heliospheric and geospace environments are often observed to be in an anisotropic state with distinctly different parallel and perpendicular pressure components. The CGL system represents the simplest leading order correction to the common isotropic MHD model that still allows to incorporate the latter's most desirable features. However, the CGL system presents several numerical challenges: the system is not in conservation form, the source terms are stiff, and unlike MHD it is prone to a loss of hyperbolicity if the parallel and perpendicular pressures become too different. The usual cure is to bring the parallel and perpendicular pressures closer to one another; but that has usually been done in an ad hoc manner. We present a physics-informed method of pressure relaxation based on the idea of pitch-angle scattering that keeps the numerical system hyperbolic and naturally leads to zero anisotropy in the limit of very large plasma beta. Numerical codes based on the CGL equations can, therefore, be made to function robustly for any magnetic field strength, including the limit where the magnetic field approaches zero. The capabilities of our new algorithm are demonstrated using several stringent test problems that provide a comparison of the CGL equations in the weakly and strongly collisional limits. This includes a test problem that mimics interaction of a shock with a magnetospheric environment in 2D.</description>

      <title>Unisolver: PDE-Conditional Transformers Are Universal PDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve the PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a specific set of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation or a finite set of coefficients. This bottleneck limits the generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major advantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a Transformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable generalizability and scalability.</description>

      <title>Tamed Langevin sampling under weaker conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to deep learning which often fail standard Lipschitz smoothness requirements, we examine the problem of sampling from distributions that are not log-concave and are only weakly dissipative, with log-gradients allowed to grow superlinearly at infinity. In terms of structure, we only assume that the target distribution satisfies either a log-Sobolev or a Poincar\'e inequality and a local Lipschitz smoothness assumption with modulus growing possibly polynomially at infinity. This set of assumptions greatly exceeds the operational limits of the "vanilla" unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), making sampling from such distributions a highly involved affair. To account for this, we introduce a taming scheme which is tailored to the growth and decay properties of the target distribution, and we provide explicit non-asymptotic guarantees for the proposed sampler in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, total variation, and Wasserstein distance to the target distribution.</description>

      <title>A Regularization for Time-Fractional Backward Heat Conduction Problem with Inhomogeneous Source Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Nair and Danumjaya (2023) introduced a new regularization method for the homogeneous time-fractional backward heat conduction problem (TFBHCP) in a one-dimensional space variable, for determining the initial value function. In this paper, the authors extend the analysis done in the above referred paper to a more general setting of an inhomogeneous time-fractional heat equation involving the higher dimensional state variables and a general elliptic operator. We carry out the analysis for the newly introduced regularization method for the TFBHCP providing optimal order error estimates under a source condition by choosing the regularization parameter appropriately, and also carry out numerical experiments illustrating the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large amount of multidimensional data represented by multiway arrays or tensors are prevalent in modern applications across various fields such as chemometrics, genomics, physics, psychology, and signal processing. The structural complexity of such data provides vast new opportunities for modeling and analysis, but efficiently extracting information content from them, both statistically and computationally, presents unique and fundamental challenges. Addressing these challenges requires an interdisciplinary approach that brings together tools and insights from statistics, optimization and numerical linear algebra among other fields. Despite these hurdles, significant progress has been made in the last decade. This review seeks to examine some of the key advancements and identify common threads among them, under eight different statistical settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops efficient preconditioned iterative solvers for incompressible flow problems discretised by an enriched Taylor-Hood mixed approximation, in which the usual pressure space is augmented by a piecewise constant pressure to ensure local mass conservation. This enrichment process causes over-specification of the pressure when the pressure space is defined by the union of standard Taylor-Hood basis functions and piecewise constant pressure basis functions, which complicates the design and implementation of efficient solvers for the resulting linear systems. We first describe the impact of this choice of pressure space specification on the matrices involved. Next, we show how to recover effective solvers for Stokes problems, with preconditioners based on the singular pressure mass matrix, and for Oseen systems arising from linearised Navier-Stokes equations, by using a two-stage pressure convection-diffusion strategy. The codes used to generate the numerical results are available online.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear spectral core-periphery detection method for multiplex networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-periphery detection aims to separate the nodes of a complex network into two subsets: a core that is densely connected to the entire network and a periphery that is densely connected to the core but sparsely connected internally. The definition of core-periphery structure in multiplex networks that record different types of interactions between the same set of nodes on different layers is nontrivial since a node may belong to the core in some layers and to the periphery in others. We propose a nonlinear spectral method for multiplex networks that simultaneously optimises a node and a layer coreness vector by maximising a suitable nonconvex homogeneous objective function by a provably convergent alternating fixed point iteration. We derive a quantitative measure for the quality of a given multiplex core-periphery structure that allows the determination of the optimal core size. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world networks illustrate that our approach is robust against noisy layers and significantly outperforms baseline methods while improving the latter with our novel optimised layer coreness weights. As the runtime of our method depends linearly on the number of edges of the network it is scalable to large-scale multiplex networks.</description>

Abstract: Elliptic reconstruction property, originally introduced by Makridakis and Nochetto for linear parabolic problems, is a well-known tool to derive optimal a posteriori error estimates. No such results are known for nonlinear and nonsmooth problems such as parabolic variational inequalities (VIs). This article establishes the elliptic reconstruction property for parabolic VIs and derives a posteriori error estimates in $L^{\infty}(0,T;L^{2}(\Omega))$. The estimator consists of discrete complementarity terms and standard residual. As an application, the residual-type error estimates are presented.</description>

      <title>Towards a Low-SWaP 1024-beam Digital Array: A 32-beam Sub-system at 5.8 GHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wave communications require multibeam beamforming in order to utilize wireless channels that suffer from obstructions, path loss, and multi-path effects. Digital multibeam beamforming has maximum degrees of freedom compared to analog phased arrays. However, circuit complexity and power consumption are important constraints for digital multibeam systems. A low-complexity digital computing architecture is proposed for a multiplication-free 32-point linear transform that approximates multiple simultaneous RF beams similar to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Arithmetic complexity due to multiplication is reduced from the FFT complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\: \log N)$ for DFT realizations, down to zero, thus yielding a 46% and 55% reduction in chip area and dynamic power consumption, respectively, for the $N=32$ case considered. The paper describes the proposed 32-point DFT approximation targeting a 1024-beams using a 2D array, and shows the multiplierless approximation and its mapping to a 32-beam sub-system consisting of 5.8 GHz antennas that can be used for generating 1024 digital beams without multiplications. Real-time beam computation is achieved using a Xilinx FPGA at 120 MHz bandwidth per beam. Theoretical beam performance is compared with measured RF patterns from both a fixed-point FFT as well as the proposed multiplier-free algorithm and are in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Velocity of viscous fingers in miscible displacement: Intermediate concentration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate one-phase flow in porous medium corresponding to a miscible displacement process in which the viscosity of the injected fluid is smaller than the viscosity in the reservoir fluid, which frequently leads to the formation of a mixing zone characterized by thin fingers. The mixing zone grows in time due to the difference in speed between its leading and trailing edges. The transverse flow equilibrium (TFE) model provides estimates of these speeds. We propose an enhancement for the TFE estimates, and provide its theoretical justification. It is based on the assumption that an intermediate concentration exists near the tip of the finger, which allows to reduce the integration interval in the speed estimate. Numerical simulations were conducted that corroborate the new estimates within the computational fluid dynamics model. The refined estimates offer greater accuracy than those provided by the original TFE model.</description>
