      <title>Posterior-Separable Costs and Menu Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an agent with a rationally inattentive preference over menus of acts, as in de Oliveira et al (2017). We show that two axioms, Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives and Ignorance Equivalence, are necessary and sufficient for this agent to have a posterior-separable cost satisfying a mild smoothness condition, called joint-directional differentiability. Viewing the decision-maker's problem as a Bayesian persuasion problem, we also show that these axioms are necessary and sufficient for solvability by a unique hyperplane. When the cost function remains invariant for different priors, we show that these axioms imply uniformly posterior separable costs that are differentiable.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Proportionality in Approval-Based Multiwinner Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive theoretical research on proportionality in approval-based multiwinner voting, its impact on which committees and candidates can be selected in practice remains poorly understood. We address this gap by (i) analyzing the computational complexity of several natural problems related to the behavior of proportionality axioms, and (ii) conducting an extensive experimental study on both real-world and synthetic elections. Our findings reveal substantial variation in the restrictiveness of proportionality across instances, including previously unobserved high levels of restrictiveness in some real-world cases. We also introduce and evaluate new measures for quantifying a candidate's importance for achieving proportional outcomes, which differ clearly from assessing candidate strength by approval score.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Oracles: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15955v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze incomplete-information games where an oracle publicly shares information with players. One oracle dominates another if, in every game, it can match the set of equilibrium outcomes induced by the latter. Distinct characterizations are provided for deterministic and stochastic signaling functions, based on simultaneous posterior matching, partition refinements, and common knowledge components. This study extends the work of Blackwell (1951) to games, and expands the study of Aumann (1976) on common knowledge, along with the companion Part II, which develops a theory of information loops.</description>

      <title>Reputational Conservatism in Expert Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04036v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study expert advice with career concerns and continuous private signals. The principal always implements the safe option, and implements the risky option with a probability increasing in the expert's reputation; outcomes, when realized, update reputation. We show a unique cutoff equilibrium and continuity. Under a relative-diagnosticity condition, the experimentation threshold is increasing in reputation ("playing it safe at the top"). Comparative statics are clean, and success-contingent bonuses map one-to-one into experimentation while gatekeeping scales implemented experimentation and learning.</description>

      <title>Constrained Mediation: Bayesian Implementability of Joint Posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine information structures in settings with privately informed agents and an informationally constrained mediator who supplies additional public signals. Our focus is on characterizing the set of posteriors that the mediator can induce. To this end, we employ a graph-theoretic framework: states are represented as vertices, information sets correspond to edges, and a likelihood ratio function on edges encodes the posterior beliefs. Within this framework, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions, internal and external consistency, for the rationalization of posteriors. Finally, we identify conditions under which a single mediator can implement multiple posteriors, effectively serving as a generator of Blackwell experiments.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Oracles: Part II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies incomplete-information games in which an information provider, an oracle, publicly discloses information to the players. One oracle is said to dominate another if, in every game, it can replicate the equilibrium outcomes induced by the latter. The companion Part I characterizes dominance under deterministic signaling and under stochastic signaling with a unique common knowledge component. The present paper extends the analysis to general environments and provides a characterization of equivalence (mutual dominance) among oracles. To this end, we develop a theory of information loops, thereby extending the seminal work of Blackwell (1951) to strategic environments and Aumann (1976)'s theory of common knowledge.</description>
