      <title>Local boundedness of weak solutions to elliptic equations under unbalanced Orlicz growth conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for the local boundedness of weak solutions to a broad class of nonlinear elliptic equations in divergence form, under unbalanced growth conditions on the stress field. Our analysis is carried out in a non-variational setting, with no symmetry or structural assumptions on the operator. The ellipticity and growth are prescribed via distinct Young functions, leading to a Orlicz-type setting that captures a wide class of nonstandard behaviors. As a special case, the theory encompasses and extends the classical results on equations with $p,q$-growth.</description>

      <title>High Contrast Transmission and Fabry-P\'erot-type Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known, in the acoustic model, that highly contrasting transmission leads to the so-called Minnaert subwavelength resonance. In this work, we show that such highly contrasting transmissions create not only one resonance but a family of infinite resonances located near the real axis where the first one (i.e. the smallest) is indeed the Minnaert one. This family of resonances are the shifts (in the lower complex plan) of the Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian. The well known Minneart resonance is nothing but the shift of the trivial (zero) Neumann eigenvalue of the bubble. These resonances, other than the Minnaert ones, are Fabry-P\'erot-type resonances as the generated total fields, in the bubble, are dominated by a linear combination of the Neumann eigenfunctions which, in particular, might create interferences. In addition, we establish the following properties.
  1. We derive the asymptotic expansions, at the second order, of this family of resonances in terms of the contrasting coefficient.
  2. In the time-harmonic regime, we derive the resolvent estimates of the related Hamiltonian and the asymptotics of scattered fields that are uniform in the whole space, highlighting the contributions from this sequence of resonances.
  3. In the time domain regime, we derive the time behavior of the acoustic microresonator at large time-scales inversely proportional to powers of microresonator's radius.
  4. The analysis shows that near Fabry-P\'erot resonances, the mircoresonator exhibits pronounced anisotropy. We believe that such a feature may pave the way for designing anisotropic metamaterials from simple configurations of a single microresonator.</description>

      <title>Stability and slow dynamics of an interior spiky pattern in a one-dimensional spatial Solow model with capital-induced labor migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most significant findings in the study of spatial Solow-Swan models is the emergence of economic agglomeration, in which economic activities concentrate in specific regions. Such agglomeration provides a fundamental mechanism driving the spatial patterns of urbanization, labor migration, productivity growth, and resource allocation. In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional spatial Solow-Swan model with capital-induced labor migration, which captures the dynamic interaction between labor and capital through migration and accumulation. Focusing on the regime of sufficiently small capital diffusivity, we first construct an interior spike (spiky economic agglomeration) quasi-equilibrium. Next, we perform the linear stability of the corresponding spike equilibrium by using a hybrid asymptotic and numerical method. We show that a single interior spike remains stable for small reaction-time constants but undergoes a Hopf bifurcation when the constant is sufficiently large, leading to oscillations in spike height (economic fluctuation). Finally, we derive a differential-algebraic system to capture the slow drift motion of quasi-equilibrium (core-periphery shift). Numerical simulations are carried out to support our theoretical studies and reveal some intriguing yet unexplained dynamics.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation of singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an approach to study homogenisation of a large class of singular SPDEs of the form $$ \partial_t u_\varepsilon - \nabla\cdot {A}(x/\varepsilon,t/\varepsilon^2) \nabla u_\varepsilon = F(x/\varepsilon , t/\varepsilon^2, u_\varepsilon , \nabla u_\varepsilon , \xi ) $$ which is based on the idea of importing (classical) homogenisation results into the framework of regularity structures and the insight that one can rewrite the SPDE under consideration in terms of a model, where the correctors (from homogenisation theory) are seen as further `abstract noises'.
  As applications, we establish periodic space-time homogenisation results for oscillatory generalisations of the 2d g-PAM and $\Phi^4_3$ equation proving that when the noise is regularised at scale $\delta\ll 1$ solutions to the equation with coefficient field ${A}(x/\varepsilon,t/\varepsilon^2)$, when appropriately renormalised, converge to solutions to the corresponding homogenised equation along any sequence $(\varepsilon,\delta)\to 0$. We make the observation that the unbounded divergences can be written as sums of two types of terms: `small scale' terms, the spatial dependence of which is an explicit local function of the coefficient field and `large scale' terms, which for logarithmic divergences are explicit involving the homogenised matrix and correctors. Furthermore, in order to recover the same solution to the corresponding homogenised equation along any joint limit $(\varepsilon, \delta)\to 0$ one has to subtract additional bounded renormalisation constants which appear due to oscillations at mesoscopic scales, as well as due to resonances between the coefficient field and the oscillations in the nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Joint filtration of compressible immiscible liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider initial boundary value problems arising in mathematical models for joint motion of two immiscible viscous liquids in a pore space of the solid skeleton. First, we consider this physical process at the microscopic level (the pore size $\varepsilon$ is approximately 5-20 microns) governed by the model $\textbf{A}^{\varepsilon}$, consisting of Lame equations for the solid skeleton and the Stokes equations for the liquid components.
  Next, assuming the existence of a weak solution to the corresponding initial boundary value problem at the microscopic level for the model the $\textbf{B}^{\varepsilon}$, that approximate the model $\textbf{A}^{\varepsilon}$, and using the homogenization procedure we derive the Biot's model describing the physical process in consideration at the macroscopic level for two weakly viscous immiscible fluids in the elastic solid skeleton at the macroscopic level.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quasi-periodic waves of cubic nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasi-periodic standing wave solutions of the focusing and defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations in dimension one. In the defocusing case, we establish a diffeomorphic correspondence between the invariants of the ordinary differential equation of the wave profiles and the conserved quantities of the evolution equation. We introduce a numerical scheme to compute the minimizers of the energy at fixed mass and momentum for both focusing and defocusing cases. The scheme is based on a gradient flow approach with discrete renormalization at each time step. The novelty of our scheme is that the renormalization step deals at the same time with the mass and the momentum constraints. In numerical experiments, we observe that a given solution of the profile ordinary differential equation is also a minimizer of the energy at corresponding mass and momentum.</description>

      <title>Existence of multi-solitons with any parameters for the 5D energy critical wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the focusing, energy critical wave equation in dimension 5, we construct multi-solitons with any number of solitons, any choice of signs, speeds, scaling parameters and translation parameters. This requires to revisit in depth previous constructions of multi-solitons based on a unidirectional approach, to fully take into account the dimension of the space and the possibility for solitons to move in any direction.
  Then, as a consequence of this more general construction and of the arguments developed in a previous article, the inelastic nature of any collision of solitons is proved under a non-cancellation assumption on the parameters.</description>

      <title>Classical Euler flows generate the strong Guderley imploding shock wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Guderley's self-similar imploding shock solution for the compressible Euler equations with ideal--gas law ($\gamma&gt;1$) arises from classical, radially symmetric, shock--free data. For such data prescribed at initial time $\mathrm{T_{in}} &lt; 0$, we prove that the flow remains smooth up to a first singular time $t=\mathrm{T}_* \in (\mathrm{T_{in}}, 0)$, where a preshock forms with a $C^{1/3}$ cusp in the fast acoustic variable. From this preshock a unique, initially weak, regular shock is born, whose strength can be made arbitrarily large on a controlled time interval; the front then deforms onto the Guderley shock and implodes at the origin at the collapse time $t=0$. There exists a matching time $t=\mathrm{T_{fin}} \in (\mathrm{T}_*,0)$ such that on $[\mathrm{T_{fin}},0)$ the solution coincides exactly with the classical Guderley self--similar profile, and at $t=\mathrm{T_{fin}}$ the shock trajectory matches the self--similar front to all orders. As $t \to 0^-$, the Euler solution implodes at the center, and continues for $t&gt;0$ as a reflected blast wave, providing a global-in-time unique Euler solution which evolves from regular initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Resonance-induced nonlinear bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonlinear bound states -- time-harmonic and spatially decaying ($L^2$) solutions -- of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger / Gross--Pitaevskii equations (NLS/GP) with a compactly supported linear potential. Such solutions are known to bifurcate from the $L^2$ bound states of an underlying Schr\"odinger operator $H_V=-\partial_x^2+V$. In this article we prove an extension of this result: for the 1D NLS/GP, nonlinear bound states also arise via bifurcation from the scattering resonance states and transmission resonance states of $H_V$, associated with the poles and zeros, respectively, of the reflection coefficients, $r_\pm(k)$, of $H_V$. The corresponding resonance states are non-decaying and only $L^2_{\rm loc}$. In contrast to nonlinear states arising from $L^2$ bound states of $H_V$, these resonance bifurcations initiate at a strictly positive $L^2$ threshold which is determined by the position of the complex scattering resonance pole or transmission resonance zero.</description>

      <title>Boundary controllability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation: The Neumann case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article gives a necessary first step to understanding the critical set phenomenon for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation posed on interval $[0,L]$ considering the Neumann boundary conditions with only one control input. We showed that the KdV equation is controllable in the critical case, i.e., when the spatial domain $L$ belongs to the set $\mathcal{R}_c$, where $c\neq-1$ and $$
  \mathcal{R}_c:=\left\{\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3(c+1)}}\sqrt{m^2+ml+m^2};\ m,l\in \mathbb{N}^*\right\}\cup\left\{\frac{m\pi}{\sqrt{c+1}};\ m\in \mathbb{N}^*\right\}, $$ the KdV equation is exactly controllable in $L^2(0,L)$. The result is achieved using the return method together with a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>On the number of nodal domains of homogeneous caloric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the minimum and maximum number of nodal domains across all time-dependent homogeneous caloric polynomials of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}$ (space $\times$ time), i.e., polynomial solutions of the heat equation satisfying $\partial_t p\not\equiv 0$ and $$p(\lambda x, \lambda^2 t) = \lambda^d p(x,t)\quad\text{for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $t \in \mathbb{R}$, and $\lambda &gt; 0$.}$$ When $n=1$, it is classically known that the number of nodal domains is precisely $2\lceil d/2\rceil$. When $n=2$, we prove that the minimum number of nodal domains is 2 if $d\not \equiv 0\pmod 4$ and is 3 if $d\equiv 0\pmod 4$. When $n\geq 3$, we prove that the minimum number of nodal domains is $2$ for all $d$. Finally, we show that the maximum number of nodal domains is $\Theta(d^n)$ as $d\rightarrow\infty$ and lies between $\lfloor \frac{d}{n}\rfloor^n$ and $\binom{n+d}{n}$ for all $n$ and $d$. As an application and motivation for counting nodal domains, we confirm existence of the singular strata in Mourgoglou and Puliatti's two-phase free boundary regularity theorem for caloric measure.</description>

As a corollary, we prove that finite time blowing up solutions of this equation on a bounded convex domain with $u(\cdot,0)\geq 0$ and $u_t(\cdot,0)\geq 0$ converges to a positive constant after rescaling at the blow-up point for all $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Second radial eigenfunctions to a fractional Dirichlet problem and uniqueness for a semilinear equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the shape of radial second Dirichlet eigenfunctions of fractional Schr\"odinger type operators of the form $(-\Delta)^s +V$ in the unit ball $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with a nondecreasing radial potential $V$. Specifically, we show that the eigenspace corresponding to the second radial eigenvalue is simple and spanned by an eigenfunction $u$ which changes sign precisely once in the radial variable and does not have zeroes anywhere else in $B$. Moreover, by a new Hopf type lemma for supersolutions to a class of degenerate mixed boundary value problems, we show that $u$ has a nonvanishing fractional boundary derivative on $\partial B$. We apply this result to prove uniqueness and nondegeneracy of positive ground state solutions to the problem $(-\Delta)^s u+\lambda u=u^p$ on ${B}$, $\; u=0$ on $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus B$. Here $s\in (0,1)$, $\lambda\geq 0$ and $p&gt;1$ is strictly smaller than the critical Sobolev exponent.</description>

Abstract: This article focuses on the study of the existence, multiplicity and concentration behavior of ground states as well as the qualitative aspects of positive solutions for a $(p, N)$-Laplace Schr\"{o}dinger equation with logarithmic nonlinearity and critical exponential nonlinearity in the sense of Trudinger-Moser in the whole Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^N$. Through the use of smooth variational methods, penalization techniques, and the application of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category theory, we establish a connection between the number of positive solutions and the topological properties of the set in which the potential function achieves its minimum values.</description>

Abstract: We study the energy-critical half-wave maps equation: \[ \partial_t \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} \] for $\mathbf{u} : [0, T) \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. Our main result establishes the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all rational initial data $\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. This demonstrates global well-posedness for a dense subset within the scaling-critical energy space $\dot{H}^{1/2}(\mathbb{R}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Furthermore, we prove soliton resolution for a dense subset of initial data in the energy space, with uniform bounds for all higher Sobolev norms $\dot{H}^s$ for $s &gt; 0$.
  Our analysis utilizes the Lax pair structure of the half-wave maps equation on Hardy spaces in combination with an explicit flow formula. Extending these results, we establish global well-posedness for rational initial data (along with a soliton resolution result) for a generalized class of matrix-valued half-wave maps equations with target spaces in the complex Grassmannians $\mathbf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$. Notably, this includes the complex projective spaces $ \mathbb{CP}^{d-1} \cong \mathbf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^d)$ thereby extending the classical case of the target $\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative lower bound for solutions to the Boltzmann equation in non-convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we deal with the continuous mild solutions of the Boltzmann equation in a bounded space domain, either with angular cutoff or non cutoff assumption. Without assuming that the space domain is convex, we construct a Maxwellian lower bound in the cutoff case, and a weaker-than-Maxwellian lower bound in the non-cutoff case, thus extending results of \cite{Bri 1,Bri 2} in which the domain was assumed to be convex.</description>

      <title>Observability of Schr\"odinger propagators on tori in rough settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On tori of arbitrary dimensions, Schr\"odinger propagators with bounded potentials are conjectured to be observable from space-time domains of positive Lebesgue measure. We reduce this conjecture to certain integrability bounds for free Schr\"odinger waves, thereby proving the conjecture on the one-dimensional torus and producing new examples of observation domains. These bounds are far weaker than Bourgain's conjectured periodic Strichartz estimates, yet remain highly nontrivial.</description>

      <title>The local regularity theory for the Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations near the curved boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study local regularity of the solutions to the Stokes equations near a curved boundary under no-slip or Navier boundary conditions. We extend previous boundary estimates near a flat boundary to that near a curved boundary, under very low starting regularity assumptions. Compared with the flat case, the proof for the curved case is more complicated and we adapt new techniques such as the ``normal form" after the mollification, recovering vertical derivative estimates from horizontal derivative estimates, and transferring temporal derivatives to spatial derivatives, to deal with the higher order perturbation terms generated by boundary straightening. As an application, we propose a new definition of boundary regular points for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations that guarantees higher spatial regularity.</description>

      <title>Intermittent Solutions of the Stationary 2D Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct non-trivial solutions to the stationary dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation on the two dimensional torus which lie in $\dot{H}^{-1-\epsilon}(\mathbb{T}^2)$ for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Due to the fact that our solutions do not lie in $\dot{H}^{-1/2}(\mathbb{T}^2)$, we must redefine the notion of solution. The main new ingredient is the incorporation of intermittency into the construction of the solutions, which allows for the exponent in the dissipation term to take any value in the interval $(0,2]$ and also ensures that $\Lambda^{-1}\theta \in L^p(\mathbb{T}^2)$ for all $1 \leq p &lt; 2$.</description>

      <title>On the singularities of the spectral shift function for some tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider perturbed discrete tight-binding models in $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z_h},\mathcal{G})$ describing union of quantum particles with localized interactions, where $\mathbb{Z_h}$ is the 1D lattice $h\mathbb{Z_h}$, $h &gt; 0$, and $\mathcal G$ is a separable Hilbert space. The perturbations play the role of self-adjoint relatively compact (matrix-valued) electric potentials with $\mathcal B(\mathcal G)$-valued coefficients decaying polynomially at infinity. We analyze the Spectral Shift Function (SSF) associated to the pair of the perturbed and the unperturbed operators. On the one hand, we show that the SSF is bounded near the spectral thresholds of the essential spectrum if $\dim(\mathcal G) &lt; +\infty$. On the other hand, if $\dim(\mathcal G) = +\infty$, we show that it may have singularities at some thresholds points $\mu$ of the essential spectrum. In particular, new mechanisms allowing the SSF to have singularities at the thresholds are exhibited, based on the degeneracy of the spectrum of the unperturbed operator. Moreover, we give the main terms of the asymptotic behaviors of the SSF near $\mu$ described in terms of some explicit effective Berezin-Toeplitz type operators. These results are completed by Levinson type formulas and examples of eigenvalues asymptotics for power-like and exponential decay potentials.</description>

      <title>$(INV)$ condition and regularity of the inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f \colon \Omega \to \Omega' $ be a Sobolev mapping of finite distortion between planar domains $\Omega $ and $\Omega'$, satisfying the $(INV)$ condition and coinciding with a homeomorphism near $\partial\Omega $. We show that $f$ admits a generalized inverse mapping $h \colon \Omega' \to \Omega$, which is also a Sobolev mapping of finite distortion and satisfies the $(INV)$ condition.
  We also establish a higher-dimensional analogue of this result: if a mapping $f \colon \Omega \to \Omega' $ of finite distortion is in the Sobolev class $W^{1,p}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^n)$ with $p &gt; n-1$ and satisfies the $(INV)$ condition, then $f$ has an inverse in $W^{1,1}(\Omega', \mathbb{R}^n)$ that is also of finite distortion.
  Furthermore, we characterize Sobolev mappings satisfying $(INV)$ whose generalized inverses have finite $n$-harmonic energy.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness in the Plateau problem for calibrated currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every compactly supported smoothly calibrated integral current with connected $C^{3,\alpha}$ boundary is the unique solution to the oriented Plateau problem for its boundary data. The same holds true for compactly supported $``$continuously calibrated$"$ integral flat chains. This is proved as a consequence of the boundary regularity theory for area-minimizing currents and a unique continuation argument in the spirit of Frank Morgan. In codimension one, the argument yields a sufficient condition for uniqueness in the oriented Plateau problem expressed in terms of the regularity of the calibrating form.</description>
