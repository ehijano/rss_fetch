      <title>Transport of Particles in Strongly Turbulent 3D Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we examine particle transport in strongly turbulent three-dimensional (3D) magnetized plasmas, characterized by intense (large-amplitude) magnetic field fluctuations. Such environments naturally give rise to a network of coherent structures (CoSs), including current sheets, filaments, shocks, switchbacks, and significant magnetic perturbations, which critically influence particle dynamics at the kinetic level. Within this turbulent regime, two fundamental particle energization mechanisms emerge, stochastic acceleration and systematic acceleration. Systematic acceleration within open turbulent volumes promotes the development of power-law tails in energy distributions. Our analysis distinguishes the roles of two electric fields: the perpendicular (or convective) fields, which drive stochastic heating via interactions with randomly moving scatterers, and the parallel electric fields, which enable systematic particle acceleration in regions of strong currents. Combined with accurate estimates of particle escape times in finite volumes, the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the formation of Kappa distributions. The transport properties differ significantly between the two energization modes. Stochastic energization follows Gaussian statistics and can be effectively described by the Fokker-Planck equation. In contrast, systematic acceleration exhibits Levy flight statistics, necessitating a fractional transport equation for an accurate description. Furthermore, the fractal spatial distribution of CoSs introduces deviations from traditional transport models, influencing e.g. particle escape times. Systematic acceleration is most efficient during the early, high-energy phases of turbulence, while stochastic heating becomes dominant during the later stages, contributing to gradual particle energization.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of 2D line-integrated electron density using angular filter refractometry and a fast marching Eikonal solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refraction of an optical probe beam by a plasma can be measured with angular filter refractometry (AFR), which produces an image containing intensity contours that correspond to curves of constant refraction angle. Further analysis is required to reconstruct the underlying line-integrated electron density. Most prior efforts to calculate density from AFR data have been limited to 1D analysis or forward-fitting techniques. In this paper, we detail the use of a fast marching Eikonal solver to directly invert AFR data and obtain the 2D line-integrated electron density. The analysis method is first verified with synthetic data and then applied to laser-driven experiments of single and double plume expansion collected at the OMEGA EP Laser Facility. The calculated densities agree with 1D results and are shown to be consistent with the original AFR measurements via forward modeling. We also discuss how additional measurements could improve the precision of this technique.</description>

      <title>Energetics and limitations of passive electron transpiration cooling for hypersonic leading edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron transpiration cooling (ETC) offers a promising approach for thermal management of hypersonic vehicles by leveraging thermionic emission from the leading edge. While emitted electrons cool the surface, subsequent collection of flowfield electrons induces heating, limiting ETC effectiveness unless collection occurs in cooler aftbody regions. Most existing ETC studies neglect this heating contribution, assuming ideal downstream collection. This work integrates a one-dimensional collisionless plasma sheath model into a discretized leading-edge framework to predict surface potentials and charged-particle fluxes. A parametric study examines how plasma and vehicle properties affect ETC performance. Results reveal that passive ETC is susceptible to thermionic space-charge overcompensation, which can reverse the intended cooling effect and cause surface heating at high plasma densities. Flowfield electron heating can be mitigated but not eliminated by using dielectric coatings or blunt geometries. The same mechanisms that protect blunt bodies from adverse electrical conduction and flowfield heating also preclude incorporation of ETC-based cooling in those vehicle geometries.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Photon Generation from Self-Organized Plasma Cavities in Field-Enhanced Laser-Preplasma Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of an ultraintense Nd:glass laser pulse with a near-critical plasma self-organizes into a highly efficient $\gamma$-ray source. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that relativistic self-focusing, aided by a self-generated electron cavity, enhances the laser intensity by more than an order of magnitude, driving the system into the radiation-reaction-dominated regime, i.e. one where the electrons lose a substantial amount of their energy as hard radiation. Peak photon emission occurs near $0.5$ times the relativistic critical density, with a $\gamma$-photon yield exceeding $20\%$ of the laser energy. Compared to Ti:Sa lasers of the same power, the longer duration of Nd:glass laser pulses leads to an order of magnitude increase in $\gamma$-photon number in the extreme conversion efficiency regime, making them particularly well-suited for photonuclear physics applications. These findings point to a robust and scalable mechanism for compact, ultra-bright $\gamma$-ray generation in the multi-petawatt regime.</description>

      <title>Multiscale turbulence in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first gyrokinetic simulations of multiscale turbulence in a stellarator, using the magnetic geometry of Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and experimentally relevant parameters. A broad range of scenarios is explored, including regimes where electron-temperature-gradient (ETG) turbulence coexists with varying levels of ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) turbulence, as well as cases involving microtearing modes (MTMs) relevant to high-$\beta$ and reactor-like conditions. Notably, while ETG turbulence does not form radial streamers as in tokamaks, it can still drive significant transport and interact with ion-scale turbulence. In electrostatic ITG-dominated regimes, electron-scale fluctuations erode zonal flows, enhancing ion-scale transport, while ion-scale turbulence suppresses ETG activity. In contrast, under electromagnetic MTM conditions, the isotropic nature of ETG turbulence limits its suppressive effect, allowing MTMs to persist. These findings underscore the critical role of cross-scale effects for accurate transport predictions in W7-X and future stellarators.</description>

      <title>Characterization and automated optimization of laser-driven proton beams from converging liquid sheet jet targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact, stable, and versatile laser-driven ion sources hold great promise for applications ranging from medicine to materials science and fundamental physics. While single-shot sources have demonstrated favorable beam properties, including the peak fluxes necessary for several applications, high repetition rate operation will be necessary to generate and sustain the high average flux needed for many of the most exciting applications of laser-driven ion sources. Further, to navigate through the high-dimensional space of laser and target parameters towards experimental optima, it is essential to develop ion acceleration platforms compatible with machine learning learning techniques and capable of autonomous real-time optimization. Here we present a multi-Hz ion acceleration platform employing a liquid sheet jet target. We characterize the laser-plasma interaction and the laser-driven proton beam across a variety of key parameters governing the interaction using an extensive suite of online diagnostics. We also demonstrate real-time, closed-loop optimization of the ion beam maximum energy by tuning the laser wavefront using a Bayesian optimization scheme. This approach increased the maximum proton energy by 11% compared to a manually-optimized wavefront by enhancing the energy concentration within the laser focal spot, demonstrating the potential for closed-loop optimization schemes to tune future ion accelerators for robust high repetition rate operation.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal shaping of broadband helical light pulses at relativistic intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal control of laser pulses at relativistic intensities is a longstanding goal with broad implications in laser-plasma acceleration, high-brightness radiation sources, and extreme-field science. Laser pulses with helical spatiotemporal intensity profiles, often referred to as light springs, carry multiple spectral and orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes, producing a rotating intensity profile capable of coupling directly to helical plasma waves. Until now, light springs have only been realized on low-power systems, limited by optical damage thresholds and large-aperture beamline constraints. Here, we report the first experimental realization of light springs at relativistic intensities, achieving peak intensities above $1.4\times10^{18}$ W/cm$^{2}$. Our approach spectrally splits a high-power laser pulse, imprints distinct helical phases on each component, and coherently recombines them. Hyperspectral imaging, off-axis holography, and spectral phase reconstruction confirm excellent agreement with theory and reveal the potential to drive superluminal rotational velocities. Introducing spectral chirp demonstrates further control of the temporal evolution of the transverse mode structure. This platform opens new regimes of ultra-intense laser-plasma interaction where laser OAM can directly couple to plasma OAM.</description>

      <title>Constraining Active Galactic Nucleus Jets with Spectrum and Core Shift: The Case of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically model stationary and axisymmetric active galactic nucleus jets, assuming energy conservation along each magnetic flux tube. Using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and published general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the evolution of the bulk Lorentz factor, the magnetization parameter, and the magnetic field strength along the jet. We then infer the electron density, emission coefficient, and absorption coefficient at each point, and integrate the radiative transfer equation to compute the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the core shift of the synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet. Applying the method to the M87 jet, we find that the hot plasmas are injected at the altitude of seven Schwarzschild radii from the black hole (BH), that the M87 jet is likely composed of a pair plasma, and that the jet flowline geometry is quasi-parabolic as reported at much greater distances. Fitting the nonthermal fraction of the leptonic jet as a function of position, we also find that most of the radio photons are emitted within 1000 Schwarzschild radii from the BH. Although hadronic jets do not reproduce all the VLBI observations consistently in our model, we also discuss that their heavy mass allows a stronger magnetic field within the observational constraints, leading to an inverted SED in sub-millimeter wavelengths by the thermal emission from the jet base. It is therefore implied that contemporaneous observations of the M87 jet with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and VLBI could discriminate the jet composition and its collimation within the central 100 Schwarzschild radii.</description>

      <title>A comparison of low-n Mercier unstable Wendelstein stellarators and quasi-interchange modes in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mercier's criterion is typically enforced as a hard operational limit in stellarator design. At the same time, past experimental and numerical studies have shown that this limit may often be surpassed, though the exact mechanism behind this nonlinear stability is not well understood. This work aims to contribute to our current understanding by comparing the nonlinear evolution of Mercier unstable Wendelstein stellarators to that of nonlinearly stable quasi-interchange modes in tokamaks. A high mirror, very low $\iota$, W7-X-like configuration is first simulated. A second case is then considered using experimental reconstructions of intermediate $\beta$ W7-AS discharges, where saturated low-n modes were observed experimentally, with sustained MHD signatures over tens of milliseconds. The possible reasons for the discrepancies between experiment and simulation, and the observation of partial reconnection in contrast to flux pumping are discussed, in view of reproducing and designing for operation of stellarators beyond the Mercier stability limit.</description>

      <title>Linear Landau damping, Schr\"{o}dinger equation, and fluctuation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linearized Vlasov-Poisson system of equations is transformed into a Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which is used to demonstrate that the fluctuation theorem holds for the relative stochastic entropy, defined in terms of the probability density functional of the particle velocity distribution function in the Landau damping process. The difference between the energy perturbation, normalized by the equilibrium temperature, and the entropy perturbation constitutes a time-independent invariant of the system. This invariant takes the quadratic form of the perturbed velocity distribution function and corresponds to the squared amplitude of the state vector that satisfies the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Exact solutions, constructed from a discrete set of Hamiltonian eigenvectors, are employed to formulate and numerically validate the fluctuation theorem for the Landau damping process. The results offer new insights into the formulations of collisionless plasma processes within the framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Two Types of $1/f$ Range in Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $1/f$ noise is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems. Since the advent of space exploration, the $1/f$ range has been consistently observed in \textit{in situ} solar wind measurements throughout the heliosphere, sparking decades of debate regarding its origin. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations near the Alfv\'en surface have revealed a systematic absence of the $1/f$ range in pristine solar wind, providing a unique opportunity to investigate its origin in solar wind turbulence. Despite numerous observations of the $1/f$ range at varying frequencies, no study has systematically examined its properties across different solar wind conditions. Here, we identify two distinct types of $1/f$ ranges in solar wind turbulence: the fast/Alfv\'enic wind type and the slow/mixed wind type. The fast/Alfv\'enic type appears to be an intrinsic feature of Alfv\'enic turbulence, while the slow/mixed type resembles classical flicker noise. For the fast/Alfv\'enic type, we find a near-perfect WKB evolution of the frequency-averaged fluctuation amplitude and an intriguing migration pattern in frequency space. For the slow/mixed type, we examine the solar cycle dependence of the $1/f$ noise using the OMNI-LRO dataset spanning solar cycles 22 to 25. We also analyze the autocorrelation function of the magnetic field vectors and identify a clear relationship between the $1/f$ range and the decline in correlation, as well as unexpected resonance peaks in the autocorrelation function.</description>
