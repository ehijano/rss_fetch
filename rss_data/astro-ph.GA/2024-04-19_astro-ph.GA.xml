      <title>The Host Galaxy of a Dormant, Overmassive Black Hole at $z=6.7$ May Be Restarting Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST is discovering a large population of $z&gt;4$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are overmassive with respect to the stellar content of their hosts. A previous study developed a physical model to interpret this overmassive population as the result of quasar feedback acting on a compact host galaxy. In this Note, we apply this model to JADES GN 1146115, a dormant supermassive black hole at $z=6.7$ whose mass is $\sim40\%$ of the host's mass in stars and accreting at $\sim2\%$ of the Eddington limit. The host has been forming stars at the low rate of $\sim 1 \, \rm M_\odot \,yr^{-1}$ for the past $\sim 100$ Myr. Our model suggests that this galactic system is on the verge of a resurgence of global star formation activity. This transition comes after a period of domination by the effect of its overmassive black hole, whose duration is comparable to typical quasar lifetimes.</description>

      <title>IMBH Progenitors from Stellar Collisions in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very massive stars (VMSs) formed via a sequence of stellar collisions in dense star clusters have been proposed as the progenitors of massive black hole seeds. VMSs could indeed collapse to form intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), which would then grow by accretion to become the supermassive black holes observed at the centers of galaxies and powering high-redshift quasars. Previous studies have investigated how different cluster initial conditions affect the formation of a VMS, including mass segregation, stellar collisions, and binaries, among others. In this study, we investigate the growth of VMSs with a new grid of Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) star cluster simulations -- the most expansive to date. The simulations span a wide range of initial conditions, varying the number of stars, cluster density, stellar initial mass function (IMF), and primordial binary fraction. We find a gradual shift in the mass of the most massive collision product across the parameter space; in particular, denser clusters born with top-heavy IMFs provide strong collisional regimes that form VMSs with masses easily exceeding 1000 solar masses. Our results are used to derive a fitting formula that can predict the typical mass of a VMS formed as a function of the star cluster properties. Additionally, we study the stochasticity of this process and derive a statistical distribution for the mass of the VMS formed in one of our models, recomputing the model 50 times with different initial random seeds.</description>

      <title>The impact of stellar bars on quenching star formation: insights from a spatially resolved analysis in the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar bars are common morphological structures in the local Universe: according to optical and NIR surveys, they are present in about two-thirds of disc galaxies. These elongated structures are also believed to play a crucial role in secular evolutionary processes, since they are able to efficiently redistribute gas, stars and angular momentum within their hosts, although it remains unclear whether they enhance or suppress star formation. A useful tool to investigate such an ambiguity is the Main Sequence (MS) relation, which tightly links stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) and star formation rate (SFR). The main goal of this work is to explore star formation processes in barred galaxies, in order to assess the relevance of possible bar quenching effects on the typical log-linear trend of the resolved MS. To this purpose, we carry out a spatially resolved analysis on sub-kpc scales for a sample of six nearby barred galaxies. Multi-wavelength photometric data (from far-UV to far-IR) are collected from the DustPedia database and a panchromatic Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting procedure is applied on square apertures of fixed angular size (8" $\times$ 8"), making use of the magphys code. For each galaxy we obtain the distributions of stellar mass and star formation rate surface densities and relate them in the $\log \Sigma_{\star}$ - $\log \Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ plane deriving the spatially resolved MS relation. Although significant galaxy-to-galaxy variations are in place, we infer the presence of a common anti-correlation track in correspondence with the bar-hosting region, which shows systematically lower values of SFR. Such a central quiescent signature can be interpreted as the result of a bar-driven depletion of gas reservoirs and a consequent halt of star formation. This seems to point in the direction of an inside-out quenching scenario.</description>

      <title>Study of the $\sim 50$ kpc circumgalactic environment around the merger system J2057-0030 at $z$ $\sim$ 4.6 using ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA band-7 observations of J2057-0030, a multi-component merger system at $z$ $\sim$ 4.68 spanning at least 50 kpc in size, using the [CII] $\lambda$157.74 $\mu$m line and underlying far-infrared (FIR) continuum. We find two main components, the quasar (QSO) and a dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG), both detected in [CII] and continuum emission as well as multiple neighboring clumps detected only in [CII]. Three of these clumps form a (tidal) tail that extends from the QSO in a straight direction to the west, covering a projected distance of $\sim$ 10 kpc. This perturbed morphology, added to a spatial distance of $\sim$ 20 kpc and a velocity offset of $\Delta{v}$ = 68 km s$^{-1}$ between the QSO and the DSFG, strongly supports a merging scenario. By fitting a spectral energy distribution model to the continuum data, we estimate star formation rates of $\approx$ 402 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the QSO host and $\approx$ 244 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the DSFG, which locate them on or close to the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. The J2057-0030 QSO was selected for being one of the brightest unobscured quasars at its redshift while presenting a rather modest star formation rate. Based on a commonly accepted paradigm regarding the formation of quasars, this result is expected for a quasar that has already passed an obscured phase of rapid star formation during a major merger. However, we see that the merger event in this system is far from being finished, and it is rather likely somewhere between the first pericenter and subsequent close passages. This is presumably another case of a high-$z$ quasar residing in a high-density environment with a companion obscured galaxy.</description>

      <title>Joint r-Process Enrichment by Supernovae with a Metallicity Threshold and Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enrichment history of $r$-process elements has been imprinted on the stellar abundances that change in accordance with increasing metallicity in galaxies. Close examination of the [Eu/Fe] feature caused by stars in nearby galaxies, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), shows its perplexity. The decreasing trend of the [Eu/Fe] feature is followed by a nearly constant value; this trend is generally attributed to an onset of the delayed Fe release from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which is the same interpretation of the [$\alpha$/Fe] feature. However, this feature appears in the LMC at [Fe/H] of approximately -0.7, which is significantly higher than that for the [alpha/Fe] case ($\approx$ -2). This result potentially indicates the presence of an overlooked property of the $r$-process site that remains unseen in the study of the Milky Way. Here, we propose that this [Eu/Fe]-knee feature is created by a fade-out of core-collapse SNe producing $r$-process elements; these elements along with neutron star mergers (NSMs) promote the $r$-process enrichment under the condition for this specific SNe such that their occurrence is limited to a low-metallicity environment. This metallicity threshold for the occurrence rate of $r$-process SNe at a subsolar is nearly identical to that for long gamma-ray bursts whose origin may be connected to fast-rotating massive stars. Moreover, we reason that the contribution of Eu from NSMs is crucial to maintain a high [Eu/Fe] at an early stage in dwarf galaxies by a balance with Fe from SNe Ia; both enrichments via NSMs and SNe Ia proceed with similar delay time distributions.</description>

      <title>Kinematic and metallicity of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda XVIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andromeda XVIII is an isolated dwarf galaxy 579 kpc away from the nearest large galaxy, M31. It is a candidate ``backsplash galaxy'' that might have been affected by a close passage to M31. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of Andromeda XVIII to assess the likelihood that it is a backsplash galaxy. We estimated the velocities, metallicities ([Fe/H]), and $\alpha$-enhancements ([$\alpha$/Fe]) for 56 probable members. We estimated Andromeda XVIII's mean heliocentric velocity, rotation velocity, position angle of the rotation axis, and velocity dispersion using maximum likelihood coupled with a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC). There is no evidence for bulk rotation, though sub-populations might be rotating. The mean heliocentric velocity is -337.2 km s$^{-1}$. The line-of-sight velocity relative to M31 is -36 km s$^{-1}$ (approaching), which is lower than the escape velocity from M31. Based on the abundances of 38 stars with low errors ($\delta [Fe/H] &lt; 0.3$) compared to a total of 56 probable members, parameters for the simplest chemical evolution models were estimated using maximum likelihood coupled with an MCMC. The metallicity distribution is inconsistent with these models due to a sharp metal-rich cut-off. Together, the metallicity distribution and the mean velocity are consistent with a sudden interruption of star formation. One possible cause for this quenching may be rapid gas loss due to ram pressure stripping during a close passage by M31 in the past. We also consider a past major merger as another possible cause.</description>

      <title>Transitory tidal heating and its impact on cluster isochrones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic energy in tidal flows, when converted into heat, can affect the internal structure of a star and shift its location on a color-magnitude diagram from that of standard models. In this paper we explore the impact of injecting heat into stars with masses near the main sequence turnoff mass (1.26 $M_\odot$) of the open cluster M67. The heating rate is obtained from the tidal shear energy dissipation rate which is calculated from first principles by simultaneously solving the equations that describe orbital motion and the response of a star's layers to the gravitational, Coriolis, centrifugal, gas pressure and viscous forces. The stellar structure models are computed with MESA. We focus on the effects of injecting heat in pulses lasting 0.01 Gyr, a timeframe consistent with the synchonization timescale in binary systems. We find that the location of the tidally perturbed stars in the M67 color-magnitude diagram is shifted to significantly higher luminosities and effective temperatures than predicted by the standard model isochrone and include locations corresponding to some of the Blue Straggler Stars. Because tidal heating takes energy from the orbit causing it to shrink, Blue Straggler Stars could be merger or mass-transfer progenitors as well as products of these processes.</description>

      <title>Dark supernova remnant buried in the Galactic-Centre "Brick" G0.253+0.016 revealed by an expanding CO-line bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a $^{12}$CO- and $^{13}$CO($J=1-0$)-line study of the "Brick" (G0.253+0.016) in the Galactic Centre (GC) by analyzing the archival data obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. We present kinematics and molecular gas distributions in the longitude-velocity diagrams, and suggest that the Brick is located along the GC Arm I in the central molecular zone (CMZ) in front of the GC, which yields a distance of 8 kpc and GC radius 0.2 kpc. The major and minor-axis diameters of the Brick are $D_x\times D_y=8.4 \ {\rm pc} \times 4.1 \ {\rm pc}$, and the scale radius is $r_{\rm bri}=\sqrt{D_x D_y}=2.96$ pc. The molecular mass inferred from the CO-line integrated intensity is $M_{\rm brixco} \sim 5.1\times 10^4 M_\odot$ for a conversion factor $X_{\rm gc}=1.0\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$, while the Virial mass for the velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=10.0 $ km s $^{-1}$ is calculated to be $M_{\rm brivir}\sim 6.8 \times 10^4 \ M_\odot$, which yields a new conversion factor of $X_{\rm bri} =1.3\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$. No thermal radio emission indicative of HII region and star formation is found in radio-continuum archive. The Brick's center has a cavity surrounded by a spherical molecular bubble of radius $r_{\rm bub}=1.85$ pc and mass $\sim 1.7\times 10^4 M_\odot$ expanding at $v_{\rm exp}=10$ km s$^{-1}$ with kinetic energy of $E_0\sim 1.7\times 10^{49}$ erg. If the bubble is approximated by an adiabatic spherical shock wave, its age is $t\sim 2/5 r_{\rm bub}/v_{\rm exp}\sim 7.2\times 10^4$ y. We suggest that the bubble will be a dark supernova remnant buried in the dense molecular cloud. The Brick, therefore, experienced massive-star formation followed by a supernova explosion more than $\sim 10^5$ y ago.</description>

      <title>A Self-Consistent Treatment of the Line-Driving Radiation Force for Active Galactic Nuclei Outflows: New Prescriptions for Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flows driven by photons have been studied for almost a century, and a quantitative description of the radiative forces on atoms and ions is important for understanding a wide variety of systems with outflows and accretion disks, such as active galactic nuclei. Quantifying the associated forces is crucial to determining how these outflows enable interactive mechanisms within these environments, such as AGN feedback. The total number of spectral lines in any given ion of the outflow material must be tabulated in order to give a complete characterization of this force. Here we provide calculations of the dimensionless line force multiplier for AGN environments. For a wide array of representative AGN sources, we explicitly calculate the photoionization balance at the proposed wind-launching region above the accretion disk, compute the strength of the line-driving force on the gas, and revisit and formalize the role of the commonly-used ionization parameter $\xi$ in ultimately determining the line-driving force. We perform these computations and analyses for a variety of AGN central source properties, such as black hole mass, initial wind velocity, and number density. We find that, while useful, the ionization parameter provides an incomplete description of the overall ionization state of the outflow material. We use these findings to provide an updated method for calculating the strength of the radiative line-driving using both the X-ray spectral index $\Gamma_X$ and the ionization parameter.</description>

      <title>Detection and prebiotic chemistry of possible glycine precursor molecule methylenimine towards the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amino acids are essential for the synthesis of protein. Amino acids contain both amine (R$-$NH$_{2}$) and carboxylic acid (R$-$COOH) functional groups, which help to understand the possible formation mechanism of life in the universe. Among the 20 types of amino acids, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH) is known as the simplest non-essential amino acid. In the last 40 years, all surveys of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium, especially in the star-formation regions, have failed at the millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. We aimed to identify the possible precursors of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH, because it is highly challenging to identify NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium. Many laboratory experiments have suggested that methylenimine (CH$_{2}$NH) plays a key role as a possible precursor of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the star-formation regions via the Strecker synthesis reaction. After spectral analysis using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, we successfully identified the rotational emission lines of CH$_{2}$NH towards the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). The estimated column density of CH$_{2}$NH towards G10.47+0.03 is (3.40$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ with a rotational temperature of 218.70$\pm$20 K, which is estimated from the rotational diagram. The fractional abundance of CH$_{2}$NH with respect to H$_{2}$ towards G10.47+0.03 is 2.61$\times$10$^{-8}$. We found that the derived abundance of CH$_{2}$NH agree fairly well with the existing two-phase warm-up chemical modelling abundance value of CH$_{2}$NH. We discuss the possible formation pathways of CH$_{2}$NH within the context of hot molecular cores, and we find that CH$_{2}$NH is likely mainly formed via neutral-neutral gas-phase reactions of CH$_{3}$ and NH radicals towards G10.47+0.03.</description>

      <title>Star-by-star dynamical evolution of the physical pair of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper using Gaia DR2 data, we demonstrated that the two closely situated open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 might have formed together about 50 Myr ago. In this work, we performed star-by-star dynamical modelling of the evolution of the open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 from their supposed initial state to their present-day state, reproducing observational distributions of members. Modelling of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 dynamical evolution was done using the high-order parallel N-body code \phi-GPU with up-to-date stellar evolution. Membership and characteristics of the clusters were acquired based on Gaia DR3 data. The comparison of the present-day radial cumulative star count obtained from the N-body simulations with the current observational data gave us full consistency of the model with observational data, especially in the central 8 pc, where 80% of the stars reside. The proper motion velocity components obtained from the N-body simulations of the stars are also quite consistent with the observed distributions and error bars. These results show that our numerical modelling is able to reproduce the open clusters' current complex 6D observed phase-space distributions with a high level of confidence. Thus, the model demonstrates that the hypothesis of a common origin of Collinder 135 and UBC 7 complies with present-day observational data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Identification of Broad Absorption Line Quasars using Dimensionality Reduction and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad Absorption Line Quasars (BALQSOs) displaying distinct blue-shifted broad absorption lines. These serve as invaluable probes for unraveling the intricate structure and evolution of quasars, shedding light on the profound influence exerted by supermassive black holes on galaxy formation. The proliferation of large-scale spectroscopic surveys such as LAMOST, SDSS, and DESI has exponentially expanded the repository of quasar spectra at our disposal. In this study, we present an innovative approach to streamline the identification of BALQSOs, leveraging the power of dimensionality reduction and machine learning algorithms. Our dataset is curated from the SDSS DR16, amalgamating quasar spectra with classification labels sourced from the DR16Q quasar catalog. We employ a diverse array of dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP), to distill the essence of the original spectral data. The resultant low-dimensional representations serve as inputs for a suite of machine learning classifiers, including XGBoost and Random Forest models. Through experimentation, we unveil PCA as the most effective dimensionality reduction methodology, adeptly navigating the intricate balance between dimensionality reduction and preservation of vital spectral information. Notably, the synergistic fusion of PCA with the XGBoost classifier emerges as the pinnacle of efficacy in the BALQSO classification endeavor, boasting impressive accuracy rates of 97.60% by 10-cross validation and 96.92% on the outer test sample. This study not only introduces a novel machine learning-based paradigm for quasar classification but also offers invaluable insights transferrable to a myriad of spectral classification challenges pervasive in the realm of astronomy.</description>

      <title>Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph -- Distant Quasar Survey: Rest-Frame Ultraviolet-Optical Spectral Properties of Broad Absorption Line Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the rest-frame ultraviolet-optical spectral properties of 65 broad absorption line (BAL) quasars from the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph-Distant Quasar Survey (GNIRS-DQS). These properties are compared with those of 195 non-BAL quasars from GNIRS-DQS in order to identify the drivers for the appearance of BALs in quasar spectra. In particular, we compare equivalent widths and velocity widths, as well as velocity offsets from systemic redshifts, of principal emission lines. In spite of the differences between their rest-frame ultraviolet spectra, we find that luminous BAL quasars are generally indistinguishable from their non-BAL counterparts in the rest-frame optical band at redshifts $1.55 \lesssim z \lesssim 3.50$. We do not find any correlation between BAL trough properties and the H$\beta$-based supermassive black hole masses and normalized accretion rates in our sample. Considering the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar sample, which includes the GNIRS-DQS sample, we find that a monochromatic luminosity at rest-frame 2500 A of $\gtrsim 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is a necessary condition for launching BAL outflows in quasars. We compare our findings with other BAL quasar samples and discuss the roles that accretion rate and orientation play in the appearance of BAL troughs in quasar spectra.</description>

      <title>A link to the past: characterizing wandering black holes in Milky Way-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A population of non-stellar black holes ($\gtrsim$100 M$_{\odot}$) has been long predicted to wander the Milky Way. We aim to characterize this population by using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model applied on top of the high resolution Millennium-II merger trees. Our results predict $\sim$10 wandering black holes with masses $\sim$2 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ in a typical $z$ = 0 Milky Way galaxy, accounting for $\sim$2$\%$ of the total non-stellar black hole mass budget of the galaxy. We find that the locations of these wanderers correlate with their formation scenario. While the ones concentrated at $\lesssim$1 kpc from the galactic nucleus on the disk come from past galactic mergers, the ones formed as a consequence of ejections due to gravitational recoils or the disruption of satellite galaxies are typically located at $\gtrsim$100 kpc. Such small and large distances might explain the absence of strong observational evidence for wandering black holes in the Milky Way. Our results also indicate that $\sim$67$\%$ of the wandering population is conformed by the leftovers of black hole seeds that had little to no growth since their formation. We find that wandering black holes that are leftover seeds become wanderers at an earlier time with respect to grown seeds, and also come from more metal-poor galaxies. Finally, we show that the number of wandering black holes in a Milky Way-type galaxy depends on the seeding efficiency.</description>

      <title>Searching for Free-Floating Planets with TESS: I. Discovery of a First Terrestrial-Mass Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though free-floating planets (FFPs) that have been ejected from their natal star systems may outpopulate their bound counterparts in the terrestrial-mass range, they remain one of the least explored exoplanet demographics. Due to their negligible electromagnetic emission at all wavelengths, the only observational technique able to detect these worlds is gravitational microlensing. Microlensing by terrestrial-mass FFPs induces rare, short-duration magnifications of background stars, requiring high-cadence, wide-field surveys to detect these events. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), though designed to detect close-bound exoplanets via the transit technique, boasts a cadence as short as 200 seconds and has monitored hundreds of millions of stars, making it well-suited to search for short-duration microlensing events as well. We have used existing data products from the TESS Quick-Look Pipeline (QLP) to perform a preliminary search for FFP microlensing candidates in 1.3 million light curves from TESS Sector 61. We find one compelling candidate associated with TIC-107150013, a source star at $d_s = 3.194$ kpc. The event has a duration $t_E = 0.074^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$ days and shows prominent finite-source features ($\rho = 4.55^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$), making it consistent with an FFP in the terrestrial-mass range. This exciting result indicates that our ongoing search through all TESS sectors has the opportunity to shed new light on this enigmatic population of worlds.</description>

      <title>General non-linear fragmentation with discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust grains play a significant role in several astrophysical processes, including gas/dust dynamics, chemical reactions, and radiative transfer. Replenishment of small-grain populations is mainly governed by fragmentation during pair-wise collisions between grains. The wide spectrum of fragmentation outcomes, from complete disruption to erosion and/or mass transfer, can be modelled by the general non-linear fragmentation equation. Efficiently solving this equation is crucial for an accurate treatment of the dust fragmentation in numerical modelling. However, similar to dust coagulation, numerical errors in current fragmentation algorithms employed in astrophysics are dominated by the numerical over-diffusion problem -- particularly in 3D hydrodynamic simulations where the discrete resolution of the mass density distribution tends to be highly limited. With this in mind, we have derived the first conservative form of the general non-linear fragmentation with a mass flux highlighting the mass transfer phenomenon. Then, to address cases of limited mass density resolution, we applied a high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme to efficiently solve the conservative fragmentation equation with a reduced number of dust bins. An accuracy of 0.1 -1% is reached with 20 dust bins spanning a mass range of 9 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Inflation and Dark Sector from 11D Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore compactifications of the form of three tori and one circle in the framework of 11D supergravity. By imposing suitable gauge conditions and boundary conditions, we find that the four-dimensional FRW universe emerges as a solution representing cosmological D3-branes in the eleven-dimensional bulk. These specific compactification methods can produce cosmological inflation that aligns with the observational constraints set by the 2021 BICEP/Keck and Planck 2018 results. In the cosmological inflation models we construct, the inflaton can be interpreted as the conformal vibrations of extra dimensions with a size around 10^5 times the reduced Planck length. Additionally, we offer the theoretical predictions for the mass of the inflaton, and the tree-level Newton's gravity law between two massive point particles surrounded by a spherically symmetric distribution of the inflaton, which can reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation and explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Resolved magnetohydrodynamic wave lensing in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic wave lensing, a common physical phenomenon recognized in visible light for centuries, finds extensive applications in manipulating light in optical systems such as telescopes and cameras. Magnetohydrodynamic wave is a common perturbation phenomenon in the corona. By using high spatio-temporal resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, here, we report the observation of a magnetohydrodynamic wave lensing in the highly ionized and magnetized coronal plasma, where quasi-periodic wavefronts emanated from a flare converged at a specific point after traversing a coronal hole. The entire process resembles an electromagnetic wave lensing from the source to the focus. Meanwhile, the magnetohydrodynamic wave lensing is well reproduced through a magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulation with full spatio-temporal resolution. We further investigate potential applications for coronal seismology, as the lensing process encodes information on the Alfv\'en speed, in conjunction with favorable geometric and density variations.</description>

      <title>Images of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick magnetized equilibrium tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt general relativistic ray-tracing (GRRT) schemes to study images of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick magnetized equilibrium tori, which belong to steady-state solutions of thick accretion disks within the framework of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). The black hole possesses an extra dimensionless MOG parameter described its deviation from usual Kerr one. Our results show that the presence of the MOG parameter leads to smaller disks in size, but enhances the total flux density and peak brightness in their images. Combining with observation data of black hole M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), we make a constraint on parameters of the Kerr-MOG black hole and find that the presence of the MOG parameter broadens the allowable range of black hole spin.</description>

      <title>A New Computational Method for Energetic Particle Acceleration and Transport with its Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a new computational method to explore astrophysical and heliophysical phenomena, especially those considerably influenced by non-thermal energetic particles. This novel approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating the non-thermal fluid pressure into Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the non-thermal fluid is evaluated from the energetic particle distribution evolved through Parker's transport equation, which is solved using stochastic differential equations. We implement this method in the HOW-MHD code (Seo \&amp; Ryu 2023), which achieves 5th-order accuracy. We find that without spatial diffusion, the method accurately reproduces the Riemann solution in the hydrodynamic shock tube test when including the non-thermal pressure. Solving Parker's transport equation allows the determination of pressure terms for both relativistic and non-relativistic non-thermal fluids with adiabatic indices $\gamma_{\rm{NT}}=4/3$ and $\gamma_{\rm{NT}}=5/3$, respectively. The method also successfully replicates the Magnetohydrodynamic shock tube test with non-thermal pressure, successfully resolving the discontinuities within a few cells. Introducing spatial diffusion of non-thermal particles leads to marginal changes in the shock but smooths the contact discontinuity. Importantly, this method successfully simulates the energy spectrum of the non-thermal particles accelerated through shock, which includes feedback from the non-thermal population. These results demonstrate that this method is very powerful for studying particle acceleration when a significant portion of the plasma energy is taken by energetic particles.</description>

      <title>VELOcities of CEpheids (VELOCE) I. High-precision radial velocities of Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This first VELOCE data release comprises 18,225 high-precision RV measurements of 258 bona fide classical Cepheids on both hemispheres collected mainly between 2010 and 2022, alongside 1161 additional observations of 164 other stars. The median per-observation RV uncertainty is 0.037 km/s, and some reach 0.002 km/s. Non-variable standard stars characterize RV zero-point stability and provide a base for future cross-calibrations. We determined zero-point differences between VELOCE and 31 literature data sets using template fitting and measured linear period changes of 146 Cepheids. Seventy six spectroscopic binary Cepheids and 14 candidates are identified using VELOCE data alone and are investigated in detail in a companion paper (VELOCE II). Several new insights into Cepheid pulsations were obtained, including: a) the most detailed description of the Hertzsprung progression by RVs; b) the identification of double-peaked bumps in the RV curve; c) clear evidence that virtually all Cepheids feature spectroscopic variability signals that lead to modulated RV variability. We identified 36 such stars, of which 4 also exhibit orbital motion. Linear radius variations depend strongly on pulsation period and a steep increase in slope of the $\Delta$R/p versus logP-relation is found near 10d, challenging the existence of a tight relation between Baade-Wesselink projection factors and pulsation periods. We investigated the accuracy of RV time series measurements, v$_\gamma$, and RV amplitudes published in Gaia's DR3 and determined an average offset of 0.65 \pm 0.11 km/s relative to VELOCE. We recommend adopting a single set of template correlation parameters for distinct classes of large-amplitude variable stars to avoid systematic offsets in v$_\gamma$ among stars belonging to the same class. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of Gaia RVs exhibit significant (16%) dispersion compared to VELOCE. [abridged]</description>

      <title>On the roles of stellar rotation and binarity in NGC 2423's main-sequence turnoff region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research has shown that many young and intermediate-age clusters (younger than $\sim$2 Gyr) have extended main sequences and main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs), which cannot be adequately described by a single isochrone. The reason for the extended main sequences is now known, with the most probable cause being the fast rotation of stars. However, a significant fraction of slowly rotating stars form a younger stellar population than their fast-rotating counterparts, leading to speculation that they have undergone thorough rotational mixing processes internally. One speculation is that a considerable number of slowly rotating stars reside in close binary systems, where tidal forces from companion stars are the cause of their rotational deceleration. In this work, we report a relatively old open star cluster in the Milky Way, NGC 2423 ($\sim$1 Gyrs old), which exhibits an apparent eMSTO. As anticipated, many characteristics of NGC 2423 indicate that its eMSTO is driven by stellar rotations. Our calculations indicate that if slowly rotating stars commonly have a close companion star, they should exhibit significant differences in radial velocities observationally, and binary systems that can be tidally locked within the age of NGC 2423 should have a mass ratio close to 1. However, none of these predictions align with our observations. Interestingly, among the only two equal-mass binary systems in the observed region for which spectroscopic data could be obtained, we discovered that one of them is a tidally locked binary system. This further suggests the validity of our numerical simulation results.</description>

      <title>Ciii]$\lambda1909$ emission as an alternative to Ly$\alpha$ in the reionization era: the dependence of Ciii] and Ly$\alpha$ at $3&lt;z&lt;4$ from the VANDELS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The velocity offset of Ly$\alpha$ emission from a galaxy's systemic redshift is an excellent tracer of conditions that enable the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons from the galaxy, and potentially hydrogen ionizing Lyman continuum photons. However at $z\geq6$, Ly$\alpha$ is often heavily attenuated by the neutral intergalactic medium. Here we investigate the utility of Ciii],$\lambda\lambda1907,1909$ emission, usually the brightest UV line after Ly$\alpha$, as a proxy estimating the Ly$\alpha$ velocity offset ($\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$). To do so, we use analogues of reionization era galaxies based upon 52 star-forming galaxies with robust Ciii] detections drawn from the VANDELS survey. Our sample spans a broad UV magnitude range of $-18.5 &lt; M_{\rm{UV}} &lt; -22.0$, with a sample average value of EW(Ciii]) $=5.3$\,{\AA}. We find a slight increase of EW(Ciii]) with increasing EW(Ly$\alpha$), but find a large range of EW(Ciii]) $\sim$1-13\,{\AA} particularly at EW(Ly$\alpha$) $&lt;10$\,{\AA}. Using the Ciii] line peak as the systemic redshift, we calculate $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$ and recover the previously reported trend of decreasing $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$ with increasing EW(Ly$\alpha$). Interestingly, we find an anti-correlation between $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$ and EW(Ciii]), which also displays a dependence on the UV absolute magnitude. We derive a multi-variate fit to obtain $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$ using both EW(Ciii]) and $M_{\rm{UV}}$, finding that $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$ is more strongly dependent on EW(Ciii]), with a weaker but non-negligible dependence on $M_{\rm{UV}}$. We find that for a fixed EW(Ciii]), UV-bright Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies show smaller values of $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$,which suggests that such galaxies may be undergoing more bursty star-formation compared to the UV-fainter ones, akin to a population of extremely UV-bright galaxies identified at $z&gt;10$.</description>

      <title>Project Dinos I: A joint lensing-dynamics constraint on the deviation from the power law in the mass profile of massive ellipticals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass distribution in massive elliptical galaxies encodes their evolutionary history, thus providing an avenue to constrain the baryonic astrophysics in their evolution. The power-law assumption for the radial mass profile in ellipticals has been sufficient to describe several observables to the noise level, including strong lensing and stellar dynamics. In this paper, we quantitatively constrained any deviation, or the lack thereof, from the power-law mass profile in massive ellipticals through joint lensing-dynamics analysis of a large statistical sample with 77 galaxy-galaxy lens systems. We performed an improved and uniform lens modelling of these systems from archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging using the automated lens modelling pipeline dolphin. We combined the lens model posteriors with the stellar dynamics to constrain the deviation from the power law after accounting for the line-of-sight lensing effects, a first for analyses on galaxy-galaxy lenses. We find that the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS) lens galaxies with a mean redshift of 0.2 are consistent with the power-law profile within 1.1$\sigma$ (2.8$\sigma$) and the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S) lens galaxies with a mean redshift of 0.6 are consistent within 0.8$\sigma$ (2.1$\sigma$), for a spatially constant (Osipkov-Merritt) stellar anisotropy profile. We adopted the spatially constant anisotropy profile as our baseline choice based on previous dynamical observables of local ellipticals. However, spatially resolved stellar kinematics of lens galaxies are necessary to differentiate between the two anisotropy models. Future studies will use our lens models to constrain the mass distribution individually in the dark matter and baryonic components.</description>

Abstract: In our previous work, we derive the CR-IGIMF: a new scenario for a variable stellar initial mass function (IMF), which combines numerical results on the role played by cosmic rays in setting the thermal state of star forming gas, with the analytical approach of the integrated galaxy-wide IMF. In this work, we study the implications of this scenario for the properties of local Early-Type galaxies (ETG), as inferred from dynamical, photometric and spectroscopic studies. We implement a library of CR-IGIMF shapes in the framework of the Galaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model. Our realization includes a derivation of synthetic spectral energy distribution for each model galaxy, allowing a direct derivation of the mass fraction in the mean IMF of low-mass stars (i.e. the dwarf-to-giant ratio - $\rm f_{dg}$) and a comparison with IMF sensitive spectral features. The predictions of the GAEA model implementing the CR-IGIMF confirm our previous findings: it correctly reproduces both the observed excess of z$\sim$0 dynamical mass (mass-to-light ratios) with respect to spectroscopic (photometric) estimates assuming a universal, MW-like, IMF, and the observed increase of [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios with stellar mass in spheroidal galaxies. Moreover, this realization reproduces the increasing trends of $\rm f_{dg}$, and IMF-sensitive line-strengths with velocity dispersion, although the predicted relations are significantly shallower than the observed ones. Our results show that the CR-IGIMF is a promising scenario that reproduces at the same time dynamical, photometric and spectroscopic indications of a varying IMF in local ETGs. The shallow relations found for spectral indices suggest that either a stronger variability as a function of galaxy properties or additional dependences (e.g. as a function of star forming gas metallicity) might be required to match the strength of the observed trends.</description>

      <title>Simulated host galaxy analogs of high-z quasars observed with JWST</title>

Abstract: The hosts of two low-luminosity high-z quasars, J2255+0251 and J2236+0032, were recently detected using JWST's NIRCam instrument. These represent the first high-z quasar host galaxy stellar detections and open a new window into studying high-z quasars. We examine the implications of the measured properties of J2255+0251 and J2236+0032 within the context of the hydrodynamic simulation BlueTides at z = 6.5. We find that these observed quasars fall on the BlueTides stellar to black hole mass relation and have similar luminosities to the brightest simulated quasars. We predict their star formation rates, estimating approximately $10^{2-3}$ $M_{\odot}/ \rm yr$ for both quasar hosts. J2255+0251 and J2236+0032's host galaxy radii also fall within estimates of the radii of the simulated host galaxies of similar luminosity quasars. We generate mock JWST NIRCam images of analogs to the observed quasars within BlueTides and perform a point source removal to illustrate both a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the measured and simulated radii and magnitudes. The quasar subtraction works well for similar luminosity quasars, and the recovered host images are consistent with what was observed for J2255+0251 and J2236+0032, further supporting the success of those observations. We also use our mock imaging pipeline to make predictions for the detection of J2255+0251 and J2236+0032's hosts in upcoming JWST observations. We anticipate that the simulation analogs of future high-z quasar host discoveries will allow us to make accurate predictions of their properties beyond the capabilities of JWST.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the escape of Ly$\alpha$ at $z\approx 5-6$: a census of Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction with H$\alpha$ emitting galaxies spectroscopically confirmed by JWST and VLT/MUSE</title>

Abstract: JWST provides an unprecedented opportunity for unbiased surveys of H$\alpha$-emitting galaxies at $z&gt;4$ with the NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS). In this work, we present a census of Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$) of 165 star-forming galaxies at $z=4.9-6.3$ using their H$\alpha$ emission directly measured from FRESCO NIRCam/WFSS data. We search for Ly$\alpha$ emission of each H$\alpha$-emitting galaxy in VLT/MUSE data. The overall $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ measured by stacking is $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ is $0.090\pm0.006$. We find that $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ displays a strong dependence on the observed UV slope ($\beta_{\rm obs}$) and E(B-V), such that the bluest galaxies ($\beta_{\rm obs}\sim-2.5$) have the largest escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc, Ly\alpha}\approx0.6$), indicative of the crucial role of dust and gas in modulating the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons. $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ is less well related to other parameters, including the UV luminosity and stellar mass, and the variation in $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ with them can be explained by their underlying coupling with E(B-V) or $\beta_{\rm obs}$. Our results suggest a tentative decline in $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ at $z\gtrsim 5$, implying increasing intergalactic medium attenuation towards higher redshift. Furthermore, the dependence of $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ on $\beta_{\rm obs}$ is proportional to that of the ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc, LyC}$), indicating the escape of Ly$\alpha$ and ionizing photon may be regulated by similar physical processes. With $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ as a proxy to $f_{\rm esc, LyC}$, we infer that UV-faint ($M_{\rm UV}&gt;-16$) galaxies contribute $&gt;70\%$ of the total ionizing emissivity at $z=5-6$. If these relations hold during the epoch of reionization, UV-faint galaxies can contribute the majority of UV photon budget to reionize the Universe.</description>

      <title>Some Old Globular Clusters (and Stars) Inferring That the Universe Is Older Than Commonly Accepted</title>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has made startling discoveries regarding the early universe. It has revealed galaxies as soon as 300 million years after the Big Bang, challenging current galaxy formation models. Additionally, it has identified massive, bright galaxies in the young universe, contradicting the standard {\Lambda}CDM model's age estimate of 13.8 Gyr. This prompts a reevaluation of galaxy formation and cosmological models. There is a strong tension between JWST high-redshift galaxy observations and Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) satellite measurements. Even alternative cosmological models, including those incorporating dark matter baryon interaction, f(R) gravity, and dynamical dark have failed to resolve this tension. One possible solution is that the Universe's age exceeds predictions by the {\Lambda}CDM model. The study challenges this by introducing a method based on blue straggler stars (BSs) within GCs, comparing ages with other models. The ages obtained are compared with those of different models to certify that they are equally valid. These values are comparable within the error ranges except for the clusters: NGC104, NGC 5634, IC 4499, NGC 6273 and NGC 4833, finding their respective ages to be between 14.7 and 21.6 Gyr, surpassing the commonly accepted age of the Universe. These results inferred an age for the Universe of around 26 Gyr, close to 26.7 Gyr. This value aligns with that suggested by the cosmological model named Covarying Coupling Constants + TL (CCC+TL). Such a value is consistent with early universe observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The results of the present paper reinforce the advocating for a critical review of models encompassing dark mass, dark energy, and the dynamics of the Universe, particularly in explaining the presence of primitive massive galaxies, very old GCs, and very old and poor metallic stars.</description>

Abstract: Radio galaxies in clusters of galaxies are prominent reservoirs of magnetic fields and of non-thermal particles, which get mixed with the intracluster medium. We review the observational and theoretical knowledge of the role of these crucial ingredients for the formation of diffuse radio emission in clusters (radio halos, relics, mini halos) and outline the open questions in this field.</description>

      <title>GHOST Commissioning Science Results III: Characterizing an iron-poor damped Lyman $\alpha$ system</title>

Abstract: The Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) is a new echelle spectrograph available on the Gemini-South telescope as of Semester 2024A. We present the first high resolution spectrum of the quasar J1449-1227 (redshift z_em=3.27) using data taken during the commissioning of GHOST. The observed quasar hosts an intervening iron-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.5) damped Lyman alpha (DLA) system at redshift z=2.904. Taking advantage of the high spectral resolving power of GHOST (R~55000), we are able to accurately model the metal absorption lines of the metal-poor DLA and find a supersolar [Si/Fe], suggesting the DLA gas is in an early stage of chemical enrichment. Using simple ionization models, we find that the large range in the C IV/Si IV column density ratio of individual components within the DLA's high ionization absorption profile can be reproduced by several metal-poor Lyman limit systems surrounding the low-ionization gas of the DLA. It is possible that this metal-poor DLA resides within a complex system of metal-poor galaxies or filaments with inflowing gas. The high spectral resolution, wavelength coverage and sensitivity of GHOST makes it an ideal spectrograph for characterizing the chemistry and kinematics of quasar absorption lines.</description>

      <title>Vorticity and magnetic dynamo from subsonic expansion waves II: Dependence on magnetic Prandtl number, forcing scale, cooling time</title>

Abstract: The amplification of astrophysical magnetic fields takes place via dynamo instability in turbulent environments. The presence of vorticity is crucial for the dynamo to happen. However, the role of vorticity is not yet fully understood. This work is an extension of previous research on the effect of an irrotational subsonic forcing on a magnetized medium in the presence of rotation or a differential velocity profile, aimed at exploring a wider parameter space in terms of Reynolds numbers, magnetic Prandtl number, forcing scale, cooling timescale in a Newtonian cooling. We study the effect of imposing either the acceleration or the velocity forcing function to be curl-free and evaluate the terms responsible for the evolution vorticity. We use Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) to solve the fully compressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations with the Pencil Code. We study both isothermal and non-isothermal regimes and address the relative importance of different vorticity source terms.We report no small-scale dynamo for the models that do not include shear. We find a hydro instability, followed by a magnetic one, when a shearing velocity profile is applied. The vorticity production is found to be numerical in the purely irrotational case. Non-isothermality, rotation, shear or forcing in the form of a velocity curl-free, when included, contribute to increasing vorticity. Consistently with our previous study, we find that turbulence driven by subsonic expansion waves can amplify vorticity and magnetic field only in the presence of a background shearing profile. The presence of a cooling function make the instability happens on a shorter timescale. We estimate critical Reynolds and Magnetic Reynolds Numbes of 40 and 20, respectively.</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$ Reverberation Mapping from Broad-band Photometry of Dwarf Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 4395</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NGC 4395 is a dwarf Seyfert 1 galaxy with a possible intermediate-mass black hole of several $\rm{10^4}$ solar masses in its center. As a well-studied object, its broad line region size has been measured via H$\rm{\alpha}$ time lag in numerous spectroscopic reverberation mapping (SRM) and narrow-band photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) campaigns. Here we present its H$\rm{\alpha}$ time lag measurement using broad-band photometric data, with the application of our newly-developed ICCF-Cut method as well as the JAVELIN and $\chi ^2$ methods. utilizing the minute-cadence multi-band light curves obtained from the $\rm{2}$m FTN and $\rm{10.4}$m GTC telescopes in recent works, we measured its H$\rm{\alpha}$ lag as approximately $40 \sim 90$ minutes from broad-band PRM. With the H$\rm{\alpha}$ emission line velocity dispersion, we calculated its central black hole mass as $\rm M_{\rm BH} = (8\pm4) \times 10^3\, M_{\rm \odot}$. These results are comparable with previous results obtained by narrow-band PRM and SRM, providing further support to an intermediate-mass black hole in NGC 4395. In addition, our study also validates the ICCF-Cut as an effective method for broad-band PRM, which holds the potential for widespread application in the era of large multi-epoch, high-cadence photometric surveys.</description>
