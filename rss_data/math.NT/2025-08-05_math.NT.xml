      <title>Narayana numbers that are products of two Fibonacci numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{N_m\}_{m\ge0}$ be the Narayana's cows sequence given by $N_0=0$, $N_1=1=N_2=1$ and \[ N_{m+3}=N_{m+2}+N_m,\quad \text{ for }\; m\geq 0 \] and let $\{F_n\}_{n\ge0}$ be the Fibonacci sequence. In this paper we solve explicitely the Diophantine equation \[ N_m=F_nF_k, \] in positive unknowns $m,\,n$ and $k$. That is, we find the non-zero narayana numbers that are products of two Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <title>An effective analytic recurrence for prime numbers: from asymptotics to explicit bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit and effective recurrence formula for prime numbers, bridging arithmetic and analytic approaches. Building upon foundational work by Gandhi (1971), Golomb (1976), and Keller (2007), we establish the effective bound $s_n \le 2p_n$ for all $n \ge 1$ within the Golomb-Keller analytic recurrence. This transforms their asymptotic formula into an explicit recurrence using twice the n-th prime as the exponent: $$ p_{n+1} = \left\lceil \left( -1 + \zeta(2p_n) \prod_{j=1}^{n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_j^{2p_n}}\right) \right)^{-1/(2p_n)} \right\rceil $$ The proof is self-contained and relies on Bertrand's postulate. We also present strong numerical and heuristic evidence for a sharper conjecture: $s_n \le p_n$ for all $n \ge 1$, suggesting that the formula works with the n-th prime as the exponent.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive the following asymptotic formula $$ \mathop{{\sum}'}_{n\leqslant x}\dfrac{r(n)}{r(n+1)} = {x}{(\ln x)^{-3/4}}(c+o(1)),\ \ x \to +\infty,$$ where $r(n)$ is the number of representations of $n$ as a sum of two squares, $c$ is a positive constant, and the prime indicates summation over those $n$ for which $r(n+1)\neq 0$.</description>

Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to be divisible by a cyclotomic polynomials and derive new formulas involving Ramanujan sums as an application of our results. Additionally, we provide new insights into the coefficients of cyclotomic polynomials and we propose a recursive relation between the coefficients of two cyclotomic polynomials whose indexes differ by a prime factor.</description>

      <title>Slopes of modular forms and the Ghost conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an algorithm to compute the slope sequence of modular forms with fixed Galois components from its first few entries, which is a refined version of the conjecture of [Buz05]. We use the results of arXiv:2302.07697 on the ghost conjecture from axXiv:1710.01572. These symmetries in slope sequences have potential implication to unexplained symmetries in many Coleman-Mazur eigencurves.</description>

      <title>Small gaps between Goldbach primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study small gaps between Goldbach primes $\mathbb{P} \cap (N-\mathbb{P})$ using the Bombieri-Davenport method and the Maynard-Tao method, and compare the two.
  We show that for almost all even integers $N$, the smallest gap in $\mathbb{P} \cap (N-\mathbb{P})$ can be $0.765...$ times smaller than the average gap using the Bombieri-Davenport method. This is an improvement on a recent result of Tsuda. We also demonstrate that a straightforward application of the Maynard-Tao method is insufficient to improve this bound. However, it allows us to establish the existence of bounded gaps between Goldbach primes with bounded error for almost all even integers $N$.</description>

      <title>Numbers with Four Close Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study numbers $n$ that can be factored in four different ways as $n = A B = (A + a_1) (B - b_1) = (A + a_2) (B - b_2) = (A + a_3) (B - b_3)$ with $B \le A$, $1 \le a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; a_3 \le C$ and $1 \le b_1 &lt; b_2 &lt; b_3 \le C$. We obtain the optimal upper bound $A \le 0.04742 \ldots \cdot C^3 + O(C)$. The key idea is to transform the original question into generalized Pell equations $a x^2 - b y^2 = c$ and study their solutions.</description>

      <title>Redefining Euler-Rabinowitsch Polynomials with Heegner Number Based Quadratic Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of prime-generating quadratic polynomials defined by $f_{Z,k,H}(n) = n^2 - (2Zk - 1)n + \frac{(2Zk - 1)^2 + H}{4}$, where $Zk \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ and $H$ belongs to the set of Heegner numbers. This form is closely related to the Euler-Rabinowitsch polynomials through specific substitutions. The structure enables algebraic tuning for prime-rich outputs and provides deeper insight into the impact of Heegner numbers on prime distribution. Using tools such as the Bateman-Horn conjecture and prime-counting functions, we demonstrate that this family can be optimized to generate a high density of primes. This work offers new directions for research in analytic number theory and potential applications in cryptography and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Explicit Hecke eigenform product identities for Hilbert modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a totally real number field, and $g,f,h$ be Hilbert modular forms over $F$ that are Hecke eigenforms satisfying $g=f\cdot h$. We characterize such product identities among all real quadratic fields of narrow class number one, proving they occur only for $F=\mathbb Q(\sqrt{5})$, with precisely two such identities. We also shed some light on the general totally real case by showing that no such identity exists when both $f$ and $h$ are Eisenstein series of distinct weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fix a prime p and construct new cases of pro-p extensions of number fields with restricted ramification and splitting, whose Galois groups decompose as coproducts of pro-p absolute Galois groups of local fields. As a consequence, these pro-p extensions satisfy the strong Massey vanishing property and thus admit large unipotent quotients.</description>

      <title>Iterates of post-critically finite polynomials of the form $\boldsymbol{x^d+c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a prime number $d$. The post-critically finite polynomials of the form $f_{d,c} = x^d+c\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ play a fundamental role in polynomial dynamics. While many results are known in the complex dynamical setting, much less is understood about the arithmetic properties of these polynomials. In this paper, we describe the factorization of the iterates of post-critically finite polynomials $f_{d,c}$ over their fields of definition. As a consequence, we prove new cases of a conjecture of Andrews and Petsche on abelian arboreal Galois representations.</description>

      <title>A dimensional mass transference principle from balls to open sets and applications to dynamical Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani is a powerful mechanism for determining the Hausdorff dimension/measure of $\limsup$ sets that arise naturally in Diophantine approximation. However, in the setting of dynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply effectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\limsup$ sets generally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself.
  In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that enables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target problems, particularly for the $\beta$-transformation and the Gauss map. Moreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\limsup$ sets have large intersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is that, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding an appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between thermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.</description>

      <title>Isogeny graphs of abelian varieties and singular ideals in orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Famously, Kohel proved that isogeny graphs of ordinary elliptic curves are beautifully structured objects, now called volcanos. We prove graph structural theorems for abelian varieties of any dimension with commutative endomorphism ring and containing a fixed locally Bass order, leveraging an ideal-theoretic perspective on isogeny graphs. This generalizes previous results, which relied on restrictive additional assumptions, such as maximal real multiplication, ordinary, and absolutely simple (Brooks, Jetchev, Wesolowski 2017). In particular, our work also applies to non-simple and non-ordinary isogeny classes. To obtain our results, we first prove a structure theorem for the lattice of inclusion of the overorders of a locally Bass order in an \'etale algebra which is of independent interest. This analysis builds on a careful study of local singularities of the orders. We include several examples of volcanoes and isogeny graphs exhibiting unexpected properties ultimately due to our more general setting.</description>

      <title>Notes and computations on forbidden differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore from several perspectives the following question: given $X\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ and $N\in \mathbb{N}$, what is the maximum size $D(X,N)$ of $A\subseteq \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ before $A$ is forced to contain two distinct elements that differ by an element of $X$? The set of forbidden differences, $X$, is called \textit{intersective} if $D(X,N)=o(N)$, with the most well-studied examples being $X=S=\{n^2: n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $X=\mathcal{P}-1=\{p-1: p\text{ prime}\}$. In addition to some new results, including exact formulas and estimates for $D(X,N)$ in some non-intersective cases like $X=\mathcal{P}$ and $X=S+k$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we also provide a comprehensive survey of known bounds and extensive computational data. In particular, we utilize an existing algorithm for finding maximum cliques in graphs to determine $D(S,N)$ for $N\leq 300$ and $D(\mathcal{P}-1,N)$ for $N\leq 500$. None of these exact values appear previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>Towards Motivic Coactions at Genus One from Zeta Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motivic coaction of multiple zeta values and multiple polylogarithms encodes both structural insights on and computational methods for scattering amplitudes in a variety of quantum field theories and in string theory. In this work, we propose coaction formulae for iterated integrals over holomorphic Eisenstein series that arise from configuration-space integrals at genus one. Our proposal is motivated by formal similarities between the motivic coaction and the single-valued map of multiple polylogarithms at genus zero that are exposed in their recent reformulations via zeta generators. The genus-one coaction of this work is then proposed by analogies with the construction of single-valued iterated Eisenstein integrals via zeta generators at genus one. We show that our proposal exhibits the expected properties of a coaction and deduce $f$-alphabet decompositions of the multiple modular values obtained from regularized limits.</description>

      <title>Quadratic relations for ninth variations of Schur functions and application to Schur multiple zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macdonald's ninth variation of Schur functions is a broad generalization of the classical Schur function and its variants, defined via the Jacobi-Trudi determinant formula. In this paper, we establish various algebraic relations for $S^{(r)}_{\lambda/\mu}(X)$, a class of the ninth variation introduced by Nakagawa, Noumi, Shirakawa, and Yamada, by combining the Jacobi-Trudi formula with determinant formulas such as the Desnanot-Jacobi adjoint matrix theorem and the Pl\"ucker relations, which generalize the corresponding relations for Schur functions. As an application, we investigate algebraic relations for "diagonally constant" Schur multiple zeta functions and examine their specific special values when the shape is rectangular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a given positive odd integer and $p$ an odd prime. In this paper, we shall give a sufficient condition when a prime $p$ divides the order of the groups $K_{2k}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_m+\zeta_m^{-1}])$ and $K_{2k}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_m])$, where $\zeta_m$ is a primitive $m$th root of unity. When $F$ is a $p$-extension contained in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_l)$ for some prime $l$, we also establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the order of $K_{2(p-2)}(\mathcal{O}_F)$ to be divisible by $p$.</description>

      <title>Derived Hecke action on the trivial cohomology of division algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article generalizes Venkatesh's structure theorem for the derived Hecke action on the Hecke trivial cohomology of a division algebra over an imaginary quadratic field to division algebras over all number fields. In particular, we show that the stable submodule of the Hecke trivial cohomology attached to a division algebra is a free module generated by the unit class for the action of the strict derived Hecke algebra. Moreover, the strict derived Hecke algebra possesses a rational form that preserves the canonical rational structure on the stable cohomology during the derived Hecke action. The main ingredients in our improvement are a careful study of the congruence classes in the torsion cohomology of the arithmetic manifold and the author's new result on the reduction map in the $K$-theory of the ring of integers in number fields.</description>

      <title>On the greatest prime factor of polynomial values and subexponential Szpiro in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining a modular approach to the $abc$ conjecture developed by the second author with the classical method of linear forms in logarithms, we obtain improved unconditional bounds for two classical problems. First, for Szpiro's conjecture when the relevant elliptic curves are members of a one-parameter family (an elliptic surface). And secondly, for the problem of giving lower bounds for the greatest prime factor of polynomial values, in the case of quadratic and cubic polynomials. The latter extends earlier work by the second author for the polynomial $n^2+1$.</description>

      <title>Hecke reciprocity and class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ in the family of cubic fields $F = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$. Specifically, as $F$ varies over the subfamily of wildly (resp. tamely) ramified fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$, the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ is $3/2$ (resp. $2$). This tame/wild dichotomy is not accounted for by the class group heuristics in the literature. Analogously, when the extensions $F = K(\sqrt[3]{n})$ of $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ are ordered by the norm of $n \in \mathcal{O}_K$, we show that the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ is $3/2$, as is predicted by the Cohen--Martinet heuristics for $C_3$-extensions of $K$.
  Underlying our proofs is a reciprocity law for the relative class groups $\mathrm{Cl}_{F/K}[2]$ of odd degree extensions of number fields $F/K$. This leads us to propose class group heuristics for families of $K$-extensions with a fixed Galois $K$-group that explains the aberrant behavior in the family $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$ and predicts similar behavior in other special families. The other main ingredient is the work of Alp\"oge--Bhargava--Shnidman on the number of integral $G(\mathbb{Q})$-orbits in a $G$-invariant quadric with bounded invariants.</description>

      <title>Some new congruences on biregular overpartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Nadji, Ahmia and Ram\'{i}rez \cite{Nadji2025} investigate the arithmetic properties of ${\bar B}_{\ell_1,\ell_2}(n)$, the number of overpartitions where no part is divisible by $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ with $\gcd(\ell_1,\ell_2)$$=1$ and $\ell_1$,$\ell_2$$&gt;1$. Specifically, they established congruences modulo $3$ and powers of $2$ for the pairs of $(\ell_1,\ell_2)$$\in$$\{(4,3),(4,9),(8,3),(8,9)\}$, using the concept of generating functions, dissection formulas and Smoot's implementation of Radu's Ramanujan-Kolberg algorithm. After that, Alanazi, Munagi and Saikia \cite{Alanazi2024} studied and found some congruences for the pairs of
  $(\ell_1,\ell_2)\in\{(2,3),(4,3),(2,5),(3,5),(4,9),(8,27),\\(16,81)\} $ using the theory of modular forms and Radu's algorithm. Recently Paudel, Sellers and Wang \cite{Paudel2025} extended several of their results and established infinitely many families of new congruences. In this paper, we find infinitely many families of congruences modulo $3$ and powers of $2$ for the pairs $(\ell_1,\ell_2)$ $ \in$ $\{(2,9),(5,2),(5,4),(8,3)\}$ and in general for $ (5,2^t)$ $\forall t\geq3$ and for $ (3,2^t)$,$ (4,3^t)$ $\forall t\geq2$,
  using the theory of Hecke eigenform, an identity due to Newman and the concept of dissection formulas and generating functions.</description>

      <title>Rationality problem for norm one tori for $A_5$ and ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_8)$ extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16187v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complete answer to the rationality problem (up to stable $k$-equivalence) for norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ of $K/k$ whose Galois closures $L/k$ are $A_5\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_4)$ and ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_8)$ extensions. In particular, we prove that $T$ is stably $k$-rational for $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{8})$, $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\simeq (C_2)^3$ and $H\simeq (C_2)^3\rtimes C_7$ where $C_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$ by using GAP computations with the aid of PARI/GP. Based on the result, we conjecture that $T$ is stably $k$-rational for $G\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{2^d})$, $(C_2)^d\leq H\leq (C_2)^d\rtimes C_{2^d-1}$. Some other cases $G\simeq A_n$, $S_n$, ${\rm GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm PGL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm PSL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$ and $H\lneq G$ are also investigated for small $n$ and $p^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his paper on the Mordell-Lang conjecture, Hrushovski employed techniques from model theory to prove the function field version of the conjecture. In doing so he was able to answer a related question of Voloch, which we refer to henceforth as Hrushovski's theorem. In this paper we shall give an alternative proof of said theorem in the characteristic $p$ setting, but using purely algebro-geometric ideas.</description>

      <title>Modular Features of Superstring Scattering Amplitudes: Generalised Eisenstein Series and Theta Lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous papers it has been shown that the coefficients of terms in the large-$N$ expansion of a certain integrated four-point correlator of superconformal primary operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are rational sums of real-analytic Eisenstein series and "generalised Eisenstein series''. The latter are novel modular functions first encountered in the context of graviton amplitudes in type IIB superstring theory. Similar modular functions, known as two-loop modular graph functions, are also encountered in the low-energy expansion of the integrand of genus-one closed superstring amplitudes. In this paper we further develop the mathematical structure of such generalised Eisenstein series emphasising, in particular, the occurrence of $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms in their Fourier mode decomposition. We show that both the coefficients in the large-$N$ expansion of the integrated correlator and two-loop modular graph functions admit a unifying description in terms of four-dimensional lattice sums generated by theta lifts of local Maass functions, which generalise the structure of real-analytic Eisenstein series. Through the theta lift representation, we demonstrate that elements belonging to these two families of non-holomorphic modular functions can be expressed as rational linear combinations of generalised Eisenstein series for which all the $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms precisely cancel.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resistant RSA Modulus Decomposition via Adaptive R\'enyi Entropy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a theoretical approach to enhance RSA's resistance against quantum attacks by optimizing prime selection through R\'enyi entropy constraints. We develop a framework where primes are generated with controlled proximity ($|p-q| &lt; \gamma\sqrt{pq}$) to minimize the collision entropy $\mathscr{H}_2$ of the quantum period-finding operator.
  The main contributions include: (1) establishing a connection between prime distribution properties and quantum attack complexity via Maynard's prime gap theorem, (2) providing a constructive proof for prime existence under entropy constraints, and (3) demonstrating security reduction to ideal lattice problems under the quantum random oracle model.
  Theoretical analysis suggests that for $k$-bit moduli with $\gamma &lt; k^{-1/2+\epsilon}$, Shor's algorithm requires $\Omega(\gamma^{-1}k^{3/2})$ quantum operations while maintaining classical security equivalent to standard RSA. Key Enhancements: (1) Prime existence proof via Maynard's theorem (Theorem 3.1), (2) Ideal lattice embedding for SVP reduction (Theorem 5.3), (3) Quantum Fano bound for information-theoretic analysis (Theorem 6.3), (4) Multi-prime RSA extension (Section 7.3).</description>
