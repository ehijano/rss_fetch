      <title>Strict renormalizability as a paradigm for fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important theoretical achievement of the last century was the realization that strict renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians in the framework of perturbative quantum field theory. The Standard Model Lagrangian (without gravity) is strictly renormalizable from a perturbative point of view. On the other hand, the inclusion of gravity seems not to respect this criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable. The aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict renormalizability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity. First, we show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory known as quadratic gravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the most conservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly predictive, as it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in the sub-Planckian regime. In particular, it provides one of the best fits to the CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation and makes sharp cosmological predictions that can be tested in the near future. Finally, we comment on the (super-)Planckian regime and conclude with a historical note.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Hilbert's Sixth Problem: Derivation of Fluid Equations via Boltzmann's Kinetic Theory" by Deng, Hani, and Ma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deng, Hani, and Ma [arXiv:2503.01800] claim to resolve Hilbert's Sixth Problem by deriving the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations from Newtonian mechanics via an iterated limit: a Boltzmann-Grad limit (\(\varepsilon \to 0\), \(N \varepsilon^{d-1} = \alpha\) fixed) yielding the Boltzmann equation, followed by a hydrodynamic limit (\(\alpha \to \infty\)) to obtain fluid dynamics. Though mathematically rigorous, their approach harbors two critical physical flaws. First, the vanishing volume fraction (\(N \varepsilon^d \to 0\)) confines the system to a dilute gas, incapable of embodying dense fluid properties even as \(\alpha\) scales, rendering the resulting equations a rescaled gas model rather than a true continuum. Second, the Boltzmann equation's reliance on molecular chaos collapses in fluid-like regimes, where recollisions and correlations invalidate its derivation from Newtonian dynamics. These inconsistencies expose a disconnect between the formalism and the physical essence of fluids, failing to capture emergent, density-driven phenomena central to Hilbert's vision. We contend that the Sixth Problem remains open, urging a rethink of classical kinetic theory's limits and the exploration of alternative frameworks to unify microscale mechanics with macroscale fluid behavior.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Dark Energy Prior to its Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a review and statistical analysis of the evidence supporting the existence of a cosmological constant in the early 1990s, before its discovery made with distant supernovae in 1998. The earlier evidence was derived from newly precise measurements of the Universe, including its mass density, the Hubble constant, the age of the oldest stars, the filamentary large-scale structure, and the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. These measurements created tension for models assuming the cosmological constant was zero. This tension was alleviated by several insightful papers published before 1996, which proposed a cosmological constant that increased the expansion rate. Statistical analysis here shows that the probability of the cosmological constant being zero was demonstrably less than a few percent. Some models identified a best-fit value close to the modern estimate of Omega_Lambda ~ 0.7.</description>
