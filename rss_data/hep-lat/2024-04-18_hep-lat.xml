      <title>Multiscale Normalizing Flows for Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale separation is an important physical principle that has previously enabled algorithmic advances such as multigrid solvers. Previous work on normalizing flows has been able to utilize scale separation in the context of scalar field theories, but the principle has been largely unexploited in the context of gauge theories. This work gives an overview of a new method for generating gauge fields using hierarchical normalizing flow models. This method builds gauge fields from the outside in, allowing different parts of the model to focus on different scales of the problem. Numerical results are presented for $U(1)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge theories in 2, 3, and 4 spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Extraction of nonperturbative parameters for $D^{(*)}$ mesons from lattice data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent data for the masses of $D$ and $D^*$ mesons determined using methods of lattice QCD for several values of the charm quark mass different from its physical mass are analysed in Heavy Quark Effective Theory. Nonperturbative parameters are extracted that arise at order ${\cal O}(1/m_c)$ in the heavy-quark mass expansion of a heavy-light meson mass. The determined parameters are used to establish the charm quark masses corresponding to the employed lattice sets.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle Flux Tube S-matrix Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of branon jets, states of collinear flux tube excitations. We argue for the analyticity, crossing and unitarity of the multi-particle scattering of these jets and, through the S-matrix bootstrap, place bounds on a set of finite energy multi-particle sum rules. Such bounds define a matrioska of sorts with a smaller and smaller allowed regions as we impose more constraints. The Yang-Mills flux tube, as well as other interesting flux tube theories recently studied through lattice simulations, lie inside a tiny island hundreds of times smaller than the most general space of allowed two-dimensional theories.</description>

      <title>Predicting isovector charmonium-like states from X(3872) properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using chiral effective field theory, we predict that there must be isovector charmonium-like $D\bar D^*$ hadronic molecules with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ denoted as $W_{c1}$. The inputs are the properties of the $X(3872)$, including its mass and the ratio of its branching fractions of decays into $J/\psi\rho^0$ and $J/\psi\omega$. The predicted states are virtual state poles of the scattering matrix, pointing at a molecular nature of the $X(3872)$ as well as its spin partners. They should show up as either a mild cusp or dip at the $D\bar D^*$ thresholds, explaining why they are elusive in experiments. The so far negative observation also indicates that the $X(3872)$ is either a bound state with non-vanishing binding energy or a virtual state, only in these cases the $X(3872)$ signal dominates over that from the $W_{c1}^0$. The pole positions are $3865.3^{+4.2}_{-7.4}- i 0.15^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ MeV for $W_{c1}^0$ and $3866.9^{+4.6}_{-7.7}- i (0.07\pm0.01)$ MeV for $W_{c1}^\pm$. The findings imply that the peak in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass distribution is not purely from the $X(3872)$ but contains contributions from $W_{c1}^0$ predicted here. The states should have isovector heavy quark spin partners with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ and $1^{+-}$, with the last one corresponding to $Z_c$. We suggest to search for the charged $0^{++}$, $1^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ states in $J/\psi\pi^\pm \pi^0$.</description>

      <title>Masses of the conjectured H-dibaryon at different temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10258v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD determination of masses of the conjectured H-dibaryon $m_H$ at nine different temperatures $T/T_c =0.24, 0.63, 0.76, 0.84, 0.95, 1.09, 1.27, 1.52, 1.90$. In the meantime, the masses of baryon $N$, $\Sigma$, $\Xi$ and $\Lambda$ at different temperatures are also computed.
  The simulation is performed on anisotropic lattice with $N_f=2+1$ flavours of clover fermion at quark mass which corresponds to $m_\pi=384(4) {\rm MeV} $. The thermal ensembles were provided by the FASTSUM collaboration and the zero temperature ensembles by the Hadspec collaboration. We also calculate the spectral density of the correlation function of those particles.
  The spectral density distributions show rich peak structure at the lowest temperature, while at intermediate temperatures, the mass values of those particles obtained by extrapolation method reflect a two-peak structure.
  While the spectral density for octet baryon becomes smooth at $T/T_c = 1.27, 1.52, 1.90$, the spectral density for H-dibaryon becoms smooth at $T/T_c = 1.90$.
  At $T/T_c =0.24 $, the mass difference of H-dibaryon and
$\Lambda$ pair $\Delta m = m_H - 2\,m_{\Lambda} $ is estimated to be $\Delta m = -14.6(6.2) {\rm MeV}$ which suggests there exists a bound H-dibaryon state.</description>

      <title>Real-time scattering in the lattice Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor network methods have demonstrated their suitability for the study of equilibrium properties of lattice gauge theories, even close to the continuum limit. We use them in an out-of-equilibrium scenario, much less explored so far, by simulating the real-time collisions of composite mesons in the lattice Schwinger model. Constructing wave-packets of vector mesons at different incoming momenta, we observe the opening of the inelastic channel in which two heavier mesons are produced and identify the momentum threshold. To detect the products of the collision in the strong coupling regime we propose local quantitites that could be measured in current quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Bound State Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last few years have seen rapid development of applications of quantum computation to quantum field theory. The first algorithms for quantum simulation of scattering have been proposed in the context of scalar and fermionic theories, requiring thousands of logical qubits. These algorithms are not suitable to simulate scattering of incoming bound states, as the initial-state preparation relies typically on adiabatically transforming wavepackets of the free theory into wavepackets of the interacting theory. In this paper we present a strategy to excite wavepackets of the interacting theory directly from the vacuum of the interacting theory, allowing the preparation of states of composite particles. This is the first step towards digital quantum simulation of scattering of bound states. The approach is based on the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, which provides a way to construct creation and annihilation operators of a theory in a full, nonperturbative framework. We provide a quantum algorithm requiring a number of ancillary qubits that is logarithmic in the size of the wavepackets, and with a success probability vanishing at most like a polynomial in the lattice parameters and the energy of the wavepacket. The gate complexity for a single iteration of the circuit is equivalent to that of a time evolution for a fixed time. Furthermore, we propose a complete protocol for scattering simulation using this algorithm. We study its efficiency and find improvements with respect to previous algorithms in the literature.</description>
