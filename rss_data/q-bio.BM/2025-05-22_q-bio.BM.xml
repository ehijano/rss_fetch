      <title>Selective profiling of non-canonical nucleic acid structures via size-discriminative supramolecular probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleic acids can form diverse non-canonical structures, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s) and i-motifs (iMs), which are critical in biological processes and disease pathways. This study presents an innovative probe design strategy based on groove size differences, leading to the development of BT-Cy-1, a supramolecular cyanine probe optimized by fine-tuning dimer "thickness". BT-Cy-1 demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting structural transitions and variations in G4s and iMs, even in complex environments with excess dsDNA. Applied to clinical blood samples, it revealed significant differences in RNA G4 and iM levels between liver cancer patients and healthy individuals, marking the first report of altered iM levels in clinical samples. This work highlights a novel approach for precise nucleic acid structural profiling, offering insights into their biological significance and potential in disease diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Steering Generative Models with Experimental Data for Protein Fitness Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein fitness optimization involves finding a protein sequence that maximizes desired quantitative properties in a combinatorially large design space of possible sequences. Recent developments in steering protein generative models (e.g diffusion models, language models) offer a promising approach. However, by and large, past studies have optimized surrogate rewards and/or utilized large amounts of labeled data for steering, making it unclear how well existing methods perform and compare to each other in real-world optimization campaigns where fitness is measured by low-throughput wet-lab assays. In this study, we explore fitness optimization using small amounts (hundreds) of labeled sequence-fitness pairs and comprehensively evaluate strategies such as classifier guidance and posterior sampling for guiding generation from different discrete diffusion models of protein sequences. We also demonstrate how guidance can be integrated into adaptive sequence selection akin to Thompson sampling in Bayesian optimization, showing that plug-and-play guidance strategies offer advantages compared to alternatives such as reinforcement learning with protein language models.</description>

      <title>MolLangBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Language-Prompted Molecular Structure Recognition, Editing, and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks. We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality, unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations: the strongest model (o3) achieves $79.2\%$ and $78.5\%$ accuracy on recognition and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even worse on the generation task, reaching only $29.0\%$ accuracy. These results highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for chemical applications.</description>

Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as promising nanomaterials with unique optical and physical properties, making them highly attractive for various applications in biomedicine. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the types, modes of synthesis, characterization, applications, and recent advances of QDs in the field of biomedicine, with a primary focus on bioimaging, drug delivery, and biosensors. The unique properties of QDs, such as tunable emission spectra, long-term photostability, high quantum yield, and targeted drug delivery, hold tremendous promise for advancing diagnostics, therapeutics, and imaging techniques in biomedical research. However, several significant hurdles remain before their full potential in the biomedical field, like bioaccumulation, toxicity, and short-term stability. Addressing these hurdles is essential to effectively incorporate QDs into clinical use and enhance their influence on healthcare outcomes. Furthermore, the review conducts a critical analysis of potential QD toxicity and explores recent progress in strategies and methods to mitigate these adverse effects, such as surface modification, surface coatings, and encapsulation. By thoroughly examining current research and recent advancements, this comprehensive review offers invaluable insights into both the future possibilities and the challenges that lie ahead in fully harnessing the potential of QDs in the field of biomedicine, promising a revolution in the landscape of medical diagnostics, therapies, and imaging technologies.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Benchmark for RNA 3D Structure-Function Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between RNA structure and function has recently attracted interest within the deep learning community, a trend expected to intensify as nucleic acid structure models advance. Despite this momentum, a lack of standardized, accessible benchmarks for applying deep learning to RNA 3D structures hinders progress. To this end, we introduce a collection of seven benchmarking datasets specifically designed to support RNA structure-function prediction. Built on top of the established Python package rnaglib, our library streamlines data distribution and encoding, provides tools for dataset splitting and evaluation, and offers a comprehensive, user-friendly environment for model comparison. The modular and reproducible design of our datasets encourages community contributions and enables rapid customization. To demonstrate the utility of our benchmarks, we report baseline results for all tasks using a relational graph neural network.</description>

      <title>AI-guided Antibiotic Discovery Pipeline from Target Selection to Compound Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antibiotic resistance presents a growing global health crisis, demanding new therapeutic strategies that target novel bacterial mechanisms. Recent advances in protein structure prediction and machine learning-driven molecule generation offer a promising opportunity to accelerate drug discovery. However, practical guidance on selecting and integrating these models into real-world pipelines remains limited. In this study, we develop an end-to-end, artificial intelligence-guided antibiotic discovery pipeline that spans target identification to compound realization. We leverage structure-based clustering across predicted proteomes of multiple pathogens to identify conserved, essential, and non-human-homologous targets. We then systematically evaluate six leading 3D-structure-aware generative models$\unicode{x2014}$spanning diffusion, autoregressive, graph neural network, and language model architectures$\unicode{x2014}$on their usability, chemical validity, and biological relevance. Rigorous post-processing filters and commercial analogue searches reduce over 100 000 generated compounds to a focused, synthesizable set. Our results highlight DeepBlock and TamGen as top performers across diverse criteria, while also revealing critical trade-offs between model complexity, usability, and output quality. This work provides a comparative benchmark and blueprint for deploying artificial intelligence in early-stage antibiotic development.</description>

      <title>Interactive visualization of large molecular systems with VTX: example with a minimal whole-cell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: VTX is an open-source molecular visualization software designed to overcome the scaling limitations of existing real-time molecular visualization software when handling massive molecular datasets. VTX employs a meshless molecular graphics engine utilizing impostor-based techniques and adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) rendering. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and enables real-time visualization and manipulation of large molecular systems. Performance benchmarks against VMD, PyMOL, and ChimeraX using a 114-million-bead Martini minimal whole-cell model demonstrate VTX's efficiency, maintaining consistent frame rates even under interactive manipulation on standard computer hardware. VTX incorporates features such as screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) for enhanced depth perception and free-fly navigation for intuitive exploration of large molecular systems. VTX is open-source and free for non commercial use. Binaries for Windows and Ubuntu Linux are available at http://vtx.drugdesign.fr. VTX source code is available at https://github.com/VTX-Molecular-Visualization.</description>
