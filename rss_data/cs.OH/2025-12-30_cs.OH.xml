      <title>S-BLE: A Participatory BLE Sensory Data Set Recorded from Real-World Bus Travel Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution describes S-BLE, a data set created for supporting the design of robust and reliable Be-In-Be-Out systems in public transit. S-BLE was recorded by the smartphones of 28 participants during their daily transit routines in a university campus setting. 20 shuttle bus vehicles in the campus fleet were equipped with two Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons each. RSSI data from these beacons was recorded during regular rides, along with odometry information (from GPS) and data from the smartphone's inertial sensors. The article describes the system used for data collection and presents some statistics of interest for the recorded data.</description>
