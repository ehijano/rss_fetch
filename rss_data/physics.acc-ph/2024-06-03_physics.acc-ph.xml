      <title>Final Physics Design of Proton Improvement Plan-II At Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the final physics design of the Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) at Fermilab, focusing on the linear accelerator (Linac) and its beam transfer line. We address the challenges in longitudinal and transverse lattice design, specifically targeting collective effects, parametric resonances, and space charge nonlinearities that impact beam stability and emittance control. The strategies implemented effectively mitigate space charge complexities, resulting in significant improvements in beam quality -- evidenced by reduced emittance growth, lower beam halo, decreased loss, and better energy spread management. This comprehensive study is pivotal for the PIP-II project's success, providing valuable insights and approaches for future accelerator designs, especially in managing nonlinearities and enhancing beam dynamics.</description>

      <title>Full-Cycle Simulations of the Fermilab Booster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Proton Improvement Plan phase II (PIP-II) project currently under construction at FNAL will replace the existing 400 MeV normal conducting linac with a new 800 MeV superconducting linac. The beam power in the downstream rapid-cycling Booster synchrotron will be doubled by raising the machine cycle frequency from 15 to 20 Hz and by increasing the injected beam intensity by a factor 1.5. This has to be accomplished without raising uncontrolled losses beyond the administrative limit of 500 W. In addition, slip-stacking efficiency in the Recycler, the next machine in the accelerator chain, sets an upper limit on the longitudinal emittance of the beam delivered by the Booster. As part of an effort to better understand potential losses and emittance blow-up in the Booster, we have been conducting full cycle 6D simulations using the code PyORBIT. The simulations include space charge, wall impedance effects and transition crossing. In this paper, we discuss our experience with the code and present representative results for possible operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Proton beam dynamics in bare IOTA with intense space-charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are commissioning a 2.5-MeV proton beam for the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator at Fermilab, allowing experiments in the strong space-charge regime with incoherent betatron tune shifts nearing 0.5. Accurate modelling of space-charge dynamics is vital for understanding planned experiments. We compare anticipated emittance growth and beam loss in the bare IOTA configuration using transverse space-charge models in Xsuite, PyORBIT, and MADX simulation codes. Our findings reveal agreement within a factor of 2 in core phase-space density predictions up to 100 synchrotron periods at moderate beam currents, while tail distributions and beam loss show significant differences.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Simulations of Thermal Shock Testing of Nanofibrous High Power Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increase of primary beam power for neutrino beam-lines leads to a reduced lifespan for production targets. New concepts for robust targets are emerging from the field of High Power Targetry (HPT); one idea being investigated by the HPT R&amp;D Group at Fermilab is an electrospun nanofiber target. As part of their evaluation, samples with different densities were sent to the HiRadMat facility at CERN for thermal shock tests. The samples with the higher density, irradiated under a high intensity beam pulse, exhibit major damage at the impact site whereas those with the lower density show no apparent damage. The exact cause of this failure was unclear at the time. In this paper, we present the results of multiphysics simulations of the thermal shock experienced by the nanofiber targets that suggest the failure originates from the reduced permeability of the high density sample to air flow. The air present in the porous target expands due to heating from the beam, but is unable to flow freely in the high density sample, resulting in a larger back pressure that blows apart the nanofiber mat. We close with a discussion on how to further validate this hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Space charge dominated momentum spread and compensation strategies in the post-linac section of Proton Improvement Plan-II at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II), designated for enhancements to the Fermilab accelerator complex, features a new 800 MeV superconducting linac and a Beam Transfer Line (BTL) to transport the beam to the existing Booster synchrotron. To mitigate the space charge tune shift associated with a high intensity accumulated beam, the low emittance linac beam is used to paint the ring phase space both transversely and longitudinally. To prevent losses caused by particles injected outside the rf separatrix while painting longitudinal phase space, the momentum spread of the incoming beam should not exceed 2.1 x 10^-4. Detailed simulations showed that due to space charge, the rms momentum spread increases to 4 x 10^-4 while it is transported in the BTL --about twice the allowable limit. In this paper, we outline a mitigation strategy involving a debuncher cavity. We discuss location, operating frequency, and gap voltage under both nominal and perturbed beam conditions, specifically accounting for momentum jitter. The impact of cavity misalignments is also assessed. The paper concludes by recommending an optimized configuration.</description>
