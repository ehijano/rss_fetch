      <title>Intelligent Soft Matter: Towards Embodied Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent soft matter stands at the intersection of materials science, physics, and cognitive science, promising to change how we design and interact with materials. This transformative field seeks to create materials that possess life-like capabilities, such as perception, learning, memory, and adaptive behavior. Unlike traditional materials, which typically perform static or predefined functions, intelligent soft matter dynamically interacts with its environment. It integrates multiple sensory inputs, retains experiences, and makes decisions to optimize its responses. Inspired by biological systems, these materials intend to leverage the inherent properties of soft matter: flexibility, self-evolving, and responsiveness to perform functions that mimic cognitive processes. By synthesizing current research trends and projecting their evolution, we present a forward-looking perspective on how intelligent soft matter could be constructed, with the aim of inspiring innovations in fields such as biomedical devices, adaptive robotics, and beyond. We highlight new pathways for integrating design of sensing, memory and action with internal low-power operations and discuss challenges for practical implementation of materials with "intelligent behavior". These approaches outline a path towards to more robust, versatile and scalable materials that can potentially act, compute, and "think" by their inherent intrinsic material behaviour beyond traditional smart technologies relying on external control.</description>

      <title>Desmearing two-dimensional small-angle neutron scattering data by central moment expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolution smearing is a critical challenge in the quantitative analysis of two-dimensional small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data, particularly in studies of soft matter flow and deformation using SANS. We present the central moment expansion technique to address smearing in anisotropic scattering spectra, offering a model-free desmearing methodology. By accounting for directional variations in resolution smearing and enhancing computational efficiency, this approach reconstructs desmeared intensity distributions from smeared experimental data. Computational benchmarks using interacting hard-sphere fluids and Gaussian chain models validate the accuracy of the method, while simulated noise analyses confirm its robustness under experimental conditions. Furthermore, experimental validation using the rheo-SANS data of shear-induced micellar structures demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The desmearing technique provides a powerful tool for advancing the quantitative analysis of anisotropic scattering patterns, enabling precise insights into the interplay between material microstructure and macroscopic flow behavior.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Transients in Motility-Induced Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate normal diffusion in a two-dimensional athermal suspension of active particles undergoing motility-induced phase separation. The particles are modeled as achiral Janus disks with fixed self-propulsion speed and weakly fluctuating orientation. When plotted versus the overall suspension packing fraction, the relevant diffusion constant traces a hysteresis loop with sharp jumps in correspondence with the binodal and spinodal of the gaseous phase. No hysteresis loop is observed between the spinodal and binodal of the dense phase, as they appear to overlap. Moreover, even under steady-state phase separation, the particle displacement distributions exhibit non-Gaussian normal diffusion with transient fat (thin) tails in the presence (absence) of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Controlling deposition and characterising dynamics of thin liquid films with high temporal and spatial resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high inertia of classical fluid coating processes severely limits the possibility of controlling the deposited film thickness through the entrainment velocity. We describe and characterize a new experimental device where the inertia is dramatically reduced, allowing for millimeter-scale patterning with micrometer-accurate thickness. Measuring precise film profiles over large spatial extents with high temporal resolution poses a challenge, which we overcome using a custom interferometric set-up coupled with state-of-the-art signal processing. The sensitivity of our method allows us to resolve film thinning rates in the nanometer-per-second range, and to quantify the relative contribution of surface-tension and gravity driven flows. We apply this method by showing that the thickness of the deposited film obeys the classical Landau-Levich scaling even when the meniscus faces important acceleration.</description>

      <title>Impact of friction and grain shape on the morphology of sheared granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between dilatancy and particle alignment in sheared granular materials composed of non-spherical particles leads to morphological inhomogeneity. Dilatancy, driven by interparticle friction, causes the packing to expand, while particle alignment tends to densify it. We examine the influence of friction, particle aspect ratio, and initial packing conditions on the steady-state particle alignment and packing density. Unlike spherical particles, non-spherical particles with higher AR exhibit either dilatancy or compaction under shear, leading to spontaneous heaping or depression formation. We analyzed the evolution of packing density to identify whether dilatancy or compression prevails within the shear band.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench. Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Quorum sensing and absorbing phase transitions in colloidal active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike biological active matter that constantly adapt to their environment, the motors of synthetic active particles are typically agnostic to their surroundings and merely operate at constant force. Here, we design colloidal active rods capable of modulating their inner activity in response to crowding, thereby enforcing a primitive form of quorum sensing interactions. Through experiments, simulations and theory we elucidate the impact of these interactions on the phase behavior of isotropic active matter. We demonstrate that, when conditioned to density, motility regulation can either lead to an absorbing phase transition, where all particles freeze their dynamics, or to atypical phase separation, where flat interfaces supporting a net pressure drop are in mechanical equilibrium. Fully active and fully arrested particles can then form heterogeneous patterns ruled by the competition between quorum sensing and mechanical interactions. Beyond the specifics of motile colloids, we expect our findings to apply broadly to adaptive active matter assembled from living or synthetic units.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Free-Energy Functionals with Pair-Correlation Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic Helmholtz free-energy functional, the centerpiece of classical density functional theory, is at best only known approximately for 3D systems. Here we introduce a method for learning a neuralnetwork approximation of this functional by exclusively training on a dataset of radial distribution functions, circumventing the need to sample costly heterogeneous density profiles in a wide variety of external potentials. For a supercritical Lennard-Jones system with planar symmetry, we demonstrate that the learned neural free-energy functional accurately predicts inhomogeneous density profiles under various complex external potentials obtained from simulations.</description>

      <title>Freezing, melting and the onset of glassiness in binary mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify the relationship between freezing, melting, and the onset of glassy dynamics in a prototypical glass-forming mixture model. Our starting point is a precise operational definition of the onset of glassiness, as expressed by the emergence of inflections in time-dependent correlation functions. By scanning the temperature-composition phase diagram of the mixture, we find a disconnect between the onset of glassiness and freezing. Surprisingly, however, the onset temperature closely tracks the melting line, along which the excess entropy is approximately constant. At fixed composition, all characteristic temperatures display nonetheless similar pressure dependencies, which are very well predicted by the isomorph theory. While our results rule out a general connection between thermodynamic metastability and glassiness, they call for a reassessment of the role of crystalline precursors in glass-forming liquids.</description>

      <title>Rheological regimes in agitated granular media under shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agitated granular media have a rich rheology: they exhibit Newtonian behavior at low shear rate and density, develop a yield stress at high density, and cross over to Bagnoldian shear thickening when sheared rapidly -- making them challenging to encompass in one theoretical framework. We measure the rheology of air-fluidized glass particles, spanning five orders of magnitude in shear rate. By comparing fluidization-induced to Brownian agitation, we show that all rheological regimes can be delineated by two dimensionless numbers -- the Peclet number, $\Pe$, and the ratio of shear-to-fluidization power, $\Pi$ -- and propose a constitutive relation that captures all flow behaviors, qualitatively and quantitatively, in one unified framework.</description>
