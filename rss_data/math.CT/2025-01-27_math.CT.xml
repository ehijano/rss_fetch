      <title>The Funayama envelope as the $T_D$-hull of a frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce proximity morphisms between MT-algebras and show that the resulting category is equivalent to the category of frames. This is done by utilizing the Funayama envelope of a frame, which is viewed as the $T_D$-hull. Our results have some spatial ramifications, including a generalization of the $T_D$-duality of Banaschewski and Pultr.</description>

      <title>Duplicial functors, descent categories and generalized Hopf modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: B\"ohm and \c{S}tefan have expressed cyclic homology as an invariant that assigns homology groups $\mathrm{HC}^\chi_i(\mathrm N, \mathrm M)$ to right and left coalgebras $\mathrm N$ respectively $\mathrm M$ over a distributive law $\chi$ between two comonads. For the key example associated to a bialgebra $H$, right $\chi$-coalgebras have a description in terms of modules and comodules over $H$. The present article formulates conditions under which such a description is simultaneously possible for the left $\chi$-coalgebras. In the above example, this is the case when the bialgebra $H$ is a Hopf algebra with bijective antipode. We also discuss how the generalized Hopf module theorem by Mesablishvili and Wisbauer features both in theory and examples.</description>

      <title>Mixed Motives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mixed Weil cohomology with values in an abelian rigid tensor category is a cohomological functor on Voevodsky's category of motives which is satisfying K\"unneth formula and such that its restriction to Chow motives is a Weil cohomology. We show that the universal mixed Weil cohomology exists. Nori motives can be recovered as a universal enrichment of Betti cohomology via a localisation. This new picture is drawing some consequences with respect to the theory of mixed motives in arbitrary characteristic.</description>

      <title>Fra\"iss\'e limit and Ramsey Theorem: the case of MV-algebras and a categorical generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the Fra\"iss\'e limit of finite MV-algebras and then prove that finite MV-algebras verify the Ramsey property. Then we show that MV-algebras are just a special case of a more general situation. In fact, under minumum conditions for the application of the Kechris-Pestov-Todorcevic correspondence, Ramsey property holds for a certain category of finite structures if and only if it holds for a completion subcategory of it.</description>

      <title>Duoidal Structures for Compositional Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a categorical framework for mathematical objects for which there is both a sort of "independent" and "dependent" composition. Namely we model them as duoidal categories in which both monoidal structures share a unit and the first is symmetric. We construct the free such category and observe that it is a full subcategory of the category of finite posets. Indeed each algebraic expression in the two monoidal operators corresponds to the poset built by taking disjoint unions and joins of the singleton poset. We characterize these "expressible" posets as precisely those which contain no "zig-zags." We then move on to describe categories equipped with $n$-ary operations for each $n$-element finite poset; we refer to them as "dependence categories" since they allow for combinations of objects based on any network of dependencies between them.
  These structures model various sorts of dependence including the space-like and time-like juxtaposition of weighted probability distributions in relativistic spacetime, which we model using polynomial endofunctors on the category of sets, as well as the runtimes for multiple computer programs run in parallel and series, which we model using the tropical semiring structure on nonnegative real numbers. With these examples in mind, we conclude by describing ways in which morphisms in a partial monoidal category can be "decorated" in a coherent manner by objects in a dependence category, such as labeling a network of parallel programs with their runtimes.</description>

      <title>Hidden Markov Models and the Bayes Filter in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Markov categories to generalize the basic theory of Markov chains and hidden Markov models to an abstract setting. This comprises characterizations of hidden Markov models in terms of conditional independences and algorithms for Bayesian filtering and smoothing applicable in all Markov categories with conditionals. When instantiated in appropriate Markov categories, these algorithms specialize to existing ones such as the Kalman filter, forward-backward algorithm, and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. We also prove that the sequence of outputs of our abstract Bayes filter is itself a Markov chain with a concrete formula for its transition maps.
  There are two main features of this categorical framework. The first is its abstract generality, as manifested in our unified account of hidden Markov models and algorithms for filtering and smoothing in discrete probability, Gaussian probability, measure-theoretic probability, possibilistic nondeterminism and others at the same time. The second feature is the intuitive visual representation of information flow in terms of string diagrams.</description>
