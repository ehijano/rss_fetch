      <title>SimpliCity: Reconstructing Buildings with Simple Regularized 3D Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic methods for reconstructing buildings from airborne LiDAR point clouds focus on producing accurate 3D models in a fast and scalable manner, but they overlook the problem of delivering simple and regularized models to practitioners. As a result, output meshes often suffer from connectivity approximations around corners with either the presence of multiple vertices and tiny facets, or the necessity to break the planarity constraint on roof sections and facade components. We propose a 2D planimetric arrangement-based framework to address this problem. We first regularize, not the 3D planes as commonly done in the literature, but a 2D polyhedral partition constructed from the planes. Second, we extrude this partition to 3D by an optimization process that guarantees the planarity of the roof sections as well as the preservation of the vertical discontinuities and horizontal rooftop edges. We show the benefits of our approach against existing methods by producing simpler 3D models while offering a similar fidelity and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Interval Decomposition of Persistence Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of persistent homology has contributed new insights and perspectives into a variety of interesting problems in science and engineering. Work in this domain relies on the result that any finitely-indexed persistence module of finite-dimensional vector spaces admits an interval decomposition -- that is, a decomposition as a direct sum of simpler components called interval modules. This result fails if we replace vector spaces with modules over more general coefficient rings.
  We introduce an algorithm to determine whether a persistence module of pointwise free and finitely-generated modules over a principal ideal domain (PID) splits as a direct sum of interval submodules. If one exists, our algorithm outputs an interval decomposition. Our algorithm is finite (respectively, polynomial) time if the problem of computing Smith normal form over the chosen PID is finite (respectively, polynomial) time. This is the first algorithm with these properties of which we are aware.
  We also show that a persistence module of pointwise free and finitely-generated modules over a PID splits as a direct sum of interval submodules if and only if the cokernel of every structure map is free. This result underpins the formulation our algorithm. It also complements prior findings by Obayashi and Yoshiwaki regarding persistent homology, including a criterion for field independence and an algorithm to decompose persistence homology modules of simplex-wise filtrations.</description>
