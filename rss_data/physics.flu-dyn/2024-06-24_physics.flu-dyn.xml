      <title>Modular and Extendable 1D-Simulation for Microfluidic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices have been the subject of considerable attention in recent years. The development of novel microfluidic devices, their evaluation, and their validation requires simulations. While common methods based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be time-consuming, 1D simulation provides an appealing alternative that leads to efficient results with reasonable quality. Current 1D simulation tools cover specific microfluidic applications; however, these tools are still rare and not widely adopted. There is a need for a more versatile and adaptable tool that covers novel applications, like mixing and the addition of membranes, and allows easy extension, resulting in one comprehensive 1D simulation tool for microfluidic devices. In this work, we present an open-source, modular, and extendable 1D simulation approach for microfluidic devices, which is available as an open-source software package at https://github.com/cda-tum/mmft-modular-1D-simulator. To this end, we propose an implementation that consists of a base module (providing the core functionality) that can be extended with dedicated application-specific modules (providing dedicated support for common microfluidic applications such as mixing, droplets, membranes, etc.). Case studies show that this indeed allows to efficiently simulate a broad spectrum of microfluidic applications in a quality that matches previous results or even fabricated devices.</description>

      <title>Stabilising nonlinear travelling waves in pipe flow using time-delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first successful non-invasive stabilisation of nonlinear travelling waves in a straight circular pipe using time-delayed feedback control (TDF). The main novelty in this work is in the application of a "multiple time-delayed feedback" (MTDF) approach, where several control terms are required to attenuate a broad range of unstable eigenfrequencies. We implement a gradient descent method to dynamically adjust the gain functions, $G_i(t),$ in order to reduce the need for tuning a high dimensional parameter space. We consider the effect of the control terms via an approximate linear analysis and a frequency-domain analysis, which justifies the choice of MTDF parameters. By using an adaptive approach to setting the control gains, we advocate for a broad range of MTDF terms which are then free to find their own stabilising amplitudes for a given target solution, thereby removing trial and error when the instability of the target solution is unknown a'priori. This also enables travelling waves to be stabilised from generic turbulent states and with speculative starting parameters.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Aeroelastic Analyses of Structures in Turbulent Wind Conditions using Enhanced Gaussian Processes with Aerodynamic Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in data-driven aeroelasticity have been driven by the wealth of data available in the wind engineering practice, especially in modeling aerodynamic forces. Despite progress, challenges persist in addressing free-stream turbulence and incorporating physics knowledge into data-driven aerodynamic force models. This paper presents a hybrid Gaussian Process (GPs) methodology for non-linear modeling of aerodynamic forces induced by gusts and motion on bluff bodies. Building on a recently developed GP model of the motion-induced forces, we formulate a hybrid GP aerodynamic force model that incorporates both gust- and motion-induced angles of attack as exogenous inputs, alongside a semi-analytical quasi-steady (QS) model as a physics-based prior knowledge. In this manner, the GP model incorporates the absent physics of the QS model, and the non-dimensional hybrid formulation enhances its appeal from an aerodynamic perspective. We devise a training procedure that leverages simultaneous input signals of gust angles, based on random free-stream turbulence, and motion angles, based on random broadband signals. We verify the methodology through analytical linear aerodynamics of a flat plate and non-linear aerodynamics of a bridge deck using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The standout feature of the presented methodology is its applicability for aeroelastic buffeting analyses, showcasing robustness when handling broadband excitation. Importantly, the non-linear hybrid model preserves its capability to capture higher-order harmonics in the motion-induced forces and remains applicable for flutter analysis, while incorporating both motion and gust angles as input. Applications of the methodology are anticipated in the aeroelastic analysis and monitoring of slender line-like structures.</description>

      <title>CFD-DEM study of mixing in a monodispersed solid-liquid fluidized bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we assess the internal dynamics of particles in liquid-solid fluidized beds using an unresolved CFD-DEM model. We use the Nearest Neighbors Method (NNM) and the mixing index based on the principal component analysis proposed by Doucet et al. [1] to quantify the bed mixing for several flow regimes and particle properties. Discussions on the advantages and drawbacks of each method are provided. Using results for several inlet flow rates, we show that the dimensionless mixing time reaches a plateau and does not increase significantly with the inlet velocity. The principal component analysis shows that the studied fluidized bed has no preferential mixing component. Additionally, we show that, except for the sliding friction coefficient, the collision properties have almost negligible influence on the mixing behavior.</description>

      <title>Active and inactive contributions to the wall pressure and wall-shear stress in turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phenomenological description is presented to explain the low-frequency/large-scale contributions to the wall-shear-stress (${\tau}_w$) and wall-pressure (${p}_w$) spectra of canonical turbulent boundary layers, which are well known to increase with Reynolds number. The explanation is based on the concept of active and inactive motions (Townsend, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 11, 1961) associated with the attached-eddy hypothesis. Unique data sets of simultaneously acquired ${\tau}_w$, ${p}_w$ and velocity fluctuation time series in the log region are considered, across friction-Reynolds-number ($Re_{\tau}$) range of $\mathcal{O}$($10^3$) $\lesssim$ $Re_{\tau}$ $\lesssim$ $\mathcal{O}$($10^6$). A recently proposed energy-decomposition methodology (Deshpande et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 914, 2021) is implemented to reveal the active and inactive contributions to the ${\tau}_w$- and $p_w$-spectra. Empirical evidence is provided in support of Bradshaw's (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 30, 1967) hypothesis that the inactive motions are responsible for the non-local wall-ward transport of the large-scale inertia-dominated energy, which is produced in the log region by active motions. This explains the large-scale signatures in the ${\tau}_w$-spectrum that are noted, despite negligible large-scale turbulence production near the wall. For wall pressure, active and inactive motions contribute to the $p_w$-spectra at intermediate and large scales, respectively. Their contributions are found to increase with increasing $Re_{\tau}$ due to the broadening and energization of the wall-scaled (attached) eddy hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Joule heating influence on heat transfer and entropy generation in MHD channel flow: A parametric study and ill-posed problem solution using PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study the effects of Joule heating parameter on entropy generation and heat transfer in MHD flow inside a channel is investigated by means of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in form of a parametric analysis in addition to exploring the solution to the ill-posed problem. All of the governing equations are reformulated in terms of first order derivatives and the dimensionless form of the governing equations has been employed to further lessen the number of parameters and achieve better compatibility with loss function terms. Dimensionless groups such as Reynolds number, Prandtl number, Hartmann number and Joule heating parameter have been designated as the input for the neural network in order to perform the parametric study. Besides achieving high accuracy for case of parameters confined in the predefined ranges, the generalization ability of the method is depicted by solving the problem for the cases where the dimensionless parameters were outside of the assumed ranges. Moreover, the ability of handling Neumann boundary conditions is also investigated in the present study despite being neglected prevalently in the literature concerning PINNs. The effects of Joule heating parameter on entropy generation are researched using a parametric approach utilizing PINNs which is another novel aspect of the article at hand. As a concluding remark, an ill-posed problem is also defined such that the Joule heating parameter is included in a learning process and the method has been able to determine Joule heating parameter as a parameter of interest alongside other learnable parameters of the neural network such as weights and biases.</description>

      <title>Thermally-operating regimes for a three-layer liquid metal battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally-operating regimes of a three-layer liquid metal battery are determined in terms of the aspect ratio. The heat exchange between the battery container and the environment is taken into account. Velocity fields and temperature distribution of the convection state inside the battery are determined from numerical simulations. For a chosen geometry, the identified operating regime result in characteristic charge/discharge time close to half a day.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of exit dynamics of a circular cylinder out of water and silicone oil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental investigations of the exit dynamics of a horizontal cylindrical object were performed in water and silicone oil (50 cSt). The fully immersed cylinder was initially at rest in a still fluid tank before being pushed (or pulled according to the measurement procedure) upwards at a constant velocity. Firstly, we demonstrate that these conditions are better satisfied for a large aspect ratio cylinder equipped with vertical side plates. Secondly, the influence of the initial depth on the liquid entrained and the wake generated by the cylinder is discussed. The deformation of the bath is found to be independent of the starting depth when the starting depth is larger than 6 times the cylinder diameter. In the present case, this criterion reflects also the finite acceleration of the cylinder to reach the determined constant exit velocity. Measurements in a range of exit speeds between 0.1 and 1 m/s indicate that the thickness of the liquid above the cylinder, when the cylinder starts crossing the interface, increases with the speed according to a logarithmic law of the Froude number. During the subsequent drainage, the evolution of the coated liquid thickness is found to first decrease exponentially with time just after the crossing of the interface. At later times, a change of regime occurs and the drainage follows the inverse of the square root of time irrespective of the crossing speed. Finally, the force necessary to maintain a constant exit speed during the motion of the cylinder inside and outside the bath is analyzed. This global measurement of the entrained liquid confirms the square root scaling of the thinning with time during the drainage process.</description>

      <title>Analysis of surface tension in terms of force gradient per unit area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally, surface tension is expressed as a force per unit length or as an energy per unit area.In this paper, we propose a thought experiment which consists of replacing the surface tension by an equivalent force gradient following fluid mechanics principles. Such a system of equivalent forces allows to analyze the effects of tensioactivity in terms of force per unit area or in terms of energy per unit volume.This theoretical tool proposes an alternative vision of tensioactivity forces at the interfaces and allows to rewrite the wellknown capillarity equations by calculating forces equilibrium at steady state. The new equations will be applied the case of known phenomena known phenomena such as meniscus, capillary tube, wilhelmy blade and equilibrium of drops and semi-drops.The paper will be concluded by extending our thought experience with the formulation of some hypotheses that would make it possible to interpret such equivalent stress gradients.</description>

      <title>Modelling droplet rebounds off fluid baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order for a droplet to rebound rather than coalesce from a liquid surface, there must be a layer of air persisting throughout the impact. This air layer acts as a lubricant to the system and permits a pressure transfer between the two liquid bodies. Through considering the bath, air, and drop regions of fluid, we introduce a fully coupled reduced dynamic model of two-dimensional droplets rebounding off liquid baths, which incorporates a evolving lubricating air layer. Numerical solutions of the lubrication-mediated model are compared to widely used direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations. The reduced model captures rebounding dynamics well in the regime where it is most relevant: for low speed impacts of small droplets, where capillary forces are important. Numerically, the reduced model is efficient, allowing for the computation of multiple rebounds and of long time dynamics of droplets rebounding on a vibrating bath. Furthermore, the lubrication-mediated model is able to provide detailed information within the air layer such as pressure and lubrication-layer geometry, which is often omitted from reduced models, and typically obtained by higher resolution but higher cost DNS methods.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Visualization Tool for Exploring Parameterized Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the computational study of shock hydrodynamics, i.e. problems involving compressible solids, liquids, and gases that undergo large deformation. These problems are dynamic and nonlinear and can exhibit complex instabilities. Due to advances in high performance computing it is possible to parameterize a hydrodynamic problem and perform a computational study yielding $\mathcal{O}\left({\rm TB}\right)$ of simulation state data. We present an interactive machine learning tool that can be used to compress, browse, and interpolate these large simulation datasets. This tool allows computational scientists and researchers to quickly visualize "what-if" situations, perform sensitivity analyses, and optimize complex hydrodynamic experiments.</description>

      <title>Rocket Exhaust Blowing Soil in Near Vacuum Conditions is Faster than Predicted by Continuum Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments were performed to study how rocket exhaust blows soil in lunar and Martian conditions. Jets of gas were blown downwardly at various granular materials while a camera recorded the formation of scour holes as the material was removed. The experiments were performed in a series of conditions ranging from ambient 101 kPa pressure down to 0.3 kPa. This includes the range that is relevant for lunar conditions, because it is not hard vacuum inside the rocket exhaust where soil is being eroded. Prior work in ambient conditions showed that erosion rate is proportional to the square of the densimetric Froude number. However, the prior work was not performed at low pressures. In the new work, preliminary results show that as the gas density is so low that gas flow around the sand grains is no longer in the continuum regime, then erosion rate is faster than predicted by the earlier results. The dependency of erosion rate on various parameters is determined, but it turns out to be more complex than expected so additional experimental work will be required to develop complete scaling relationships.</description>

      <title>Pade: A code for protoplanetary disk turbulence based on Pade differencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pade code has been developed to treat hydrodynamic turbulence in protoplanetary disks. It solves the compressible equations of motion in cylindrical coordinates. Derivatives are computed using non-diffusive and conservative fourth-order Pade differencing, which has higher resolving power compared to both dissipative shock-capturing schemes used in most astrophysics codes, as well as non-diffusive central finite-difference schemes of the same order. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used for time stepping. A previously reported error-corrected Fargo approach is used to reduce the time step constraint imposed by rapid Keplerian advection. Artificial bulk viscosity is used when shock-capturing is required. Tests for correctness and scaling with respect to the number of processors are presented. Finally, efforts to improve efficiency and accuracy are suggested.</description>

      <title>KPP fronts in shear flows with cut-off reaction rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of a shear flow which has, without loss of generality, a zero mean flow rate, on a Kolmogorov--Petrovskii--Piscounov (KPP) type model in the presence of a discontinuous cut-off at concentration $u = u_c$. Its structure and speed of propagation depends on $A$ (the strength of the flow relative to the propagation speed in the absence of advection) and $B$ (the square of the front thickness relative to the channel width). We use matched asymptotic expansions to approximate the propagation speed in the three natural cases $A\to \infty$, $A\to 0$ and $A=O(1)$, with particular associated orderings on $B$, whilst $u_c\in(0,1)$ remains fixed. In all the cases that we consider, the shear flow enhances the speed of propagation in a manner that is similar to the case without cut-off ($u_c=0$). We illustrate the theory by evaluating expressions (either directly or through numerical integration) for the particular cases of the plane Couette and Poiseuille flows.</description>

      <title>Damping effects of viscous dissipation on growth of symmetric instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric instability (SI) is a frontal instability arising from the interaction of rotation with lateral and vertical shear of a frontal jet and is a generalization of shear, centrifugal, and gravitational instabilities. While the onset of SI has been studied in numerous observations and models, intuition about its growth in physical ocean comes primarily from constant-viscosity linear instability analysis and large eddy simulation (LES). A forward cascade arising from SI in the real ocean, where numerous fine-to-microscale processes interact with growing SI velocity cells, is less understood. While many instances of symmetrically unstable flow have been observed, observations of enhanced turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation ($\epsilon$) at these sites are less common. We use numerical instability analysis of an idealized geostrophic jet to show that viscous-diffusive effects of preexisting turbulence from other turbulent processes (e.g., competing instabilities, internal wave processes, or boundary layer processes) can suppress the growth of SI in the real ocean. For example, a moderate level of ambient turbulence, represented by uniform diffusivity and viscosity of $\kappa =\nu = 10^{-4} m^2/s$, restricts the wavelength range of SI's fastest-growing mode from $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$m to $\mathcal{O}(100)$m and elongates its e-folding timescale by $\mathcal{O}(1-10)$ hrs; suggesting the net viscous-diffusive effects of preexisting turbulence can damp the growth of SI. Viscous damping is one possible explanation for the rarity of SI structures in the real ocean, and our results motivate the inclusion of dependence on previous-timestep $\epsilon$ or $\kappa$ when parameterizing SI in regional models.</description>

Abstract: Since viscoelastic two-phase flows arise in various industrial and natural processes, developing accurate and efficient software for their detailed numerical simulation is a highly relevant and challenging research task. We present a geometrical unstructured Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method for handling two-phase flows with viscoelastic liquid phase, where the latter is modeled via generic rate-type constitutive equations and a one-field description is derived by conditional volume averaging of the local instantaneous bulk equations and interface jump conditions. The method builds on the plicRDF-isoAdvector geometrical VOF solver that is extended and combined with the modular framework DeboRheo for viscoelastic computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A piecewise-linear geometrical interface reconstruction technique on general unstructured meshes is employed for discretizing the viscoelastic stresses across the fluid interface. DeboRheo facilitates a flexible combination of different rheological models with appropriate stabilization methods to address the high Weissenberg number problem.</description>

      <title>Adaptive spectral proper orthogonal decomposition of tonal flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An adaptive algorithm for spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of mixed broadband-tonal turbulent flows is developed. Sharp peak resolution at tonal frequencies is achieved by locally minimizing the bias of the spectrum. Smooth spectrum estimates of broadband regions are achieved by locally reducing the variance of the spectrum. The method utilizes multitaper estimation with sine tapers. An iterative criterion based on modal convergence is introduced to enable the SPOD to adapt to spectral features. For tonal flows, the adaptivity is controlled by a single user input; for broadband flows, a constant number of sine tapers is recommended without adaptivity. The discrete version of Parseval's theorem for SPOD is stated. Proper normalization of the tapers ensures that Parseval's theorem is satisfied in expectation. Drastic savings in computational complexity and memory usage are facilitated by two aspects: (i) sine tapers, which permit post hoc windowing of a single Fourier transform; and (ii) time-domain lossless compression using a QR or eigenvalue decomposition. Sine-taper SPOD is demonstrated on time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) data from an open cavity flow and high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES) data from a round jet, with and without adaptivity. For the tonal cavity flow, the adaptive algorithm outperforms Slepian-based multitaper SPOD in terms of variance and local bias of the spectrum, mode convergence, and memory usage.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning-based active flow control of an elliptical cylinder: transitioning from an elliptical cylinder to a circular cylinder and a flat plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the adaptability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based active flow control (AFC) technology for bluff body flows with complex geometries. It is extended from a cylinder with Ar=1 to a flat elliptical cylinder with Ar=2, slender elliptical cylinders with Ar less than 1, and a flat plate with Ar=0. The robustness and adaptability of DRL-based control technology will be assessed under varying levels of flow instability around bluff bodies. We utilize the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to precisely control the mass flow rates of synthetic jets located on the upper and lower surfaces of a cylinder to achieve reduction in drag, minimization of lift, and suppression of vortex shedding. Our research findings indicate that, for elliptical cylinders with Ar between 1.75 and 0.75, the reduction in drag coefficient ranges from 0.9% to 15.7%, and the reduction in lift coefficient ranges from 95.2% to 99.7%. The DRL-based control strategy not only significantly reduces lift and drag, but also completely suppresses vortex shedding while using less than 1% of external excitation energy, demonstrating its efficiency and energy-saving capabilities. Additionally, for Ar from 0.5 to 0, the reduction in drag coefficient ranges from 26.9% to 43.6%, and the reduction in lift coefficient from 50.2% to 68.0%. This reflects the control strategy's significant reduction in both drag and lift coefficients, while also alleviating vortex shedding. The interaction and nonlinear development of vortices in the wake of elliptical cylinders lead to complex flow instability, and DRL-based AFC technology shows adaptability and potential in addressing flow control problems for this type of bluff body flow.</description>

      <title>Localization and bistability of bioconvection in a doubly periodic domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A suspension of swimming microorganisms often generates a large-scale convective pattern known as bioconvection. In contrast to the thermal Rayleigh-Benard system, recent experimental studies report an emergence of steady localized convection patterns and bistability near the onset of instability in bioconvection systems. In this study, to understand the underlying mechanisms and identify the roles of particle self-propulsion in pattern formation, we theoretically and numerically investigate a model bioconvection system in a two-dimensional periodic boundary domain. In doing so, we extend a standard bioconvection model by introducing the equilibrium density profile as an independent parameter, for which the particle self-propulsion is treated as an independent dimensional parameter. Since the large-scale vertical structure dominates in this system, we are able to simplify the model by truncating the higher vertical modes. With this truncated model, we analytically derived the neutrally stable curve and found that the particle motility stabilizes the system. We then numerically analyzed the bifurcation diagram and found the bistable structure at the onset of instability. These findings, localization and bistability, are consistent with experimental observations. We further examined the global structure of the bistable dynamical system and found that the non-trivial unstable steady solution behaves as an edge state that separates the basins of attractors. These results highlight the importance of particle self-propulsion in bioconvection, and more generally our methodology based on the dynamical systems theory is useful in understanding complex flow patterns in nature.</description>

      <title>Jacobian-Scaled K-means Clustering for Physics-Informed Segmentation of Reacting Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Jacobian-scaled K-means (JSK-means) clustering, which is a physics-informed clustering strategy centered on the K-means framework. The method allows for the injection of underlying physical knowledge into the clustering procedure through a distance function modification: instead of leveraging conventional Euclidean distance vectors, the JSK-means procedure operates on distance vectors scaled by matrices obtained from dynamical system Jacobians evaluated at the cluster centroids. The goal of this work is to show how the JSK-means algorithm -- without modifying the input dataset -- produces clusters that capture regions of dynamical similarity, in that the clusters are redistributed towards high-sensitivity regions in phase space and are described by similarity in the source terms of samples instead of the samples themselves. The algorithm is demonstrated on a complex reacting flow simulation dataset (a channel detonation configuration), where the dynamics in the thermochemical composition space are known through the highly nonlinear and stiff Arrhenius-based chemical source terms. Interpretations of cluster partitions in both physical space and composition space reveal how JSK-means shifts clusters produced by standard K-means towards regions of high chemical sensitivity (e.g., towards regions of peak heat release rate near the detonation reaction zone). The findings presented here illustrate the benefits of utilizing Jacobian-scaled distances in clustering techniques, and the JSK-means method in particular displays promising potential for improving former partition-based modeling strategies in reacting flow (and other multi-physics) applications.</description>

      <title>Formulation and calibration of CATKE, a one-equation parameterization for microscale ocean mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe CATKE, a parameterization for fluxes associated with small-scale or "microscale" ocean turbulent mixing on scales between 1 and 100 meters. CATKE uses a downgradient formulation that depends on a prognostic turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) variable and a diagnostic mixing length scale that includes a dynamic convective adjustment (CA) component. With its dynamic convective mixing length, CATKE predicts not just the depth spanned by convective plumes but also the characteristic convective mixing timescale, an important aspect of turbulent convection not captured by simpler static convective adjustment schemes. As a result, CATKE can describe the competition between convection and other processes such as shear-driven mixing and baroclinic restratification. To calibrate CATKE, we use Ensemble Kalman Inversion to minimize the error between 21 large eddy simulations (LES) and predictions of the LES data by CATKE-parameterized single column simulations at three different vertical resolutions. We find that CATKE makes accurate predictions of both idealized and realistic LES compared to microscale turbulence parameterizations commonly used in climate models.</description>

      <title>Deformation dynamics of an oil droplet into a crescent shape during the intermittent motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A paraffin droplet containing camphor and oil red O (dye) floating on the water surface shows spontaneous motion and deformation generated by the surface tension gradient around the droplet. We focused on the intermittent motion with a pronounced deformation into a crescent shape observed at specific concentrations of camphor and oil red O. We quantitatively analyzed the time changes in the droplet deformation and investigated the role of the oil red O by measuring the time-dependent paraffin/water interfacial tension with the pendant drop method. The observed effect can be explained by the active role of the oil red O molecules at the paraffin/water interface. The interfacial tension decreases gradually after the interface formation, allowing for the dynamic deformation of the droplet. The combination of the decrease in interfacial tension and the reduction in driving force related to camphor outflow generates intermittent motion with dynamic deformation into a crescent shape.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic analog of critical phenomena: an uncountably infinite number of universality classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical phenomena, in which various physical quantities exhibit power laws, have been widely observed in nature and played a central role in physics. They generated the concept of universality class, which origin is elucidated by the renormalization group (RG) theory and which has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, with this version remarkably revealing the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk. The entrained air eventually detaches from the disk with or without breakup involving change in topology. While the time development of the interface shape is self-similar with characteristic length scales exhibiting power laws as in the case of non-confined previous studies, we here found that the observed self-similar shape corresponds to a solution to the governing equations, which we show a stable fixed point of the RG flow by combining a RG analysis and the dynamical system description (DSD) developed for singular dynamics in applied mathematics. We thus demonstrate a striking analogy with critical phenomena, showing critical exponents that define a universality class depend on "continuous numbers" characterizing the confinement. This is in contrast with the conventional critical phenomena, in which a class is defined by "discrete numbers." Our results open a new avenue for our understanding of critical phenomena, RG, and DSD, which impacts on the study of singular dynamics widely observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the incompressible Euler equations describing a stably stratified ocean, reformulated in isopycnal coordinates. Our motivation for using this reformulation is twofold: first, its quasi-2D structure renders some parts of the analysis easier. Second, it closes a gap between the analysis performed in the paper by Bianchini and Duch{\^e}ne in 2022 in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity but with a regularizing term, and the analysis performed in the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020 in Eulerian coordinates, without any regularizing term but without shear velocity. Our main result is an energy estimate in Sobolev spaces on the system in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity, without any regularizing term. With additional assumptions, it is uniform in the shallow-water parameter. The main difficulty consists in transposing to the isopycnal reformulation the symmetric structure of the system which is more straightforward in Eulerian coordinates.</description>
