      <title>Notes on the equiconsistency of ZFC without the Power Set axiom and 2nd order PA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that theories $\text{Z}^-$, $\text{ZF}^-$, $\text{ZFC}^-$ (minus means the absence of the Power Set axiom) and $\text{PA}_2$, $\text{PA}_2^-$ (minus means the absence of the Countable Choice schema) are equiconsistent to each other. The methods used include the interpretation of a power-less set theory in $\text{PA}_2^-$ via well-founded extensional digraphs, as well as the G\"odel constructibility in the said power-less set theory.</description>

      <title>Classifying the complexity of models of arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the possible Scott complexities for models of Peano arithmetic. We construct models of particular complexities by first giving a complete Scott analysis of colored linear orderings and constructing models of Peano arithmetic from these colored orderings. We also provide tight connections of certain Scott complexities with notions from the classical theory of models of Peano arithmetic, such as prime, finitely generated, and recursively saturated. This effort provides a powerful set of tools to understand the models of Peano arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Sheaf of Residuated Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the interface between algebra, topology, and logic by developing the theory of sheaves and etale spaces for residuated lattices, algebraic structures central to substructural and fuzzy logics. We construct stalkwise-residuated etale spaces and demonstrate that they form a subcategory of the category of etale spaces of sets. A categorical and topological characterization of the sheaf condition is presented, with particular emphasis on filters, congruences, and the topologies induced on prime spectra.</description>

      <title>Fixed points on null and tame flows for groups of automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a generalization of the Kechris-Pestov-Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} correspondence due to Nguyen Van Th\'{e} we obtain fixed point theorems for null and tame actions of groups of the form $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal F)$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} structure. In particular we show that if $\mathrm{Age}(\mathcal F)$ is a free joint embedding class, then every null flow $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal F)\curvearrowright X$ has a fixed point, while if $\mathrm{Age}(\mathcal F)$ is a free amalgamation class, then every tame flow $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal F)\curvearrowright X$ has a fixed point.</description>

      <title>A modal approach towards substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substitutions play a crucial role in a wide range of contexts, from analyzing the dynamics of social opinions and conducting mathematical computations to engaging in game-theoretical analysis. For many situations, considering one-step substitutions is often adequate. Yet, for more complex cases, iterative substitutions become indispensable. In this article, our primary focus is to study logical frameworks that model both single-step and iterative substitutions. We explore a number of properties of these logics, including their expressive strength, Hilbert-style proof systems, and satisfiability problems. Additionally, we establish connections between our proposed frameworks and relevant existing ones in the literature. For instance, we precisely delineate the relationship between single-step substitutions and the standard syntactic replacements commonly found in many classical logics. Moreover, special emphasis is placed on iterative substitutions. In this context, we compare our proposed framework with existing ones involving iterative reasoning, thereby highlighting the advantages of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Logics with the axiom of convergence: complexity with a small number of variables in the language (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that many modal and superintuitionistic logics are PSPACE-hard in languages with a small number of variables; however, questions about the complexity of similar fragments of many logics obtained by adding various axioms to "standard" ones remain unexplored. We investigate the complexity of fragments of modal logics obtained by adding an axiom requiring the convergence of the accessibility relation in Kripke frames: S4.2, K4.2, Grz.2, and GL.2. The main result is that S4.2 and Grz.2 are PSPACE-complete in a language with two variables, while K4.2 and GL.2 are PSPACE-complete in a language with one variable. The obtained results are extended to infinite classes of logics.</description>

      <title>Term Assignment and Categorical Models for Intuitionistic Linear Logic with Subexponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a typed lambda calculus ${\bf SILL}(\lambda)_{\Sigma}$, a type-theoretic version of intuitionistic linear logic with subexponentials, that is, we have many resource comonadic modalities with some interconnections between them given by a subexponential signature. We also give proof normalisation rules and prove the strong normalisation and Church-Rosser properties for $\beta$-reduction by adapting the Tait-Girard method to subexponential modalities. Further, we analyse subexponentials from the point of view of categorical logic. We introduce the concepts of a Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage to characterise models of linear type theories with a single exponential and affine and relevant subexponentials and a more general case respectively. We also generalise several known results from linear logic and show that every Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage can be viewed as a symmetric monoidal closed category equipped with a family of monoidal adjunctions of a particular kind. In the final section, we give a stronger 2-categorical characterisation of Cocteau categories.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Exponent Partition Relations on the Real Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of infinite-exponent partition relations to arbitrary linear order types, with a particular focus on the real number line. We give a complete classification of all consistent partition relations on the real line with countably infinite exponents, and a characterisation of the statement "no uncountable-exponent partition relations hold on the real line", working throughout in ZF without the Axiom of Choice.</description>

      <title>Hanf Locality and Invariant Elementary Definability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce some notions of invariant elementary definability which extend the notions of first-order order-invariant definability, and, more generally, definability invariant with respect to arbitrary numerical relations. In particular, we study invariance with respect to expansions which depend not only on (an ordering of) the universe of a structure, but also on the particular relations which determine the structure; we call such expansions \emph{presentations} of a structure. We establish two locality results in this context. The first is an extension of the original Hanf Locality Theorem to boolean queries which are invariantly definable over classes of locally finite structures with respect to \emph{elementary, neighborhood-bounded} presentations. The second is a non-uniform version of the Fagin-Stockmeyer-Vardi Hanf Threshold Locality Theorem to boolean queries which are invariantly definable over classes of bounded degree structures with respect to elementary, neighborhood-bounded, \emph{local} presentations.</description>

Abstract: Relations and interactions between the theorems of Ash, Herwig-Lascar and Ribes-Zalesskii are discussed and it is shown that these three theorems are equivalent in the sense that each of them can be derived from each other one. Some strengthening of these theorems that can be obtained by use of the groups provided by the third author's construction are also considered.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Borel liftings in complex analysis and PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Borel equivariant analogues of several classical theorems from complex analysis and PDE. The starting point is an equivariant Weierstrass theorem for entire functions: there exists a Borel mapping which assigns to each non-periodic positive divisor $d$ an entire function $f_d$ with divisor of zeros $\mathrm{div}(f_d)=d$ and which commutes with translation, $f_{d-w}(z)=f_d(z+w)$. We also examine the existence of equivariant Borel right inverses for the distributional Laplacian, the heat operator, and the $\bar{\partial}$-operator on the space of smooth functions. We demonstrate that Borel equivariant inverses for these maps exist on the free part of the range (for the heat operator, this holds up to the removal of a null set with respect to any invariant probability measure). In general, the freeness assumptions cannot be omitted and Borelness cannot be strengthened to continuity. Our positive results follow from a theorem establishing sufficient conditions for the existence of equivariant Borel liftings. Two key ingredients are Runge-type approximation theorems and the existence of Borel toasts, which are Borel analogues of Rokhlin towers from ergodic theory.</description>

      <title>On the Compatibility of Constructive Predicative Mathematics with Weyl's Classical Predicativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that most constructive and predicative foundations aiming to develop Bishop's constructive analysis are incompatible with a classical predicative development of analysis as put forward by Weyl in his $\textit{Das Kontinuum}$. Here, we show how this incompatibility arises from the possibility to define sets by quantifying over (the exponentiation of) functional relations. Such a possibility is present in most constructive foundations but it is not allowed in modern reformulations of Weyl's logical system. In particular, we show how in Aczel's Constructive Set Theory, Martin-L\"of's type theory and Homotopy Type Theory, the incompatibility with classical predicativity \`a la Weyl reduces to the fact of being able to interpret Heyting arithmetic in all finite types with the addition of the internal rule of number-theoretic unique choice, identifying functional relations over natural numbers with a primitive notion of function defined as $\lambda$-terms of type theory. Then, we argue that a possible way out is offered by constructive foundations, such as the Minimalist Foundation, where exponentiation is limited to functions defined as $\lambda$-terms of (dependent) type theory. The price to pay is to renounce number-theoretic choice principles, including the rule of unique choice, typical of most foundations formalizing Bishop's constructive mathematics. This restriction calls for a point-free constructive development of topology as advocated by P. Martin-L\"of and G. Sambin with the introduction of Formal Topology. We then conclude that the Minimalist Foundation promises to be a natural crossroads between Bishop's constructivism and Weyl's classical predicativity provided that a point-free constructive reformulation of analysis is viable.</description>

      <title>Quantifying calibration error in modern neural networks through evidence based theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthiness in neural networks is crucial for their deployment in critical applications, where reliability, confidence, and uncertainty play pivotal roles in decision-making. Traditional performance metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture these aspects, particularly in cases where models exhibit overconfidence. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework for quantifying the trustworthiness of neural networks by incorporating subjective logic into the evaluation of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). This method provides a comprehensive measure of trust, disbelief, and uncertainty by clustering predicted probabilities and fusing opinions using appropriate fusion operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, where post-calibration results indicate improved trustworthiness. The proposed framework offers a more interpretable and nuanced assessment of AI models, with potential applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and autonomous systems.</description>
