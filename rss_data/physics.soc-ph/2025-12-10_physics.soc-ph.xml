      <title>Analysis of the Sybil defense of Duniter-based cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duniter-based cryptocurrencies, which are providing a kind of universal basic income, are using a system called "Web of Trust" based on a social network whose evolution is subject to graph theoretical rules, time constraints and a licence in order to avoid large Sybil attacks. We investigate in this article the largest size of a Sybil attack that a simplified version of the graph theoretical rules of a Web of Trust can undergo depending on the number of attackers and on the parameters of the system. We show that even if in theory, without considering social and time constraints, this system cannot in general prevent huge attacks, in the real-world case of a Duniter-based cryptocurrency (with thousands of users), the system can prevent attacks of large size with only graph theoretical rules.</description>

      <title>Renewable Energies in the Agricultural Sector: A Perspective Analysis of the Last Three Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last three years, research on the application of renewable energies in the agricultural sector has grown significantly. In this study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of global scientific production from 2019 to 2021 to identify trends, leading contributors, and emerging research areas. Based on 1378 documents retrieved from Scopus, we observed a clear upward trend in publications, with a peak in 2021. India, China, the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom were the most productive countries, while key institutions from China, Iran, and the Netherlands led the research output. Our results reveal five major thematic clusters: renewable energy technologies in agriculture, bioenergy, sustainable agriculture, biomass energy, and the environmental impact of agricultural activities. Notable advances include agrovoltaic systems, the use of agricultural and livestock waste for biogas production, and the development of agricultural robots powered by renewable energy sources. Additionally, there is increasing interest in examining the links among agriculture, renewable energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions, aligned with global sustainability goals. This analysis highlights the evolution of the field, international collaboration patterns, and the most influential research lines, offering valuable insights to guide future scientific developments in integrating renewable energies within the agricultural sector.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy of population level approximation of network processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The individual-based model of simple contagion processes is considered on regular graphs. This model explicitly incorporates the adjacency matrix of the network enabling us to study the effect of network structure on the dynamic of the propagation process. While the asymptotic behaviour of the model is well known, the transient behaviour has been less studied. Our goal in this paper is to give a theoretical estimate on the accuracy of the one-dimensional population-level approximation. This is carried out for arbitrary simple contagion processes and regular Tur\'an graphs. Numerical evidence is shown that the theoretical estimate is rather sharp for dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Restoring Network Evolution from Static Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of complex networks underpins the structure-function relationships in natural and artificial systems. Yet, restoring a network's formation from a single static snapshot remains challenging. Here, we present a transferable machine learning framework that infers network evolutionary trajectories solely from present topology. By integrating graph neural networks with transformers, our approach unlocks a latent temporal dimension directly from the static topology. Evaluated across diverse domains, the framework achieves high transfer accuracy of up to 95.3%, demonstrating its robustness and transferability. Applied to the Drosophila brain connectome, it restores the formation times of over 2.6 million neural connections, revealing that early-forming links support essential behaviors such as mating and foraging, whereas later-forming connections underpin complex sensory and social functions. These results demonstrate that a substantial fraction of evolutionary information is encoded within static network architecture, offering a powerful, general tool for elucidating the hidden temporal dynamics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Critical Thresholds in Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions for Epidemic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08339v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as contact tracing and social distancing, are critical for controlling epidemic outbreaks, yet their dynamic interactions remain underexplored. We introduce a probabilistic framework to analyze the synergy between contact tracing speed, quantified by the contact tracing period $\tau$, and the average number of close contacts, $\bar{k}_+$, reflecting social distancing measures. We identify critical thresholds ($R=1$) that separate pandemic and contained phases in the $\bar{k}_{+}-\tau$ plane, validated using high-resolution data from Shenzhen's 2022 Omicron outbreak (1,187 cases, 86,451 contacts). Our findings show that contact tracing alone can contain diseases with $R_0 &lt; 2.12$ (95% CI 2.07-2.16), covering 43.33% of major infectious diseases, while combining with social distancing extends control to $R_0 &lt; 7.82$ (95% CI 7.70-7.93), encompassing 86.67% of pathogens. These results, supported by empirical data, highlight the efficacy of rapid tracing and targeted social distancing as alternatives to mass PCR testing. Our framework offers actionable insights for optimizing NPI strategies, though challenges in scaling to regions with higher tracing miss rates or weaker infrastructure underscore the need for adaptive, data-driven policies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive cut reveals multiscale complexity in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical clustering and community detection are important problems in machine learning and complex network analysis. A common approach to identify clusters is to simply cut dendrograms at some threshold. However, single-level cuts are often suboptimal in terms of capturing underlying structure in the data, especially when the dendrogram is unbalanced. In this paper, we present the adaptive cut, a novel method that leverages the hierarchical structure of dendrograms by employing multi-level cuts to overcome the limitations of single-level approaches. The adaptive cut optimizes an objective function using a Markov chain Monte Carlo with simulated annealing, resulting in better partitions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive cut through applications to link clustering and modularity optimization, but note that the method is applicable to any clustering task that relies on a dendrogram and an objective function. Beyond the adaptive cut, we introduce the balancedness score, an information-theoretic metric that quantifies how balanced a dendrogram is. Balancedness predicts the potential benefits of using multi-level cuts. For the community detection examples, we evaluate our method on more than 200 real-world networks and multiple synthetic datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in partition density and modularity over traditional single-cut approaches. In addition, we show the generality of the adaptive cut by applying it across various hierarchical clustering techniques and objective functions. Our results indicate that the adaptive cut provides a robust and versatile tool for improving clustering outcomes.</description>

      <title>Cultural evolution of human beauty standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beauty standards shape self-perception and health through social comparison and objectification, while exposure to idealized imagery exacerbates body-image concerns. Media and fashion are central arbiters of these ideals, yet long-term, quantitative, intersectional studies on how representation has changed remain scarce. We assembled a dataset of 793199 records spanning 25 years of advertising, magazine covers, runway shows, and editorials to quantify changes in anthropometric and demographic representation. We find a paradox in the evolution of beauty ideals: while representational diversity has increased, the median model physique remains stable. This is driven by selective plus-size inclusion at the upper tail, while the typical physique continues to diverge from the US population. Intersectionally, non-white models are 4.5 times more likely to be plus-size, indicating that progress in size inclusivity falls disproportionately on multiple underrepresented identities. Stratifying the industry via a data-driven prestige hierarchy, we find that thinness is overrepresented at the top tier. Finally, comparing two regulatory interventions we observe that numeric thresholds are more effective at reducing underweight appearances. Our results quantify the cultural evolution in media and fashion, revealing that inclusion has increased; however, gains are uneven and intersectionally concentrated on size and ethnicity, whereas the prevailing thin ideal remains largely unchanged.</description>

      <title>Joint economic and epidemiological modelling of alternative pandemic response strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an emerging pandemic, policymakers need to make important decisions with limited information, for example choosing between a mitigation, suppression or elimination strategy. These strategies may require trade-offs to be made between the health impact of the pandemic and the economic costs of the interventions introduced in response. Mathematical models are a useful tool that can help understand the consequences of alternative policy options on the future dynamics and impact of the epidemic. Most models have focused on direct health impacts, neglecting the economic costs of control measures. Here, we introduce a model framework that captures both health and economic costs. We use this framework to compare the expected aggregate costs of mitigation, suppression and elimination strategies, across a range of different epidemiological and economic parameters. We find that for diseases with low severity, mitigation tends to be the most cost-effective option. For more severe diseases, suppression tends to be most cost effective if the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is relatively low, while elimination tends to be more cost-effective if $R_0$ is high. We use the example of New Zealand's elimination response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 to anchor our framework to a real-world case study. We find that parameter estimates for Covid-19 in New Zealand put it close to or above the threshold at which elimination becomes more cost-effective than mitigation. We conclude that our proposed framework holds promise as a decision-support tool for future pandemic threats, although further work is needed to account for population heterogeneity and other factors relevant to decision-making.</description>

      <title>Observing network dynamics through sentinel nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental premise of statistical physics is that the particles in a physical system are interchangeable, and hence the state of each specific component is representative of the system as a whole. This assumption breaks down for complex networks, in which nodes may be extremely diverse, and no single component can truly represent the state of the entire system. It seems, therefore, that to observe the dynamics of social, biological or technological networks, one must extract the dynamic states of a large number of nodes -- a task that is often practically prohibitive. Theoretical tools are also highly restrictive, given the analytically impenetrable combination of complex heterogeneous networks with nonlinear, often hidden, dynamics. To overcome this challenge, we use machine learning techniques to detect the network's sentinel nodes, a set of network components whose combined states can help approximate the average dynamics of the entire network. The method allows us to assess the equilibrium state of a large complex system by tracking just a small number of carefully selected nodes. We find that the sentinels are mainly determined by the network structure such that they can be extracted even with little knowledge of the system's specific interaction dynamics. Therefore, the network's sentinels offer a natural probe by which to observe the system's dynamic states. Intriguingly, sentinels tend to avoid the highly central nodes such as the hubs.</description>

      <title>Multivariable Behavioral Change Modeling of Epidemics in the Presence of Undetected Infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemic models are invaluable tools to understand and implement strategies to control the spread of infectious diseases, as well as to inform public health policies and resource allocation. However, current modeling approaches have limitations that reduce their practical utility, such as the exclusion of human behavioral change in response to the epidemic or ignoring the presence of undetected infectious individuals in the population. These limitations became particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the need for more accurate and informative models. To address these challenges, we develop a novel Bayesian epidemic modeling framework to better capture the complexities of disease spread by incorporating behavioral responses and undetected infections. In particular, our framework makes three contributions: 1) leveraging additional data on hospitalizations and deaths in modeling the disease dynamics, 2) accounting for data uncertainty arising from the large presence of asymptomatic and undetected infections, and 3) allowing the population behavioral change to be dynamically influenced by multiple data sources (cases and deaths). We thoroughly investigate the properties of the proposed model via simulation, and illustrate its utility on COVID-19 data from Montreal and Miami.</description>

      <title>Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, information locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks (ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate counterfactual analysis for policy interventions</description>
