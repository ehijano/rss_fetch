      <title>Quantum Groups and Symplectic Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and $V$ a finite-dimensional representation of $G$. Costello-Gaiotto studied a graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak{d}_{\mathfrak{g}, V}$ and the associated affine Kac-Moody algebra. In this paper, we show that this Lie algebra can be made into a sheaf of Lie algebras over $T^*[V/G]=[\mu^{-1}(0)/G]$, where $\mu: T^*V\to \mathfrak{g}^*$ is the moment map. We identify this sheaf of Lie algebras with the tangent Lie algebra of the stack $T^*[V/G]$. Moreover, we show that there is an equivalence of braided tensor categories between the bounded derived category of graded modules of $\mathfrak{d}_{\mathfrak{g}, V}$ and graded perfect complexes of $[\mu^{-1}(0)/G]$.</description>

      <title>Characters of symmetric groups: sharp bounds on virtual degrees and the Witten zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sharp bounds on the virtual degrees introduced by Larsen and Shalev. This leads to improved bounds on character of symmetric groups. We then sharpen bounds of Liebeck and Shalev concerning the Witten zeta function. As an application, we characterize the fixed-point free conjugacy classes whose associated random walk mixes in 2 steps.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry, tropical geometry and representation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ideal filling is a combinatorial object introduced by Judd that amounts to expressing a dominant weight $\lambda$ of $SL_n$ as a rational sum of the positive roots in a canonical way, such that the coefficients satisfy a $\max$ relation. He proved that whenever an ideal filling has integral coefficients it corresponds to a lattice point in the interior of the string polytope which parametrises the canonical basis of the representation with highest weight $\lambda$. The work of Judd makes use of a construction of string polytopes via the theory of geometric crystals, and involves tropicalising the superpotential of the flag variety $SL_n/B$ in certain `string' coordinates. He shows that each ideal filling relates to a positive critical point of the superpotential over the field of Puiseux series, through a careful analysis of the critical point conditions.
  In this thesis we give a new interpretation of ideal fillings, together with a parabolic generalisation. For every dominant weight $\lambda$ of $GL_n$, we also define a new family of polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^{R_+}$, where $R_+$ denotes the positive roots of $GL_n$, with one polytope for each reduced expression of the longest element of the Weyl group. These polytopes are related by piecewise-linear transformations which fix the ideal filling associated to $\lambda$ as a point in the interior of each of these polytopes.
  Our main technical tool is a new coordinate system in which to express the superpotential, which we call the `ideal' coordinates. We describe explicit transformations between these coordinates and string coordinates in the $GL_n/B$ case.
  Finally, we demonstrate a close relation between our new interpretation of ideal fillings and factorisations of Toeplitz matrices into simple root subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. If $F$ has even residual characteristic, we assume $F/\mathbb{Q}_2$ is unramified. Let $V$ be a depth zero, irreducible, nongeneric supercuspidal representation of $GSp(4, F)$. We calculate the dimensions of the spaces of Siegel-invariant vectors in $V$ of level $\mathfrak{p}^n$ for all $n\geq0$.</description>

      <title>Tannakian QFT: from spark algebras to quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonperturbative construction of Hopf algebras that represent categories of line operators in topological quantum field theory, in terms of semi-extended operators (spark algebras) on pairs of transverse topological boundary conditions. The construction is a direct implementation of Tannakian formalism in QFT. Focusing on d=3 dimensional theories, we find topological definitions of R-matrices, ribbon twists, and the Drinfeld double construction for generalized quantum groups. We illustrate our construction in finite-group gauge theory, and apply it to obtain new results for B-twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, a.k.a. equivariant Rozansky-Witten theory, or supergroup BF theory (including ordinary BF theory with compact gauge group). We reformulate our construction mathematically in terms of abelian and dg tensor categories, and discuss connections with Koszul duality.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Mutation-Acyclicity of Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in mathematical research in recent years. This paper applies ML techniques to the study of quivers--a type of directed multigraph with significant relevance in algebra, combinatorics, computer science, and mathematical physics. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of determining the mutation-acyclicity of a quiver on 4 vertices, a property that is pivotal since mutation-acyclicity is often a necessary condition for theorems involving path algebras and cluster algebras. Although this classification is known for quivers with at most 3 vertices, little is known about quivers on more than 3 vertices. We give a computer-assisted proof of a theorem to prove that mutation-acyclicity is decidable for quivers on 4 vertices with edge weight at most 2. By leveraging neural networks (NNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), we then accurately classify more general 4-vertex quivers as mutation-acyclic or non-mutation-acyclic. Our results demonstrate that ML models can efficiently detect mutation-acyclicity, providing a promising computational approach to this combinatorial problem, from which the trained SVM equation provides a starting point to guide future theoretical development.</description>

      <title>Projective Rigidity of Once-Punctured Torus Bundles via the Twisted Alexander Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a means of certifying infinitesimal projective rigidity relative to the cusp for hyperbolic once punctured torus bundles in terms of twisted Alexander polynomials of representations associated to the holonomy. We also relate this polynomial to an induced action on the tangent space of the character variety of the free group of rank 2 into PGL(4,R) that arises from the holonomy of a hyperbolic once-punctured torus bundle. We prove the induced action on the tangent space of the character variety is the same as the group theoretic action that arises in the Lyndon Hochschild Serre spectral sequence on cohomology.</description>

      <title>Complexity theory of orbit closure intersection for tensors: reductions, completeness, and graph isomorphism hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many natural computational problems in computer science, mathematics, physics, and other sciences amount to deciding if two objects are equivalent. Often this equivalence is defined in terms of group actions. A natural question is to ask when two objects can be distinguished by polynomial functions that are invariant under the group action. For finite groups, this is the usual notion of equivalence, but for continuous groups like the general linear groups it gives rise to a new notion, called orbit closure intersection. It captures, among others, the graph isomorphism problem, noncommutative PIT, null cone problems in invariant theory, equivalence problems for tensor networks, and the classification of multiparty quantum states. Despite recent algorithmic progress in celebrated special cases, the computational complexity of general orbit closure intersection problems is currently quite unclear. In particular, tensors seem to give rise to the most difficult problems.
  In this work we start a systematic study of orbit closure intersection from the complexity-theoretic viewpoint. To this end, we define a complexity class TOCI that captures the power of orbit closure intersection problems for general tensor actions, give an appropriate notion of algebraic reductions that imply polynomial-time reductions in the usual sense, but are amenable to invariant-theoretic techniques, identify natural tensor problems that are complete for TOCI, including the equivalence of 2D tensor networks with constant physical dimension, and show that the graph isomorphism problem can be reduced to these complete problems, hence GI$\subseteq$TOCI. As such, our work establishes the first lower bound on the computational complexity of orbit closure intersection problems, and it explains the difficulty of finding unconditional polynomial-time algorithms beyond special cases, as has been observed in the literature.</description>

      <title>A characterization of socular highest weight modules and Richardson orbits of classical types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a simple complex Lie algebra of classical type with a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$. We fix a standard parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}\supset \mathfrak{h}$. The socular simple modules are just those highest weight modules with largest possible Gelfand-Kirillov dimension in the corresponding parabolic category $\mathcal{O}^{\mathfrak{p}}$. In this article, we will give an explicit characterization for these modules. When the module is integral, our characterization is given by the information of the corresponding Young tableau associated to the given highest weight module. When the module is nonintegral, we still have some characterization by using the results in the integral case. In our characterization, we define a particular Young diagram called Z-diagram. From this diagram, we can describe the partition type of the unique Richardson orbit associated to the given parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}$.</description>

      <title>Monogamous subvarieties of the nilpotent cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $k$ of prime characteristic not $2$, whose Lie algebra is denoted $\mathfrak{g}$. We call a subvariety $\mathfrak{X}$ of the nilpotent cone $N \subset \mathfrak{g}$ monogamous if for every $e\in \mathfrak{X}$, the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triples $(e,h,f)$ with $f\in \mathfrak{X}$ are conjugate under the centraliser $C_G(e)$. Building on work by the first two authors, we show there is a unique maximal closed $G$-stable monogamous subvariety $V \subset N$ and that it is an orbit closure, hence irreducible. We show that $V$ can also be characterised in terms of Serre's $G$-complete reducibility.</description>
