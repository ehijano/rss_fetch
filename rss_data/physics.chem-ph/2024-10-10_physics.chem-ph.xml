      <title>Full Quantum dynamics study for H atom scattering from graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study deals with the understanding of hydrogen atom scattering from graphene, a process critical for exploring C-H bond formation and energy transfer during the atom surface collision. In our previous work (J.Chem.Phys \textbf{159}, 194102, (2023)), starting from a cell with 24 carbon atoms treated periodically, we have achieved quantum dynamics (QD) simulations with a reduced-dimensional model (15D) and a simulation in full dimensionality (75D). In the former work, the H atom attacked the top of a single C atom, enabling a comparison of QD simulation results with classical molecular dynamics (cMD). Our approach required the use of sophisticated techniques such as Monte Carlo Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (MCCPD) and Multilayer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), as well as a further development of quantum flux calculations. We could benchmark our calculations by comparison with cMD calculations. We have now refined our method to better mimic experimental conditions. Specifically, rather than sending the H atom to a specific position on the surface, we have employed a plane wave for the H atom in directions parallel to the surface. Key findings for these new simulations include the identification of discrepancies between classical molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations and experiments, which are attributed to both the potential energy surface (PES) and quantum effects. Additionally, the study sheds light on the role of classical collective normal modes during collisions, providing insights into energy transfer processes. The results validate the robustness of our simulation methodologies and highlight the importance of considering quantum mechanical effects in the study of hydrogen-graphene interactions.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation in Coulomb explosion of hydrocarbon molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragmentation dynamics in the Coulomb explosion of hydrocarbons, specifically methane, ethane, propane, and butane, are investigated using time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations. The goal of this work is to elucidate the distribution of fragments generated under laser-driven Coulomb explosion conditions. Detailed analysis reveals the types of fragments formed, their respective charge states, and the optimal laser intensities required for achieving various fragmentations. Our results indicate distinct fragmentation patterns for each hydrocarbon, correlating with the molecular structure and ionization potential. Additionally, we identify the laser parameters that maximize fragmentation efficiency, providing valuable insights for experimental setups. This research advances our understanding of Coulomb explosion mechanisms and offers a foundation for further studies in controlled molecular fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Is animal magnetoreception quantum? A perspective from the energy resolution limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large number of magnetic sensors, like superconducting quantum interference devices, optical pumping and nitrogen vacancy magnetometers, were shown to satisfy the energy resolution limit. This limit states that the magnetic sensitivity of the sensor, when translated into a product of energy with time, is bounded below by Planck's constant, $\hbar$. This bound implies a fundamental limitation as to what can be achieved in magnetic sensing. Here we explore biological magnetometers, in particular three magnetoreception mechanisms thought to underly animals' geomagnetic field sensing: the radical-pair, the magnetite and the MagR mechanism. We address the question of how close these mechanisms approach the energy resolution limit. At the quantitative level, the utility of the energy resolution limit is that it informs the workings of magnetic sensing in model-independent ways, and thus can provide subtle consistency checks for theoretical models and estimated or measured parameter values, particularly needed in complex biological systems. At the qualitative level, the closer the energy resolution is to $\hbar$, the more \enquote{quantum} is the sensor. This offers an alternative route towards understanding the quantum biology of magnetoreception. It also quantifies the room for improvement, illuminating what Nature has achieved, and stimulating the engineering of biomimetic sensors exceeding Nature's magnetic sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Porous carbon nitride fullerenes: a novel family of porous cage molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study theoretically a novel family of cage molecules, the porous carbon nitride fullerenes (PCNFs), which can be considered the zero-dimensional counterparts of the two-dimensional porous graphitic carbon nitrides, in accordance with icosahedral fullerenes, representing the zero-dimensional counterpart of graphene. We focus on two representative members of the PCNF family, the icosahedral C$_{60}$N$_{60}$ and C$_{120}$N$_{60}$ which are the first members of the two main sub-families of these structures derived from the class I and II Goldberg polyhedra, respectively. Taking into account that the two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitrides are considered the next-generation materials for several interesting applications, the interest in their zero-dimension counterparts is obvious. In the present study, we utilize Density Functional Theory to find their structural, vibrational, and electronic properties. The stability of the proposed cages was demonstrated through vibrational analysis and molecular dynamics simulations with ReaxFF potentials. Regarding thermal stability, we found that C$_{60}$N$_{60}$ could be stable well above 1000 K and C$_{120}$N$_{60}$ well above 2000 K. Finally, we discuss several ideas regarding precursors that could be possibly used for their bottom-up synthesis.</description>

      <title>High-Spin State Dynamics and Quintet-Mediated Emission in Intramolecular Singlet Fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-spin states in molecular systems hold significant interest for a wide range of applications ranging from optoelectronics to quantum information and singlet fission (SF). Quintet and triplet states play crucial roles, particularly in SF systems, necessitating a precise monitoring and control of their spin dynamics. Spin states in intramolecular SF (iSF) are of particular interest, but tuning these systems to control triplet multiplication pathways has not been extensively studied. Additionally, whilst studies in this context focus on participation of triplet pathways leading to photoluminescence, emission pathways via quintet states remain largely unexplored. Here, we employ a set of unique spin-sensitive techniques to investigate high-spin state formation and emission in dimers and trimers comprising multiple diphenylhexatriene (DPH) units. We demonstrate the formation of pure quintet states in all these oligomers, with optical emission via quintet states dominating delayed fluorescence up to room temperature. For triplet formation, we distinguish between SF and ISC pathways, identifying the trimer Me-(DPH)$_3$ as the only oligomer exhibiting exclusively the desired SF pathways. Conversely, linear (DPH)$_3$ and (DPH)$_2$ show additional or exclusive triplet pathways via ISC. Our comprehensive analysis provides a detailed investigation into high-spin state formation, control, and emission in intramolecular singlet fission systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Equivariant Non-Local Electron Density Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks. EG-XC combines semi-local functionals with a non-local feature density parametrized by an equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud representation of the electron density to capture long-range interactions. By differentiating through a self-consistent field solver, we train EG-XC requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</description>

      <title>Doob's Lagrangian: A Sample-Efficient Variational Approach to Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's $h$-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing equivariant representations in molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent equivariant models have shown significant progress in not just chemical property prediction, but as surrogates for dynamical simulations of molecules and materials. Many of the top performing models in this category are built within the framework of tensor products, which preserves equivariance by restricting interactions and transformations to those that are allowed by symmetry selection rules. Despite being a core part of the modeling process, there has not yet been much attention into understanding what information persists in these equivariant representations, and their general behavior outside of benchmark metrics. In this work, we report on a set of experiments using a simple equivariant graph convolution model on the QM9 dataset, focusing on correlating quantitative performance with the resulting molecular graph embeddings. Our key finding is that, for a scalar prediction task, many of the irreducible representations are simply ignored during training -- specifically those pertaining to vector ($l=1$) and tensor quantities ($l=2$) -- an issue that does not necessarily make itself evident in the test metric. We empirically show that removing some unused orders of spherical harmonics improves model performance, correlating with improved latent space structure. We provide a number of recommendations for future experiments to try and improve efficiency and utilization of equivariant features based on these observations.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Phase-Field Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-field methods offer a versatile computational framework for simulating large-scale microstructure evolution. However, the applicability and predictability of phase-field models are inherently limited by their ad hoc nature, and there is currently no bottom-up theory available that enables truly first-principles predictive modeling of large-scale non-equilibrium processes. Here, we present a bottom-up framework that provides a route to the construction of mesoscopic phase-field models entirely based on atomistic information. By introducing a molecular coarse-grained system as an intermediate step, we demonstrate the approach on the example of ice nucleation dynamics, with a spatiotemporal scale-up of nearly $10^8$ times compared to the microscopic model. Our framework offers a unique approach for incorporating atomistic details into mesoscopic models, systematically bridging the gap between microscopic particle-based simulations and field-theoretic models.</description>

      <title>Imaging coupled vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics triggered by interaction with light often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Characterizing the resulting coupled electronic and nuclear wave packet motion represents a severe challenge, even for small polyatomic systems. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) in combination with quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the role of the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. A conical intersection between these states couples the bending and asymmetric stretching coordinates, which is clearly reflected in the correlated fragment momenta. Our results suggest that multi-coincident CEI represents an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</description>

Abstract: In theory, two extreme forms of substances exist:the pure form and the single-molecule mixture form. The latter contains a mixture of molecules with molecularly different structures.Inspired by the "chemical space"concept, I recently reported a study of the single-molecule mixture state that combines model construction and mathematical analysis,obtaining some interesting results.(Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024,25,7571.) In this preprint,a detailed discussion of the concept of "single-molecule mixture" has been provided.</description>

      <title>Stability-Aware Training of Machine Learning Force Fields with Differentiable Boltzmann Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations, limiting their ability to model phenomena occurring over longer timescales and compromising the quality of estimated observables. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which leverages joint supervision from reference quantum-mechanical calculations and system observables. StABlE Training iteratively runs many MD simulations in parallel to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. We achieve efficient end-to-end automatic differentiation through MD simulations using our Boltzmann Estimator, a generalization of implicit differentiation techniques to a broader class of stochastic algorithms. Unlike existing techniques based on active learning, our approach requires no additional ab-initio energy and forces calculations to correct instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, using three modern MLFF architectures. StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability, data efficiency, and agreement with reference observables. By incorporating observables into the training process alongside first-principles calculations, StABlE Training can be viewed as a general semi-empirical framework applicable across MLFF architectures and systems. This makes it a powerful tool for training stable and accurate MLFFs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets.</description>
