      <title>Antagonistic coinfection in rock-paper-scissors models during concurrent epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of dual disease epidemics within the spatial rock-paper-scissors model. In this framework, individuals from all species are equally susceptible to infection by two distinct pathogens transmitted via person-to-person contact. We assume antagonistic mortality, where the simultaneous occurrence of coinfection reduces the probability of host mortality due to complications arising from either coexisting disease. Specifically, we explore two scenarios: global antagonism, where the presence of one pathogen inhibits the progression of the other in coinfected hosts, and uneven antagonism, where only one pathogen affects the development of the other. Using stochastic simulations, we show that the characteristic length scale of the spatial patterns emerging from random initial conditions diminishes as antagonism becomes more significant. We find that antagonism enhances species population growth and reduces the average probability of healthy organisms becoming infected. Additionally, introducing individuals' mobility restrictions significantly decreases both organisms' infection risk and selection pressures. Our results demonstrate that combining mobility restrictions with antagonistic coinfection can increase organisms' life expectancy by up to $54\%$. Our findings show that integrating antagonistic coinfection and mobility restriction strategies into ecological models may provide insights into designing interventions for managing concurrent epidemics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Flow Past an Obstacle in a Quasi-Two-Dimensional Lee-Huang-Yang Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A supersonic flow past an obstacle can generate a rich variety of wave excitations. This paper investigates, both analytically and numerically, two types of excitations generated by the flow of a Lee-Huang-Yang quantum fluid past an obstacle: linear radiation and oblique dark solitons. We show that wave crests of linear radiation can be accurately described by the proper modification of the Kelvin original theory, while the oblique dark soliton solution is obtained analytically by transformation of the 1D soliton solution to the obstacle's reference frame. A comparison between analytical predictions and numerical simulations demonstrates good agreement, validating our theoretical approach.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Almost-Conserved Quantities in Symplectic Maps. Part I: Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noether's theorem, which connects continuous symmetries to exact conservation laws, remains one of the most fundamental principles in physics and dynamical systems. In this work, we draw a conceptual parallel between two paradigms: the emergence of exact invariants from continuous symmetries, and the appearance of approximate invariants from discrete symmetries associated with reversibility in symplectic maps. We demonstrate that by constructing approximating functions that preserve these discrete symmetries order by order, one can systematically uncover hidden structures, closely echoing Noether's framework. The resulting functions serve not only as diagnostic tools but also as compact representations of near-integrable behavior.
  The first article establishes the formal foundations of the method. Using the symmetric form of the map as a flexible test case, we benchmark the perturbative construction against established techniques, including the Lie algebra method for twist coefficients. To resolve the inherent ambiguity in the perturbation series, we introduce an averaging procedure that naturally leads to a resonant theory -- capable of treating rational rotation numbers and small-denominator divergences. This enables an accurate and structured description of low-order resonances, including singular and non-singular features in the quadratic and cubic H\'enon maps. The approach is systematic, requiring only linear algebra and integrals of elementary functions, yet it yields results in striking agreement with both theory and numerical experiment. We conclude by outlining extensions to more general maps and discussing implications for stability estimates in practical systems such as particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Almost-Conserved Quantities in Symplectic Maps. Part II: Recovery of approximate invariant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noether's theorem, which connects continuous symmetries to exact conservation laws, remains one of the most fundamental principles in physics and dynamical systems. In this work, we draw a conceptual parallel between two paradigms: the emergence of exact invariants from continuous symmetries, and the appearance of approximate invariants from discrete symmetries associated with reversibility in symplectic maps. We demonstrate that by constructing approximating functions that preserve these discrete symmetries order by order, one can systematically uncover hidden structures, closely echoing Noether's framework. The resulting functions serve not only as diagnostic tools but also as compact representations of near-integrable behavior.
  The second article applies the method to global dynamics, with a focus on large-amplitude motion and chaotic systems. We demonstrate that the approximate invariants, once averaged, accurately capture the structure of resonances and the boundaries of stability regions. We also explore the recovery of exact invariants in integrable cases, showing that the method reproduces the correct behavior when such structure is present. A single unified function, derived from the map coefficients, yields phase portraits, rotation numbers, and tune footprints that closely match numerical tracking across wide parameter ranges. Comparisons with the Square Matrix method reveal that while both approaches satisfy local constraints, our technique provides greater accuracy and robustness in resonant and strongly nonlinear regimes. These results highlight the method's practical power and broad relevance, offering a compact, analytic framework for organizing nonlinear dynamics in symplectic maps with direct applications to beam physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Almost-Conserved Quantities in Symplectic Maps. Part III: Approximate Invariants in Nonlinear Accelerator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a perturbative method for constructing approximate invariants of motion directly from the equations of discrete-time symplectic systems. This framework offers a natural nonlinear extension of the classic Courant-Snyder (CS) theory -- a foundational cornerstone in accelerator physics now spanning seven decades and historically focused on linear phenomena. The original CS formalism emerged under conditions where nonlinearities were weak, design goals favored linear motion, and analytical tools -- such as the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory -- had not yet been fully developed. While various normal form methods have been proposed to treat near-integrable dynamics, the approach introduced here stands out for its conceptual transparency, minimal computational overhead, and direct applicability to realistic systems. We demonstrate its power and versatility by applying it to several operational accelerator configurations at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FermiLab), illustrating how the method enables fast, interpretable diagnostics of nonlinear behavior across a broad range of machine conditions.</description>

      <title>Quartic soliton solutions of a normal dispersion based mode-locked laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the characteristics, regions of existence and stability of different types of solitons for a distributed model of a mode-locked laser whose dispersion is purely quartic and normal. Among the different types of solitons, we identified three main branches that are named according to their different amplitude: low, medium and high amplitude solitons. It was found that the first solitons are always unstable while the latter two exist and are stable in relatively large regions of the parameter space. Moreover, the stability regions of medium and high amplitude solitons overlap over a certain range of parameters, manifesting effects of bistability. The energy of high amplitude solitons increases quadratically with their width, whereas the energy of medium amplitude solitons may decrease or increase with the width depending on the parameter region. Furthermore, we have investigated the long term evolution of the continuous wave solutions under modulational instability, showing that medium amplitude solitons can arise in this scenario. Additionally, we assessed the effects of second and third order dispersion on medium and high amplitude solitons and found that both remain stable in the presence of these terms.</description>

      <title>Variational Principle for Optical Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: {The problem of laser beam concentration in a focal spot via wavefront variations is formulated as a maximization of the $beam$ $propagation$ $functional$ defined as the light power passing through aperture of an arbitrary shape located in the far field. Variational principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for at least the $local$ $maximum$ of the $beam$ $propagation$ $functional$. The wavefront shape is obtained as exact solution of nonlinear integral equation.}</description>

      <title>Control of the magnetic hopfion lattice in helimagnet with the external field and anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalized micromagnetic model of hopfions in a helimagnet with a two-dimensional (allowing both radial and azimuthal dependence) profile function is considered. Calculations confirm the elliptical stability of hopfions and the previously obtained analytical expression for the upper critical field of their lattice. Dependencies of the hopfion lattice periods on the magnitude of the applied external magnetic field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant of the material are obtained. It is shown that in an anisotropic helimagnet, the hopfion lattice expands in the direction of the anisotropy axis, and the expansion can be controlled by the external field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant.</description>
