      <title>A stochastic approach to time-dependent BEC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic description of the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate within the context of Nelson stochastic mechanics. We start from the $N$ interacting conservative diffusions, associated with the $N$ Bose particles, and take an infinite particle limit. We address several aspects of this formulation. First, we consider the problem of extending to a system with self-interaction the variational formulation of Nelson stochastic mechanics due to Guerra and Morato. In this regard we discuss two possible extensions, one based on a doubling procedure and another based on a constraint Eulerian type variational principle. Then we consider the infinite particle limit from the point of view of the $N$-particles Madelung equations. Since conservative diffusions can be identified with proper infinitesimal characteristics pairs $(\rho_N(t), v_N(t))$, a time marginal probability density and a current velocity field, respectively, we consider a finite Madelung hierarchy for the marginals pairs $(\rho_{N,n}(t), v_{N,n}(t))$, obtained by properly conditioning the processes. The infinite Madelung hierarchy arises from the finite one by performing, for each fixed $n$, a mean-field scaling limit in $N$. Finally, we introduce a $n$-particle conditioned diffusions which naturally parallels the quantum mechanical approach and is a new approach within the context of Nelson stochastic mechanics. We then prove the convergence, in the infinite particle limit, of the law of such a conditioned process to the law of a self-interacting diffusion which describes the condensate.</description>

      <title>Perturbed infinite-state Markov systems with holes and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a perturbed system $(X,\varphi(\epsilon,\cdot))$, where $X$ is a topological Markov shift with a countably infinite state space, and $\varphi(\epsilon,\cdot)$ is a real-valued potential on X depending on a small parameter $\epsilon\in (0,1)$. We assume that for each $\epsilon&gt;0$, the system has a unique transitive component and a unique Gibbs measure (or more generally, a Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius (RPF) measure) $\mu_{\epsilon}$, while the unperturbed system possesses multiple transitive components and Gibbs measures on these components. We investigate the convergence of the measure $\mu_{\epsilon}$ as $\epsilon\to 0$ and the representation of the limiting measure, if it exists. In previous work [T. 2020], we considered the finite state case. Our approach relies on a development of the Schur-Frobenius factorization theorem, which we apply to demonstrate a spectral gap property for Perron complements of Ruelle operators in the infinite-state case. As an application, we examine perturbed piecewise expanding Markov maps with holes, defined over countably infinite partitions. We investigate the splitting behavior of the associated Gibbs measure under perturbation.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Anderson Model in the Hyperbolic Space. Part I: Annealed Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the second-order moment asymptotics for a parabolic Anderson model $\partial_{t}u=(\Delta+\xi)u$ in the hyperbolic space with a regular, stationary Gaussian potential $\xi$. It turns out that the growth and fluctuation asymptotics both are identical to the Euclidean situation. As a result, the solution exhibits the same moment intermittency property as in the Euclidean case. An interesting point here is that the fluctuation exponent is determined by a variational problem induced by the Euclidean (rather than hyperbolic) Laplacian. Heuristically, this is due to a curvature dilation effect: the geometry becomes asymptotically flat after suitable renormalisation in the derivation of the second-order asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Anderson Model in the Hyperbolic Space. Part II: Quenched Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the exact quenched asymptotic growth of the solution to the parabolic Anderson model (PAM) in the hyperbolic space with a regular, stationary, time-independent Gaussian potential. More precisely, we show that with probability one, the solution $u$ to PAM with constant initial data has pointwise growth asymptotics \[ u(t,x)\sim e^{L^{*}t^{5/3}+o(t^{5/3})} \] as $t \rightarrow +\infty$. Both the power $t^{5/3}$ on the exponential and the exact value of $L^*$ are different from their counterparts in the Euclidean situation. They are determined through an explicit optimisation procedure. Our proof relies on certain fine localisation techniques, which also reveals a stronger non-Euclidean localisation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Maximal Counts in the Stopped Occupancy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a version of the classic occupancy scheme, where balls are thrown until almost all boxes receive a given number of balls. Special cases are widely known as coupon-collectors and dixie cup problems. We show that as the number of boxes tends to infinity, the distribution of the maximal occupancy count does not converge, but can be approximated by a convolution of two Gumbel distributions, with the approximating distribution having oscillations close to periodic on a logarithmic scale. We pursue two approaches: one relies on lattice point processes obtained by poissonisation of the number of balls and boxes, and the other employs interpolation of the multiset of occupancy counts to a point process on reals. This way we gain considerable insight in known asymptotics obtained previously by mostly analytic tools. Further results concern the moments of maximal occupancy counts and ties for the maximum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze pivot probabilities in Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) for $2 \times 2$ random matrix ensembles. For GUE matrices, we resolve a previously reported discrepancy between theoretical predictions and empirical observations by deriving the exact pivot probability under standard LAPACK-style implementations. We further show that Dumitriu-Edelman tridiagonal $\beta$-ensembles agree with the earlier theoretical expectations. Finally, we propose an open question on pivot behavior under alternative norm choices, supported by empirical evidence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a framework for weak and strong convergence of matrix models to operator-valued semicircular systems parametrized by operator-valued covariance matrices $\eta = (\eta_{i,j})_{i,j \in I}$. Non-commutative polynomials are replaced by covariance polynomials that can involve iterated applications of $\eta_{i,j}$, leading to the notion of covariance laws. We give sufficient conditions for weak and strong convergence of general Gaussian random matrices and deterministic matrices to a $B$-valued semicircular family and generators of the base algebra $B$. In particular, we obtain operator-valued strong convergence for continuously weighted Gaussian Wigner matrices, such as Gaussian band matrices with a continuous cutoff, and we construct natural strongly convergent matrix models for interpolated free group factors.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Dynamic Factor Modeling via Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven dynamic factor framework where a response variable depends on a high-dimensional set of covariates, without imposing any parametric model on the joint dynamics. Leveraging Anisotropic Diffusion Maps, a nonlinear manifold learning technique introduced by Singer and Coifman, our framework uncovers the joint dynamics of the covariates and responses in a purely data-driven way. We approximate the embedding dynamics using linear diffusions, and exploit Kalman filtering to predict the evolution of the covariates and response variables directly from the diffusion map embedding space. We generalize Singer's convergence rate analysis of the graph Laplacian from the case of independent uniform samples on a compact manifold to the case of time series arising from Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space. Furthermore, we provide rigorous justification for our procedure by showing the robustness of approximations of the diffusion map coordinates by linear diffusions, and the convergence of ergodic averages under standard spectral assumptions on the underlying dynamics. We apply our method to the stress testing of equity portfolios using a combination of financial and macroeconomic factors from the Federal Reserve's supervisory scenarios. We demonstrate that our data-driven stress testing method outperforms standard scenario analysis and Principal Component Analysis benchmarks through historical backtests spanning three major financial crises, achieving reductions in mean absolute error of up to 55% and 39% for scenario-based portfolio return prediction, respectively.</description>

      <title>On sharp stable recovery from clipped and folded measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of vector recovery from random linear measurements which have been either clipped or folded. This is motivated by applications where measurement devices detect inputs outside of their effective range.
  As examples of our main results, we prove sharp lower bounds on the recovery constant for both the declipping and unfolding problems whenever samples are taken according to a uniform distribution on the sphere. Moreover, we show such estimates under (almost) the best possible conditions on both the number of samples and the distribution of the data. We then prove that all of the above results have suitable (effectively) sparse counterparts. In the special case that one restricts the stability analysis to vectors which belong to the unit sphere of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we show that the problem of declipping directly extends the one-bit compressed sensing results of Oymak-Recht and Plan-Vershynin.</description>

      <title>Robust estimation of a Markov chain transition matrix from multiple sample paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chains are fundamental models for stochastic dynamics, with applications in a wide range of areas such as population dynamics, queueing systems, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo methods. Estimating the transition matrix and stationary distribution from observed sample paths is a core statistical challenge, particularly when multiple independent trajectories are available. While classical theory typically assumes identical chains with known stationary distributions, real-world data often arise from heterogeneous chains whose transition kernels and stationary measures might differ from a common target. We analyse empirical estimators for such parallel Markov processes and establish sharp concentration inequalities that generalise Bernstein-type bounds from standard time averages to ensemble-time averages. Our results provide nonasymptotic error bounds and consistency guarantees in high-dimensional regimes, accommodating sparse or weakly mixing chains, model mismatch, nonstationary initialisations, and partially corrupted data. These findings offer rigorous foundations for statistical inference in heterogeneous Markov chain settings common in modern computational applications.</description>

      <title>Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation. Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach over diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Subcritical Boolean percolation on graphs of bounded degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a model of long-range site percolation on graphs of bounded degree, namely the Boolean percolation model. In this model, each vertex of an infinite connected graph is the center of a ball of random radius, and vertices are said to be active independently with probability $p \in [0, 1]$. We consider $W$ to be the reunion of random balls with an active center. In certain circumstances, the model does not exhibit a phase transition, in the sense that $W$ almost surely contains an infinite component for all $p &gt; 0$, or even $W$ covers the entire graph. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition on the radius distribution for the existence of a subcritical phase, namely a regime such that almost surely all the connected components of $W$ are finite. Additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for the exponential decay of the size of a typical component.</description>

Abstract: We continue our work [arXiv:2403.07628] on asymptotic expansions at the soft edge for the classical $n$-dimensional Gaussian and Laguerre random matrix ensembles. By revisiting the construction of the associated skew-orthogonal polynomials in terms of wave functions, we obtain concise expressions for the level densities that are well suited for proving asymptotic expansions in powers of a certain parameter $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$. In the unitary case, the expansion for the level density can be used to reconstruct the first correction term in an established asymptotic expansion of the associated generating function. In the orthogonal and symplectic cases, we can even reconstruct the conjectured first and second correction terms.</description>

      <title>Symmetric splitting of one-dimensional noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetric random walk $X$ whose jumps have diffuse law, looked at up to an independent geometric random time, splits at the minimum into two independent and identically distributed pieces. The same for the maximum. It is natural to ask, are there any other times adapted to $X$ exhibiting this "symmetric splitting"? It appears that the phenomenon is most conveniently couched in terms of (what may be called) the noise structure of $X$. At the level of generality of the latter, an equivalent set-theoretic condition for the symmetric splitting property is provided, leading to the observation that the answer to the elucidated question is to the affirmative. While we do not deal much with the obvious analog of the phenomenon in continuous time, the discrete findings do beg the question: does linear Brownian motion admit times of symmetric splitting other than the maxima and minima? This is left unresolved, but we do make some comments as to why it may be non-trivial/interesting.</description>

      <title>Linear short rate model with several delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a short rate model in continuous time that adds one or more memory (delay) components to the Merton model (Merton 1970, 1973) or the Vasi\v{c}ek model (Vasi\v{c}ek 1977) for the short rate. The distribution of the short rate in this model is normal, with the mean depending on past values of the short rate, and a limiting distribution exists for certain values of the parameters. The zero coupon bond price is an affine function of the short rate, whose coefficients satisfy a system of delay differential equations. This system can be solved analytically, obtaining a closed formula. An analytical expression for the instantaneous forward rate is given: it satisfies the risk neutral dynamics of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton model. Formulae for both forward looking and backward looking caplets on overnight risk free rates are presented.

      <title>Finite-time horizon, stopper vs. singular-controller games on the half-line</title>

Abstract: We prove existence of a value for two-player zero-sum stopper vs. singular-controller games on finite-time horizon, when the underlying dynamics is one-dimensional, diffusive and bound to evolve in $[0,\infty)$. We show that the value is the maximal solution of a variational inequality with both obstacle and gradient constraint and satisfying a Dirichlet boundary condition at $[0,T)\times\{0\}$. Moreover, we obtain an optimal strategy for the stopper. In order to achieve our goals, we rely on new probabilistic methods, yielding gradient bounds and equi-continuity for the solutions of penalised partial differential equations that approximate the variational inequality.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Algorithms using Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interface between stochastic analysis and machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, with path signatures - iterated integrals that provide faithful, hierarchical representations of paths - offering a principled and universal feature map for sequential and structured data. Rooted in rough path theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling - common challenges in real-world time series and graph data.
  This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency, bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling; the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context length.
  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.</description>
