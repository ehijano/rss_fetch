      <title>The impact of glasma on heavy flavor azimuthal correlations and spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenological impact of the pre-equilibrium glasma initial stage of heavy-ion collisions on heavy quark azimuthal correlations and spectra. Using our numerical solver, we simulate the transport of heavy quark test particles in an SU(3) glasma background field. The glasma field equations are formulated using classical real-time lattice gauge theory, and the heavy quark dynamics are described by classical transport equations numerically solved using the colored particle-in-cell method. For the first time, the effect of the glasma stage on the azimuthal correlations of $c\overline{c}$ and $b\overline{b}$ pairs is studied. The resulting azimuthal width $\sigma_{\Delta\phi}$ exhibits a large and quick decorrelation due to the strong glasma fields. Further, we evaluate how the $p_T$-broadening in the glasma affects heavy quark $p_T$-spectra, which are initialized according to the FONLL heavy quark production calculation. The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is extracted for $c$ and $b$ quarks in the glasma and additional nuclear PDF effects accounting for gluon shadowing are included.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavor angular correlations as a direct probe of the glasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use classical equations of motion for heavy quarks to show that the pre-equilibrium glasma phase of a heavy ion collision has an extremely strong effect on heavy quark angular correlations. At the same time, the effect on the single inclusive spectrum is much more moderate. This suggests that $D\overline{D}$ meson angular correlations in future LHC measurements could provide direct experimental access to the physics of the pre-equilibrium stage.</description>

      <title>Nuclear-level effective theory of $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion: Inelastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mu2e and COMET will search for electrons produced via the neutrinoless conversion of stopped muons bound in 1s atomic orbits of $^{27}$Al, improving existing limits on charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) by roughly four orders of magnitude. Conventionally, $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion experiments are optimized to detect electrons originating from transitions where the nucleus remains in the ground state, thereby maximizing the energy of the outgoing electron. Clearly, detection of a positive signal in forthcoming experiments would stimulate additional work $-$ including subsequent conversion experiments using complementary nuclear targets $-$ to further constrain the new physics responsible for CLFV. Here we argue that additional information can be extracted without the need for additional experiments, by considering inelastic conversion in $^{27}$Al. Transitions to low-lying nuclear excited states can modify the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, with the ratio of the elastic and inelastic responses being sensitive to the underlying CLFV operator. We extend the nuclear effective theory of $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion to the inelastic case, which adds five new response functions to the six that arise for the elastic process. We evaluate these nuclear response functions in $^{27}$Al and calculate the resulting conversion-electron signal, taking into account the resolution anticipated in Mu2e/COMET. We find that $^{27}$Al is an excellent target choice from the perspective of the new information that can be obtained from inelastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion.</description>

      <title>Status of tension between NO$\nu$A and T2K after Neutrino 2024 and possible role of non-standard neutrino interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work we have shown that the data presented by the two long-baseline accelerator experiments NO$\nu$A and T2K at the Neutrino 2020 conference displayed a tension, and that it could be alleviated by non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) of the flavor changing type involving the $e-\mu$ or the $e-\tau$ sectors with couplings $|\varepsilon_{e\mu}| \sim |\varepsilon_{e\tau}|\sim 0.1$. As a consequence a hint in favor of NSI emerged. In the present paper we reassess the issue in light of the new data released by the two experiments at the Neutrino 2024 conference. We find that the tension in the determination of the standard CP-phase $\delta_{\mathrm {CP}}$ extracted by the two experiments in the normal neutrino mass ordering persists and has a statistical significance of $\sim2\sigma$. Concerning the NSI, we find that including their effects in the fit, the two values of $\delta_{\mathrm {CP}}$ preferred by NO$\nu$A and T2K return in very good agreement. The current statistical significance of the hint of non zero NSI is $\sim1.8\sigma$. Further experimental data are needed in order to settle the issue.</description>

      <title>Is the real two-Higgs-doublet model consistent?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide strong evidence that the widely-studied real two-Higgs-doublet model is inconsistent under renormalization due to quark-induced divergent CP violation (CPV). We identify the necessary ingredients for the CPV to enter the renormalization-group equations based on symmetry proprieties of the divergent diagrams. We demonstrate that while these ingredients are present starting at six loops, the divergent CPV is zero at that order due to approximate symmetries. We show that these symmetries are broken at seven loops and determine the parameter dependence of the resulting divergent CPV.</description>

      <title>Gravitational chargegenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wash-in leptogenesis is an attractive mechanism to produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. It treats right-handed-neutrino interactions as spectator processes, on the same footing as electroweak sphalerons, that reprocess primordial charge asymmetries in the thermal plasma into a baryon-minus-lepton asymmetry. The origin of these primordial charges must be accounted for by new $CP$-violating dynamics at very high energies. In this paper, we propose such a scenario of chargegenesis that, unlike earlier proposals, primarily relies on new interactions in the gravitational sector. We point out that a coupling of a conserved current to the divergence of the Ricci scalar during reheating can lead to nonzero effective chemical potentials in the plasma that, together with a suitable charge-violating interaction, can result in the production of a primordial charge asymmetry. Gravitational chargegenesis represents a substantial generalization of the idea of gravitational baryogenesis. We provide a detailed analysis of a generic and minimal realization that is consistent with inflation and show that it can successfully explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Neutron Tagging Can Greatly Reduce Spallation Backgrounds in Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Kamiokande's spallation backgrounds - the delayed beta decays of nuclides following cosmic-ray muons - are nearly all produced by the small fraction of muons with hadronic showers. We show that these hadronic showers also produce neutrons; their captures can be detected with high efficiency due to the recent addition of dissolved gadolinium to Super-Kamiokande. We show that new cuts based on the neutron tagging of showers could reduce spallation backgrounds by a factor of at least four beyond present cuts. With further work, this could lead to a near-elimination of detector backgrounds above about 6 MeV, which would significantly improve the sensitivity of Super-Kamiokande. These findings heighten the importance of adding gadolinium to Hyper-Kamiokande, which is at a shallower depth. Further, a similar approach could be used in other detectors, for example, the JUNO liquid-scintillator detector, which is also at a shallower depth.</description>

      <title>The Juno Mission as a Probe of Long-Range New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbits of celestial objects, especially the geocentric and heliocentric ones, have been well explored to constrain new long-range forces beyond the Standard Model (SM), often referred to as fifth forces. In this paper, for the first time, we apply the motion of a spacecraft around Jupiter to probe fifth forces that don't violate the equivalence principle. The spacecraft is the Juno orbiter, and ten of its early orbits already allow a precise determination of the Jovian gravitational field. We use the shift in the precession angle as a proxy to test non-gravitational interactions between Juno and Jupiter. Requiring that the contribution from the fifth force does not exceed the uncertainty of the precession shift inferred from data, we find that a new parameter space with the mass of the fifth-force mediator around $10^{-14}$ eV is excluded at 95% C.L.</description>

      <title>Probing neutrino millicharges at the European Spallation Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the potential of a set of future detectors, proposed to be located at the European Spallation Source (ESS), to probe neutrino millicharges through coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. In particular, we focus on detectors with similar characteristics as those that are under development for operation at the ESS, including detection technologies based on cesium iodine, germanium, and noble gases. Under the considered conditions, we show that the Ge detector, with a lighter nuclear target mass with respect to CsI and to a noble gas like Xe, is more efficient to constrain neutrino millicharges, reaching a sensitivity of $\sim 10^{-9}e$ for diagonal neutrino millicharges, and $\sim 10^{-8}e$ for the transition ones. In addition, we study the effects of including electron scattering processes for the CsI detector, achieving an expected sensitivity of $\sim 10^{-10} e$ for the diagonal millicharges.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Probes of Higgs-Axion non-perturbative Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the phenomenological implications of several non-trivial axion-Higgs couplings, which cover most of the possible non-perturbative scenarios. Specifically we consider the combination of having higher order non-renormalizable Higgs-axion couplings originating from a weakly coupled effective theory combined with non-perturbative couplings of the form $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$. Since we consider the misalignment axion, the non-perturbative couplings can be expanded in the form of a perturbation expansion in powers of $\phi/f_a$, thus after the electroweak symmetry breaking, the effective potential of the axion is drastically affected by these terms. We investigate the phenomenological implications of these terms for various values of the mass scale $\Lambda_c$, and some scenarios are theoretically disfavored, while other scenarios with non-perturbative Higgs-axion couplings of the form $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$ with $\Lambda_c\sim 10^{-10}\times m_a$ and $m_a\sim 10^{-10}\,$eV, lead to a characteristic pattern in the stochastic gravitational wave background via the deformation of the background equation of state parameter occurring at frequencies probed by the Einstein Telescope. We also consider loop effects from the Higgs sector caused by the term $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$ if we close the Higgs in one loop.</description>

      <title>The higher $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$, $h_c(nP)$ states and the role of the gluon-exchange potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The masses, the fine-structure splitting, and two-photon decay widths of the higher $nP$-charmonium states are calculated in the relativistic string model, reduced to the spinless Salpeter equation, where the static potential has no fitting parameters and the $c-$quark mass has the physical value. The resulting masses of $h_c(3P)$, $\chi_{c1}(3P)$, $\chi_{c0}(4P)$, $\chi_{c0}(5P)$, $\chi_{c1}(5P)$ are obtained in a good agreement with the experimental masses of the LHCb resonances: $h_c(4300)$, $\chi_{c1}(4274)$, $X(4500)$, $X(4700)$, $X(4685)$. To test sensitivity of results to a chosen gluon-exchange (GE) potential, three types of $V_{ge}(r)$ are considered. In first case the non-screened GE potential with large vector coupling at asymptotic, $\alpha_{\rm V}(\rm asym.)=0.635$, and the $c$-quark mass $m_c=1.430$ GeV are taken; in second case a screened $V_{ge}$ and $m_c=1.385$ are investigated, and in third case the GE potential is totally suppressed, $V_{ge}=0$, and $m_c=1.32$ GeV. The agreement with experiment is reached only if the same (universal) flattened confining potential, introduced in the analysis of the radial Regge trajectories of light mesons, is used. The unobserved $6P,0^+$ resonance with the mass $\cong 4.81$ GeV, near $J/\psi\phi(1680)$ threshold, is predicted. Our analysis shows that the screening of the GE potential is possible but weakly affects the physical results obtained. The calculated two-photon decay widths weakly differ in the three cases but may become an important factor, which distinguishes $c\bar c$ and four-quark states.</description>

      <title>A Three-Coupled-Channel Analysis of $Z_c(3900)$ Involving $D\bar{D}^*$, $\pi J/\psi$, and $\rho \eta_c $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a three-coupled-channel analysis of the $Z_c(3900)$ structure, focusing on the $D\bar{D}^*$, $J/\psi \pi$, and $\rho \eta_c$ channels, based on the one-boson exchange model. Drawing from previous study on the exotic state $T_{cc}$, we only utilize one more parameter to construct the interactions between the channels. Our model successfully reproduces the experimental line shapes of the invariant mass distribution at $\sqrt{s} = 4.23$ and $4.26$ GeV for the three channels. Additionally, the finite-volume energy levels in our model show agreement with current LQCD conclusion. Detailed analysis suggests that the $Z_c(3900)$ peaks in the $\pi J/\psi$ and $\rho \eta_c$ distributions primarily arise from the triangle loop involving the $D_1 \bar{D} D^*$ intermediate system. In the $D\bar{D}^*$ distribution, the threshold peak is generated by the cascade decay mechanism enhanced by a triangle diagram. Moreover, we find a virtual pole located far from the threshold, indicating that $Z_c(3900)$ peaks are not associated with physical pole. We conclude that the $Z_c(3900)$ peaks are predominantly caused by the threshold cusp.</description>

      <title>Lepton seesaw model in a modular $A_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a lepton seesaw model to get the same mass-origin of charged-leptons and neutrinos introducing a modular $A_4$ symmetry. In this scenario, the mass matrix of charged-leptons is induced via seesaw-like mechanism while the mass matrix of neutrino is realized via an inverse seesaw mechanism with help of vector-like fermions and an isospin singlet and triplet scalar field with nonzero vacuum expectation values. In analyzing the model we concentrate on fixed points of modulus $\tau$ that is favored by a flux compactification of Type IIB string theory. We search for allowed region at nearby these fixed points and find good solutions at nearby $\tau=\omega$ with several good predictions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of gluon plasma: A q-potential approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the thermodynamic properties of quark-gluon plasma using Kramer's $q-potential$ method. We propose a modification in the first law of thermodynamics by including a temperature-dependent term when single particle energies themselves are temperature-dependent. With this modified first law, we derive an expression for pressure starting from Kramer's $q-potential$. We find that to maintain thermodynamic consistency, pressure receives an additional term solely due to medium-dependent dispersion relation. The energy density, by definition, remains a sum over all the single-particle energies with an appropriate weight factor. We confront this quasiparticle model with the lattice QCD data of SU(3) pure gluon plasma.</description>

Abstract: We present the high-precision result for the zero-jettiness soft function at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) in perturbative QCD. At this perturbative order, the soft function is the last missing ingredient required for the computation of a hadronic colour singlet production or a colour singlet decay into two jets using the zero-jettiness variable as the slicing parameter. Furthermore, the knowledge of the N3LO soft function enables the re-summed description of the thrust distribution in the process $e^+ e^- \to \textrm{hadrons}$ through next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order, which is important for the extraction of the strong coupling constant using this shape variable. On the methodological side, the complexity of the zero-jettiness variable forced us to develop a new semi-analytic method for phase-space integration in the presence of constraints parameterized through Heaviside functions which, hopefully, will be useful for further development of the $N$-jettiness slicing scheme.</description>

      <title>Spin kinetic theory with a nonlocal relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel relaxation time approximation for kinetic theory with spin which takes into account the nonlocality of particle collisions. In particular, it models the property of the microscopic nonlocal collision term to vanish in global, but not in local equilibrium. We study the asymptotic distribution function obtained as the solution of the Boltzmann equation within the nonlocal relaxation time approximation in the limit of small gradients and short relaxation time. We show that the resulting polarization agrees with the one obtained from the Zubarev formalism for a certain value of a coefficient that determines the time scale on which orbital angular momentum is converted into spin. This coefficient can be identified with a parameter related to the pseudo gauge choice in the Zubarev formalism. Finally, we demonstrate how the nonlocal collision term generates polarization from vorticity by studying a nonrelativistic rotating cylinder both from kinetic and hydrodynamic approaches, which are shown to be equivalent in this example.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of vector portal mediators, dark photons, with masses in the range 0.4--1.8\,GeV in proton-proton collisions via the process of inelastic proton bremsstrahlung. In contrast to previous studies, we take into account the contribution of Pauli electromagnetic form factor to differential cross section and introduce two new splitting functions of the proton. We show that their contributions can become leading in the mass region 0.9--1.8\,GeV and present the updated estimate for the sensitivity of the future SHiP experiment to visible decays of dark photons.</description>

      <title>Searches for long-lived dark photons at proton accelerator experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic and unified study of the ability of lifetime frontier experiments to explore the parameter space of hypothetical long-lived particles is one of the main steps in defining their parameter space. Such an analysis has not been conducted for dark photons -- hypothetical massive particles that have kinetic mixing with Standard Model photons. Existing studies have varied in their assumptions about dark photon phenomenology, often using outdated models that do not reflect recent advancements. In this paper, we present a unified calculation of the parameter space for GeV-scale dark photons probed by lifetime frontier experiments, delineating the regions excluded by past experiments and those accessible to future experiments. Our approach incorporates the latest advances in studying dark photon production mechanisms, including proton bremsstrahlung and mixing with neutral mesons, and utilizes the full palette of hadronic decays. Additionally, we explore the impact of uncertainties in proton bremsstrahlung on the dark photon parameter space, and find that they may severely affect the reach of many past and future experiments, including the maximal probed mass. The results are provided in a publicly accessible format, specifically through the implementation of the updated phenomenological models in \texttt{SensCalc} - a unified tool for calculating event rates of new physics particles at lifetime frontier experiments, that has been supplemented by the module \texttt{EventCalc} that samples events similar to traditional Monte Carlo generators.</description>

      <title>Capability of Cosmic Gravitational Focusing on Identifying the Neutrino Mass Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) of relic neutrinos can provide an independent measurement of the absolute neutrino masses $m_i$ with fourth-power dependence ($m^4_i$). We demonstrate in this paper for the first time how this can help identifying the neutrino mass ordering (NMO). Upon incorporating the projected CGF sensitivity at DESI, the preference for the normal ordering (NO) with a prior $\sum m_\nu &gt; 0.509\,{\rm eV}$ would increase from the original 89.9\% of the current clustering method with both DESI BAO and CMB to 98.2\% while the inverted ordering (IO) is further disfavored from 10.1\% to 1.8\%. We also show how this can affect the prospects of the neutrinoless double beta decay and single beta decay measurements.</description>

Abstract: We have shown that the relationship between the DIS structure functions is stable for a nuclear target with mass number A at $x{\leq}10^{-3}$. Numerical results are provided for the specific nuclei 12C and 208Pb using the nuclear PDF parameterizations implemented in the HIJING2.0 model. These results fall whithin the EIC kinematic acceptance for heavy ion running. The ratio $R^{A}_{F_{L}}$ is calculated as the ratio $R^{A}_{F_{2}}$ in the HIJING2.0 model.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Timelike Compton scattering in photon-proton interactions at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information about the 3-dimensional description of the quark and gluon content of hadrons, described by the generalized parton distributions (GPDs), can be probed by exclusive processes in electron - proton ($ep$) collisions. In this letter, we investigate the timelike Compton scattering (TCS) in $ep$ collisions at the future electron - ion collider (EIC). Such process is characterized by the exclusive dilepton production through the subprocess $\gamma p \rightarrow \gamma^*p \rightarrow l^+ l^- p$, with the real photon in the initial state being emitted by the incoming electron. Assuming a given model for the GPDs, the TCS differential cross-section is estimated, as well the contribution associated to the interference between the TCS and Bethe - Heitler (BH) amplitudes. Predictions for the TCS, BH and interference contributions are presented considering the kinematical range expected to be covered by the EIC detectors. Moreover, the polarized photon asymmetry is also studied. Our results indicated that a future experimental analysis, considering photon circular polarizations, can be useful to probe the interference contribution and constrain the description of the GPDs for the proton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dark sector with a very large number of massive degrees of freedom is generically constrained by radiative corrections to Newton's constant. However, there are caveats to this statement, especially if the degrees of freedom are light or mass-less. Here, we examine in detail and update a number of constraints on the possible number of dark degrees of freedom, including from black hole evaporation, from perturbations to systems including an evaporating black hole, from direct gravitational production at colliders, from high-energy cosmic rays, and from supernovae energy losses.</description>

      <title>Hidden strangeness in meson weak decays to baryon pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weak decays of heavy mesons into baryon pairs, focusing on channels dominated by annihilation-type diagrams, where short-distance (SD) contributions are highly suppressed. We focus on decays with small energy release to further ensure the dominance of long-distance (LD) physics. The final state interactions of the triangular diagrams do not require a cutoff, making our numerical results reliable. Moreover, the hidden strangeness in the intermediate state naturally avoids chiral suppression. The branching fractions are predicted to be ${\cal B}(D_s^+ \to p\overline{n}) = (1.43 \pm 0.10 ) \times 10^{-3}$ and ${\cal B} (B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-) &gt; 4.7 \times 10^{-5}$, respectively. The former is in agreement with the experimental data of $(1.22 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{-3}$, while the latter suggests that a measurement is now feasible. Using the experimental upper bound of ${\cal B} (B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-) &lt; 8 \times 10^{-5}$, we set a constraint on the coupling constant $g_{D^+ \Lambda_c^+ n} &lt; 7.5$. The CP symmetry suggests that $B_{sH/L}^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-$ is dominated by $P/S$ wave. This selection rule distinguishes the SD and LD contributions, allowing experiments to further test our understanding in the nonperturbative region. We propose future measurements on $B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-$ to test final state interaction mechanisms, predicting significant $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects with ${\cal B}(B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-) / {\cal B} (B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-) = 1.4\%$, contrary to the naive estimate of $5.3\%$.</description>

      <title>Pauli form factor contributions to the inelastic proton bremsstrahlung and dark photon production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of hypothetical vector particles, dark photons $\gamma^\prime$, with masses in the the range 0.4--1.8 GeV via inelastic proton bremsstrahlung. We further develop the approach of Refs. [1-3], where for the first time we considered the contributions to the cross section that are associated with the Pauli form factor in $pp\gamma^\prime$ vertex and obtained new splitting functions. We demonstrate numerically the importance of these corrections to full inelastic proton bremsstrahlung cross section and refine the sensitivity of the ongoing and future fixed target experiments T2K, DUNE and SHiP to the parameters of dark photon model. A dedicated experiment on measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region below the proton-antiproton threshold, like those suggested in PANDA at FAIR, would help to obtain the robust predictions for the dark photon production by a proton beam at fixed target.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from High Temperature Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13803v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite temperature effects in string cosmology and their potential gravitational wave signature. Expanding on our recent work arXiv:2310.11494 , we consider a general configuration of highly excited open and closed strings at high enough temperature to be in the Hagedorn phase in 3+1 dimensions, in order to explore its cosmological implications. We find conditions, which can be satisfied in compactifications with moduli stabilization, that allow the long strings to remain in equilibrium in a controlled effective field theory, with equilibration driven by the joining and splitting of the dominant open string population. We calculate the emission rate of gravitons by long open strings, which we show is determined by ten dimensional flat space transition amplitudes available in the literature, and then find the total gravitational wave spectrum generated by the gas of long strings. The gravitational wave spectrum has robust characteristics. It peaks at frequencies of order 50-100 GHz, the same as for gravitational waves from the reheating epoch of the Standard Model. But the amplitude of the string signal is significantly larger than predicted by the Standard Model and its field theoretic extensions. The amplitude and other physical observables (such as the contribution to $\Delta N_{\text eff}$) are directly proportional to the string scale $M_s$; indicating that a potential signal may also determine the string scale. Our calculations provide one of the few examples of a signal of stringy origin that dominates over the field theory predictions. We give a physical explanation of our results and discuss further implications.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity Beyond the Scalar Sector: A Search for Tensor and Mixed Tensor-Scalar Bispectra with Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves could be non-Gaussian, just like primordial scalar perturbations. Although the tensor two-point function has thus-far remained elusive, the three-point function could, in principle, be large enough to be detected in Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies. We perform a detailed analysis of tensor and mixed tensor-scalar non-Gaussianity through the Planck PR4 bispectrum, placing constraints on eleven primordial templates, spanning various phenomenological and physical regimes including modifications to gravity, additional fields in inflation, and primordial magnetic fields. All analysis is performed using modern quasi-optimal binned estimators, and yields no evidence for tensor non-Gaussianity, with a maximum detection significance of $1.8\sigma$. Our constraints are derived primarily from large-scales (except for tensor-scalar-scalar models), and benefit greatly from the inclusion of $B$-modes. Although we find some loss of information from binning, mask effects and residual foreground contamination, our $f_{\rm NL}$ bounds improve over those of previous analyses by $40-600\%$, with six of the eleven models being analyzed for the first time. Unlike for scalar non-Gaussianity, future low-noise experiments such as LiteBIRD, the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will yield considerable improvement in tensor non-Gaussianity constraints.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: cosmological parameters and the structure growth anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors, which is the simplest approach to galaxy clustering data analysis that combines effective field theory (EFT) on large scales and numerical simulations on small scales. The core ingredient of our approach is the prior density of EFT parameters which we extract from a suite of 10500 galaxy simulations based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model. We measure the EFT parameters with the field-level forward model, which enables us to cancel cosmic variance. On the theory side, we develop a new efficient approach to calculate field-level transfer functions using time-sliced perturbation theory and the logarithmic fast Fourier transform. We study cosmology dependence of EFT parameters of dark matter halos and HOD galaxies and find that it can be ignored for the purpose of prior generation. We use neural density estimation to model the measured distribution of EFT parameters. Our distribution model is then used as a prior in a reanalysis of the BOSS full-shape galaxy power spectrum data. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find significant ($\approx 30\%$ and $\approx 60\%$) improvements for the matter density fraction and the mass fluctuation amplitude, which are constrained to $\Omega_m= 0.315 \pm 0.010$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.671 \pm 0.027$. The value of the Hubble constant does not change, $H_0= 68.7\pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc. This reaffirms earlier reports of the structure growth tension from the BOSS data. Finally, we use the measured EFT parameters to constrain galaxy formation physics.</description>

      <title>SpectrAx: Spectral Search of Axion-Like Particles Using Multi-Band Observations of Galaxy Clusters from SKA, SO, CMB-S4 and eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of axions or Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) has been predicted by various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories, and the proposed photon-ALP interaction is one of the ways to probe them. Such an interaction will lead to photon-ALP resonant conversion in galaxy clusters, resulting in a polarized spectral distortion in the CMB along the cluster line of sight. The estimation of this signal from galaxy clusters requires an estimation of the electron density and magnetic field in galaxy clusters. We have developed a new Bayesian framework \texttt{SpectrAx} that can use observations from different electromagnetic bands such as radio, CMB, optical, and X-ray to infer the astrophysical properties of a galaxy cluster, such as cluster its redshift, electron density and magnetic field, along with the BSM physics such as ALPs. By using the simulated data for upcoming CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 in combination with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) we demonstrate the capability in accurately inferring the ALPs coupling strength along with the radial profile of electron density and magnetic field from galaxy clusters. The application of this framework to the data from future surveys by combining SKA+SO+eROSITA and SKA+CMB-S4+eROSITA will make it possible for the first time to explore both astrophysics and BSM physics from low-redshift galaxy clusters using a multi-band approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on our ongoing lattice QCD computation of antistatic-antistatic potentials in the presence of two light quarks using the CLS $N_f=2$ gauge configurations and the OpenQ*D codebase. We utilize a set of 16 creation operators, corresponding to 8 sectors characterized by angular momentum and parity quantum numbers for light quarks $qq = (ud - du) / \sqrt{2}$ (isospin $0$), $qq \in \{ uu , (ud + du) / \sqrt{2}, dd \}$ (isospin $1$) and $qq \in \{ us , ds \}$ (isospin $1/2$ and strangeness $-1$). We improve on previous work by considering a large number of off-axis separations of the static antiquarks and by using tree-level improvement. The resulting potentials provide vague indication for one-pion exchange at $\bar Q \bar Q$ separations $r \gtrapprox$ 0.5 fm.</description>

      <title>Probing dark-matter effects with gravitational waves using the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A massive black hole can develop a dark-matter overdensity, and the dark matter changes the evolution of a stellar-mass compact object inspiraling around the massive black hole through the dense dark-matter environment. Specifically, dynamical friction speeds up the inspiral of the compact object and causes feedback on the dark-matter distribution. These intermediate mass-ratio inspirals with dark matter are a source of gravitational waves (GWs), and the waves can dephase significantly from an equivalent system in vacuum. Prior work has shown that this dephasing needs to be modeled to detect the GWs from these systems with LISA (the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna); it also showed that the density and distribution of dark matter can be inferred from a GW measurement. In this paper, we study whether the parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework can be used to infer the presence of dark matter in these systems. We confirm that if vacuum waveform templates are used to model the GWs from an inspiral in a dark-matter halo, then the resulting parameter estimation is biased. We then apply the ppE framework to determine whether it can reduce the parameter-estimation biases, and we find that adding one ppE phase term to a waveform template eliminates the parameter-estimation biases (statistical errors become larger than the systematic ones), but the effective post-Newtonian order in the ppE framework must be specified without uncertainties. When the post-Newtonian order has uncertainty, we find that the systematic errors on the ppE and the binary's parameters exceed the statistical errors. Thus, the simplest ppE framework would not give unbiased results for these systems, and a further extension of it, or dedicated parameter estimation with gravitational waveforms that include dark-matter effects would be needed.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Modifications to Classifiers for Identification of Higgs Bosons</title>

Abstract: The Higgs boson, discovered back in 2012 through collision data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by ATLAS and CMS experiments, marked a significant inflection point in High Energy Physics (HEP). Today, it's crucial to precisely measure Higgs production processes with LHC experiments in order to gain insights into the universe and find any invisible physics. To analyze the vast data that LHC experiments generate, classical machine learning has become an invaluable tool. However, classical classifiers often struggle with detecting higgs production processes, leading to incorrect labeling of Higgs Bosons. This paper aims to tackle this classification problem by investigating the use of quantum machine learning (QML).</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, with $5$ of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings help to the understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

      <title>History of a Particle Bounded to the Cosmological LTB Black Hole Surrounded by the Quintom Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete set of analytic time-varying geodesic equations of the LTB black hole surrounded by the Quintom field. Indeed, we probe the evolution of the effective potential of such a black hole and possible photon orbits on cosmic epochs. We deduce that passing time in the accelerated universe from the early to late time epochs causes the peak of effective potential to decrease and shift to small radii, while the possibility of forming a stable orbit increases. Besides, four situations including: terminating bound orbit, stable orbit, scattering flyby orbit, and terminating escape orbit have been illustrated in some cosmic time slices. Moreover, changing orbits with time from the early universe to the late time epochs have been investigated. Furthermore, the stability of orbits and ISCO have been analyzed.</description>

Abstract: True muonium ($\mu^+\mu^-$) is one of the heaviest and smallest electromagnetic bound states not containing hadrons, and has never been observed so far. In this work it is shown that the spin-1 TM state (ortho-TM) can be observed at a discovery level of significance in three months at the CERN SPS North-Area H4A beam line, using 43.7 GeV secondary positrons. In this way, by impinging the positrons on multiple thin low-Z targets, ortho-TM, which decays predominantly to $e^+e^-$, can be produced from $e^+e^- \to TM$ interactions on resonance ($\sqrt{s} \sim 2m_{\mu}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the thermodynamics of the systems produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is crucial in understanding the QCD phase diagram. Recently, a new avenue has opened regarding the implications of large initial angular momentum and subsequent vorticity in the medium evolution in high-energy collisions. This adds a new type of chemical potential into the partonic and hadronic systems, called the rotational chemical potential. We study the thermodynamics of an interacting hadronic matter under rotation, formed in an ultra-relativistic collision. We introduce attractive and repulsive interactions through the van der Waals equation of state. Thermodynamic properties like the pressure ($P$), energy density ($\varepsilon$), entropy density ($s$), trace anomaly ($(\varepsilon - 3P)/T^{4}$), specific heat ($c_{\rm v}$) and squared speed of sound ($c_{\rm s}^{2}$) are studied as functions of temperature ($T$) for zero and finite rotation chemical potential. The conserved charge fluctuations, which can be quantified by their respective susceptibilities, are also studied. The rotational (spin) density corresponding to the rotational chemical potential is explored. In addition, we explore the possible liquid-gas phase transition in the hadron gas with van der Waals interaction in the $T$ -- $\omega$ phase space.</description>

      <title>Impact of Medium Anisotropy on Quarkonium Dissociation and Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quarkonium production in ultra-relativistic collisions plays a crucial role in probing the existence of hot QCD matter. This study explores quarkonia states dissociation and regeneration in the hot QCD medium while considering momentum anisotropy. The net quarkonia decay width ($\Gamma_{D}$) arises from two essential processes: collisional damping and gluonic dissociation. The quarkonia regeneration includes the transition from octet to singlet states within the anisotropic medium. Our study utilizes a medium-modified potential that incorporates anisotropy via particle distribution functions. This modified potential gives rise to collisional damping for quarkonia due to the surrounding medium, as well as the transition of quarkonia from singlet to octet states due to interactions with gluons. Furthermore, we employ the detailed balance approach to investigate the regeneration of quarkonia within this medium. Our comprehensive analysis spans various temperature settings, transverse momentum values, and anisotropic strengths. Notably, we find that, in addition to medium temperatures and heavy quark transverse momentum, anisotropy significantly influences the dissociation and regeneration of various quarkonia states.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Mass Model and Dark Matter with $Y=0$ Inert Triplet Scalar</title>

Abstract: We study a one-loop induced neutrino mass model with an inert isospin triplet scalar field of $Y=0$ and heavier isospin doublet vector-like leptons and singlet Majorana right-handed fermions. In addition to the neutrino mass matrix, We explain sizable scale of muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment $10^{-9}$ by introducing a singly-charged boson $S^\pm$. We show numerical analysis of neutrino oscillation, lepton flavor violations, Z boson decays, and demonstrate our allowed regions in cases of normal and inverted hierarchies. We find the sizable scale of muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment for both cases. Then, we move on to the discussion of dark matter candidates to satisfy the relic density where we have two candidates; fermionic dark matter and bosonic one. And, we classify four cases fermionic dark matter with normal and inverted hierarchies, bosonic one with normal and inverted hierarchies and search for each of the allowed points in the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the capabilities of a muon collider, at 3 and 10 TeV center-of-mass energy, of probing the interactions of the Higgs boson with the muon. We consider all the possible processes involving the direct production of EW bosons ($W,Z$ and $H$) with up to five particles in the final state. We study these processes both in the HEFT and SMEFT frameworks, assuming that the dominant BSM effects originate from the muon Yukawa sector. Our study shows that a Muon Collider has sensitivity beyond the LHC, as it not only relies on the Higgs-decay branching fraction to muons. A 10 TeV muon collider provides a unique sensitivity on muon and (multi-) Higgs interactions, significantly better than the 3 TeV option. We find searches based purely on multi-Higgs production to be particularly effective in probing these couplings.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of excess in $H \to Z \gamma$ using a light axion-like particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We interpret the recent excess in a rare decay of the Higgs boson, $H\to Z\gamma$, using a light axion-like particle (ALP) in the massrange $0.05 - 0.1$ GeV.The dominant decay of such a light ALP is into a pair of collimated photons, whose decay is required to happen before reaching the ECAL detector, such that it mimics a single photon in the detector. It can explain the excess with a coupling $C^{\rm eff}_{aZH} / \Lambda \sim 4 \times 10^{-5}\;{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, while the decay of the ALP before reaching the ECAL requires the diphoton coupling $C^{\rm eff}_{\gamma\gamma}/ \Lambda \ge 0.35 \,{\rm TeV}^{-1} (0.1\,{\rm eV}/m_a)^2$. A potential test would be the rare decay of the $Z$ boson $Z \to a H^* \to a (b \bar b)$ at the Tera-$Z$ option of the future FCC and CEPC. However, it has a branching ratio of only $O(10^{-12})$, and thus barely testable. The production cross section for $pp \to Z^* \to a H$ via the same coupling $C^{\rm eff}_{aZH} / \Lambda$ at the LHC is too small for detection.</description>

      <title>A plethora of long-range neutrino interactions probed by DUNE and T2HK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming neutrino experiments will soon search for new neutrino interactions more thoroughly than ever before, boosting the prospects of extending the Standard Model. In anticipation of this, we forecast the capability of two of the leading long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE and T2HK, to look for new flavor-dependent neutrino interactions with electrons, protons, and neutrons that could affect the transitions between different flavors. We interpret their sensitivity in the context of long-range neutrino interactions, mediated by a new neutral boson lighter than $10^{-10}$ eV, and sourced by the vast amount of nearby and distant matter in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and beyond. For the first time, we explore the sensitivity of DUNE and T2HK to a wide variety of $U(1)^\prime$ symmetries, built from combinations of lepton and baryon numbers, each of which induces new interactions that affect oscillations differently. We find ample sensitivity: in all cases, DUNE and T2HK may constrain the existence of the new interaction even if it is supremely feeble, may discover it, and, in some cases, may identify the symmetry responsible for it.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the radiative decays of singly heavy baryons, a crucial aspect of their spectroscopic behavior. To enhance the accuracy of our calculations, we utilize numerical spatial wave functions for the singly heavy baryons obtained through the Gaussian Expansion Method, which also yields their mass spectrum. As hadron spectroscopy enters an era of high precision, we believe our study of the radiative decays of singly heavy baryons will provide valuable insights for further exploration of these particles.</description>

      <title>Absorptive corrections to the electromagnetic form factor in high-energy elastic proton-proton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it was noted that absorptive corrections to the electromagnetic form factor in high-energy proton-proton scattering are important for the theoretical interpretation of the $p^\uparrow{p}$ and $p^\uparrow{A}$ analyzing power $A_\text{N}(t)$ measurements with the Hydrogen Jet Target polarimeter (HJET) at RHIC. Here, a concise expression for the absorptive correction was derived within the eikonal approach. The resulting analysis reveals a systematic bias, nearly independent of the beam energy, in the experimental determination of the real-to-imaginary ratio $\rho$ when absorption effects are overlooked in the data analysis. Quantification of this bias, as $\rho^\text{meas}=\rho + (0.036\pm0.016)_\text{bias}$, was achieved using a Regge fit applied to available proton-proton measurements of $\rho^\text{meas}(s)$ and $\sigma^\text{meas}_\text{tot}(s)$. Considering the potential impact of such an effect on the experimentally determined $A_\text{N}(t)$, one may enhance consistency between the HJET and STAR measurements of the hadronic spin-flip amplitude. While the sign of the bias in the value of $\rho$ aligns with the anticipated effective increase in the proton charge radius in $pp$ scattering due to absorption, it amplifies the observed discrepancy between $\sigma^\text{meas}_\text{tot}$ and $\rho^\text{meas}$ values at $\sqrt{s}=13\,\text{TeV}$ as measured in the TOTEM experiment. Evaluation (using published TOTEM data) of the measured proton-proton $d\sigma/dt$ dependence on the absorptive corrections indicated that possible soft photon corrections to the hadronic amplitude slope may be essential for such data analysis.</description>

      <title>Explaining PTA Results by Metastable Cosmic Strings from SO(10) GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper (see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.095053), we have demonstrated that the 2023 PTA results, which hint at a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies, point towards a promising model-building route for realizing $SO(10)$ Grand Unification with embedded inflation. The proposed supersymmetric scenario solves the doublet-triplet splitting without fine-tuning, accounts for charged fermion and neutrino masses, avoids conflicts with current proton decay bounds, and includes only representations no larger than the adjoint. It features multi-step breaking of $SO(10)$ to the Standard Model gauge symmetry, with inflation embedded such that metastable cosmic strings are produced at the end of inflation. This cosmic string network generates a stochastic GW background that can explain the PTA results. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the singled out GUT model class, focusing on how the gauge coupling unification condition affects the scales of multi-step $SO(10)$ breaking and the preferred GW spectra. The lowest breaking scale, linked to inflation, the generation of right-handed neutrino masses for the seesaw mechanism, and metastable cosmic string production, coincides with the range suggested by the PTA results.</description>

      <title>Coherent photo- and electroproduction of charmonia on nuclear targets revisited: Green function formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study for the first time the production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions based on a rigorous Green function formalism. Such formalism allows to incorporate properly formation effects (color transparency), as well as the quantum coherence inherent in higher twist shadowing corrections related to the $|Q \bar{Q}\rangle$ Fock component of the photon. The leading twist gluon shadowing associated with multi-gluon photon fluctuations is also included within the same formalism. The later effect represents the dominant source of shadowing at mid rapidities in the LHC kinematic region, while the reduced effect of quark shadowing leads to a significant modification of differential cross sections $d\sigma/dy$ at forward and/or backwards rapidities. Model calculations for $d\sigma/dy$ are in a good agreement with available UPC data on coherent charmonium production at RHIC and the LHC. In addition, we also perform predictions for nuclear effects in the electroproduction of charmonia, which can be verified by new data from electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>Towards an Interpretation of the First Measurements of Energy Correlators in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently been proposed as a class of jet substructure observables that directly link experimental measurements of the asymptotic energy flux with the field theoretic description of the underlying microscopic dynamics. This link holds particular promise in heavy-ion physics, where both experimental measurements and theoretical interpretations are inherently complex. With recent measurements of energy correlators in proton-proton collisions, the first measurement of these observables on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions underscores the importance of a theoretical understanding of their behavior in this complex environment. In this manuscript, we extend our previous calculations to account for several effects necessary for a qualitative understanding of the behavior of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Through a semi-analytic approach implemented in a hydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), we account for medium-induced radiation with leading broadening effects, selection biases arising from energy loss, and a description of the confinement transition. Our results represent a crucial first step towards interpreting the measurements of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions, which marks a significant milestone in connecting heavy-ion experiment and fundamental quantum field theory, in the quest to disentangle the microscopic dynamics of the QGP.</description>

      <title>Possible molecules of triple-heavy pentaquarks within the extended local hidden gauge formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the interactions between mesons and baryons in the open heavy sectors to identify potential triple-heavy molecular pentaquarks. We derive the meson-baryon interaction potentials using the vector meson exchange mechanism within the extended local hidden gauge formalism. The scattering amplitudes are computed by solving the coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation, revealing several bound systems. By analyzing the poles of these amplitudes in the complex plane, we determine the masses and widths of these bound states. Additionally, we evaluate the couplings and compositeness of different channels within each bound system to assess their molecular characteristics. Our predictions include four $\Omega_{ccc}$-like states, four $\Omega_{bbb}$-like states, fourteen $\Omega_{bcc}$-like states, and ten $\Omega_{bbc}$-like states, which could be targets for future experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Probing right-handed neutrinos via tri-lepton signals at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments have provided direct evidence for the existence of neutrino masses. The seesaw mechanism explains the smallness of these masses through the introduction of heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) states. The RHN states can aslo generate Dirac neutrino masses at tree or loop level. These heavy states can exist at the electroweak scale, approximately in the $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{GeV})$ range, and can be investigated through current and future collider experiments. This scenario, where other new physics interactions occur at scales much higher than the RHN scale, can be described using an effective field theory (EFT) framework known as $N_R$-EFT. This study focuses on constraining the Wilson coefficients of $N_R$-EFT operators, which primarily contribute to tri-lepton production and missing energy signals at the LHC. We examine both the scenarios where the RHN mass $M_N$ is less than and greater than the $W$ boson mass $M_W$, and provide predictions for the High-Luminosity run of the LHC (HL-LHC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the muon anomalous dipole moment $a_\mu$ in a model that extends the Standard Model with a scalar triplet and a lepton triplet. Different from previous studies, we find that there is still viable parameter space in this model to explain the discrepancy $\Delta a_\mu=a_{\mu}(\mathrm{Exp})-a_{\mu}(\mathrm{SM})$. While being consistent with the current data of neutrino mass, electroweak precision measurements and the perturbativity of couplings, our model can provide new physics contribution $a_\mu^\textrm{NP}$ to cover the central region of $\Delta a_\mu$ with new scalar and lepton mass as low as around TeV. This mass scale is allowed by the current collider searches for doubly charged scalars and the lepton triplet, and they can be tested at future high energy and/or high luminosity colliders.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Charged Higgs Bosons Production from Vector-Like $T$ Quark Decays at $e\gamma$ Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the extended framework of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model Type II (2HDM-II), enhanced by a vector-like quark (VLQ) doublet $TB$, we present a comprehensive analysis of the process $e^{-}\gamma \rightarrow b\nu_{e}\bar{T}$ at future high-energy $e\gamma$ colliders, focusing on the decays $\bar{T} \rightarrow H^{-} \bar{b}$ and $H^{-} \rightarrow \bar{t}b$. Using current theoretical and experimental constraints, we calculate production cross sections for both unpolarized and polarized beams at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 2$ and 3 TeV, demonstrating that polarized beams significantly enhance detection prospects by increasing production rates. By analyzing kinematic distributions, we establish optimized selection criteria to effectively separate signal events from background. At $\sqrt{s} = 2$ TeV with an integrated luminosity of 1500 fb$^{-1}$, we find exclusion regions within $s_R^d\in[0.085,0.16]$ for $m_T\in [1000,1260]$ GeV and a discovery potential within $s_R^d\in[0.14,0.17]$ for $m_T\in[1000,1100]$ GeV, with these regions expanding to $s_R^d\in [0.05,0.15]$ for $m_T\in[1000,1340]$ GeV and $s_R^d \in [0.11, 0.17]$ for $m_T\in[1000,1160]$ GeV at 3000 fb$^{-1}$. At $\sqrt{s} = 3$ TeV and 1500 fb$^{-1}$, we identify exclusion regions of $s_R^d\in[0.055,0.135]$ for $m_T \in [1000, 1640]$ GeV and discovery regions of $s_R^d \in [0.09, 0.15]$ for $m_T \in [1000, 1400]$ GeV, which further expand to $s_R^d \in [0.028, 0.12]$ for $m_T\in[1000,1970]$ GeV and $s_R^d \in[0.04,0.122]$ for $m_T\in[1000,1760]$ GeV at 3000 fb$^{-1}$. Our findings emphasize the increased detection potential at higher center-of-mass energies, particularly at 3 TeV compared to 2 TeV, with notable improvements when polarized beams are utilized. We also account for the effects of initial state radiation, beamstrahlung, and systematic uncertainties, which influence both exclusion and discovery prospects.</description>

Abstract: We apply the 3D glasma simulation method using Milne coordinates, proposed in our previous work [1], to the early stage of the Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV. The nucleus model prior to the collisions, which offers the initial condition for the 3D glasma simulation is constructed to account for the longitudinal structure of the nucleus, the finite thickness of nucleons and their random positions along the collision axis. We investigate rapidity profiles for a wide range of physical quantities of the glasma, including energy, pressure, fluctuations of topological charge, eccentricity, and angular momentum. In particular, we elucidate the behavior of eccentricity and angular momentum, which are physical quantities dependent on the geometric shape of the glasma, across a wide range of impact parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Full-shape BOSS constraints on dark matter interacting with dark radiation and lifting the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we derive constraints on interacting dark matter-dark radiation models from a full-shape analysis of BOSS-DR12 galaxy clustering data, combined with Planck legacy cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. We consider a set of models parameterized within the effective theory of structure formation (ETHOS), quantifying the lifting of the $S_8$ tension in view of KiDS weak-lensing results. The most favorable scenarios point to a fraction $f\sim 10-100\%$ of interacting dark matter as well as a dark radiation temperature that is smaller by a factor $\xi\sim 0.1-0.15$ compared to the CMB, leading to a reduction of the tension to the $\sim 1\sigma$ level. The temperature dependence of the interaction rate favored by relaxing the $S_8$ tension is realized for a weakly coupled unbroken non-Abelian $SU(N)$ gauge interaction in the dark sector. To map our results onto this $SU(N)$ model, we compute higher-order corrections due to Debye screening. We find a lower bound $\alpha_d\equiv g_d^2/(4\pi)\gtrsim 10^{-8} (10^{-9})$ for dark matter mass $1000 (1)$ GeV for relaxing the $S_8$ tension, consistent with upper bounds from galaxy ellipticities and compatible with self-interactions relevant for small-scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>Does the Cosmological Constant really indicate the existence of a Dark Dimension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the "dark dimension" (DD) scenario, we might live in a universe with a single compact extra dimension, whose mesoscopic size is dictated by the measured value of the cosmological constant. This scenario is based on swampland conjectures, that lead to the relation $\rho_{\rm swamp}\sim m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ between the vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm swamp}$ and the size of the extra dimension $m_{_{\rm KK}}^{-1}$ ($m_{_{\rm KK}}$ is the mass scale of a Kaluza-Klein tower), and on the corresponding result $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}$ from the EFT limit. We show that $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}$ contains previously missed UV-sensitive terms, whose presence invalidates the widely spread belief (based on existing literature) that the calculation gives automatically the finite result $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}\sim m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ (with no need for fine-tuning). This renders the matching between $\rho_{\rm swamp}$ and $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}$ a non-trivial issue. We then comment on the necessity to find a mechanism that implements the suppression of the aforementioned UV-sensitive terms. This should finally allow to frame the DD scenario in a self-consistent framework, also in view of its several phenomenological applications based on EFT calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of exclusive $J/\psi$, $\psi(2s)$, and electron-positron ($e^{+}e^{-}$) pair photoproduction in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions are reported by the STAR experiment at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}=200~\rm{GeV}$. We report several first measurements at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider, which are i) $J/\psi$ photoproduction with large momentum transfer up to $2.2~\rm{(GeV/c)^{2}}$, ii) coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction associated with neutron emissions from nuclear breakup, iii) the rapidity dependence of incoherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction, iv) the $\psi(2s)$ photoproduction cross section at mid-rapidity, and v) $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair photoproduction up to high invariant mass of 6 $\rm{GeV/c^2}$. For measurement ii), the coherent $J/\psi$ total cross section of $\gamma^{\ast} + \rm{Au} \rightarrow J/\psi + \rm{Au}$ as a function of the center-of-mass energy $W_{\rm{\gamma* N}}$ has been obtained without photon energy ambiguities. The data are quantitatively compared with the Monte Carlo models STARlight, Sartre, BeAGLE, and theoretical calculations of gluon saturation with color glass condensate, nuclear shadowing with leading twist approximation, Quantum Electrodynamics, and the Next-to-Leading Order perturbative QCD. At the photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 25.0 GeV, the coherent and incoherent $J/\psi$ cross sections of Au nuclei are found to be $71\pm10\%$ and $36\pm7\%$, respectively, of that of free protons. These data provide an important experimental constraint for nuclear parton distribution functions and a unique opportunity to advance the understanding of the nuclear modification effect at the top RHIC energy.</description>

      <title>Explicit form for the most general Lorentz transformation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12969v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit formulae for the $4\times 4$ Lorentz transformation matrices corresponding to a pure boost and a pure three-dimensional rotation are very well-known. Significantly less well-known is the explicit formula for a general Lorentz transformation with arbitrary nonzero boost and rotation parameters. We revisit this more general formula by presenting two different derivations. The first derivation (which is somewhat simpler than previous ones appearing in the literature) evaluates the exponential of a $4\times 4$ real matrix $A$, where $A$ is a product of the diagonal matrix ${\rm diag}(+1, -1, -1, -1)$ and an arbitrary $4\times 4$ real antisymmetric matrix. The formula for $\exp A$ depends only on the eigenvalues of $A$ and makes use of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial. The second derivation exploits the observation that the spinor product $\eta^\dagger\overline{\sigma}^{\lower3pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle \mu$}}\chi$ transforms as a Lorentz four-vector, where $\chi$ and $\eta$ are two-component spinors. The advantage of the latter derivation is that the corresponding formula for a general Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ reduces to the computation of the trace of a product of $2\times 2$ matrices. Both computations are shown to yield equivalent expressions for $\Lambda$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the existence of clouds of ultralight particles surrounding black holes during their cosmological history as members of a binary system can leave a measurable imprint on the distribution of masses and orbital eccentricities observable with future gravitational-wave detectors. Notably, we find that for nonprecessing binaries with chirp masses ${\cal M} \lesssim 10\,M_\odot$, formed exclusively in isolation, larger-than-expected values of the eccentricity, i.e. $e\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ at gravitational-wave frequencies $f_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-2}\,$Hz, would provide tantalizing evidence for a new particle of mass between $[0.5,2.5] \times 10^{-12}\,$eV in nature. The predicted evolution of the eccentricity can also drastically affect the in-band phase evolution and peak frequency. These results constitute unique signatures of boson clouds of ultralight particles in the dynamics of binary black holes, which will be readily accessible with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, as well as future mid-band and Deci-hertz detectors.</description>

      <title>Resonant history of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can produce superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons. When the black hole is part of a binary system, its cloud can undergo resonances and ionization. These processes leave a distinct signature on the gravitational waveform that depends on the cloud's properties. To determine the state of the cloud by the time the system enters the band of future millihertz detectors, we study the chronological sequence of resonances encountered during the inspiral. For the first time, we consistently take into account the nonlinearities induced by the orbital backreaction and we allow the orbit to have generic eccentricity and inclination. We find that the resonance phenomenology exhibits striking new features. Resonances can "start" or "break" above critical thresholds of the parameters, which we compute analytically, and induce dramatic changes in eccentricity and inclination. Applying these results to realistic systems, we find two possible outcomes. If the binary and the cloud are sufficiently close to counter-rotating, the cloud survives in its original state until the system enters in band; otherwise, the cloud is destroyed during a resonance at large separations, but leaves an imprint on the eccentricity and inclination. In both scenarios, we characterize the observational signatures, with particular focus on future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Dark Dimension and the Effective Field Theory limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the effective field theory (EFT) limit. One of the problems concerns the widely spread belief that in higher dimensional EFTs with compact dimensions the vacuum energy is automatically finite. On the contrary, our analysis shows that $\rho$ contains (previously missed) UV-sensitive terms. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are flawed, and provide further support to our findings. We conclude presenting ideas on the physical mechanism that should dispose of the large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Increasing the Masses of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the decoupling from the local expansion of the Universe. This work extends the definition of a zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions to different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec distances. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations on the Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups virialization. With these definitions, we present the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. Further, we estimate the masses of different galaxy groups and show that the inclusion of the Cosmological Constant in the analysis predicts these masses to be higher by 5-10\%. For instance the Local Group of Galaxies is estimated to be $(2.47 \pm 0.08) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. For the groups with enough tracers close to the TS, the contribution of the Cosmological Constant makes the masses to be even higher. The results show the importance of including the local cosmic expansion in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Legacy of boson clouds on black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons can leave an imprint on the gravitational waveform of black hole binaries through "ionization" and "resonances." We study the sequence of resonances as the binary evolves, and show that there are only two possible outcomes, each with a distinct imprint on the waveform. If the cloud and the binary are nearly counter-rotating, then the cloud survives in its original state until it enters the sensitivity band of future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. In all other cases, resonances destroy the cloud, while driving the binary to co-rotate with it and its eccentricity close to a fixed point. This opens up the possibility of inferring the existence of a new boson from the statistical analysis of a population of black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>First lattice QCD calculation of $J/\psi$ semileptonic decay containing $D$ and $D_s$ particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the first lattice calculation on the semileptonic decay of $J/\psi$ using the (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover gauge ensembles generated by CLQCD collaboration. Three gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings, from 0.0519 fm to 0.1053 fm, and pion masses, $m_{\pi}\sim$ 300 MeV, are utilized. After a naive continuum extrapolation using three lattice spacings, we obtain $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow D_s e\nu_e)=1.90(6)(5)_{V_{cs}}\times 10^{-10}$ and $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow D e\nu_e)=1.21(6)(9)_{V_{cd}}\times 10^{-11}$, where the first errors are statistical, and the second come from the uncertainties of CKM matrix element $V_{cs(d)}$. The ratios of the branching fractions between lepton $\mu$ and $e$ are also calculated as $R_{J/\psi}(D_s)=0.97002(8)$ and $R_{J/\psi}(D)=0.97423(15)$ after performing a continuum limit including only $a^2$ term. The ratios provide necessary theoretical support for the future experimental test of lepton flavor universality.</description>

      <title>Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ requires raising $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, also the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes from inflation constrained by dark matter substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of high-redshift massive galaxy candidates have initiated renewed interest in the important mystery around the formation and evolution of our Universe's largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We consider the possibility that some of them were seeded by the direct collapse of primordial density perturbations from inflation into primordial black holes and analyze the consequences of this on current dark matter substructures assuming non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation distributions. We derive bounds on the enhanced curvature perturbation amplitude from the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in our Galaxy, observations of stellar streams and gravitational lensing. We find this bound region significantly overlaps with that required for SMBH seed formation and enables us to probe Gaussian and non-Gaussian curvature perturbations corresponding to the SMBH seeds in the range ${\cal O}(10^5$-$10^{12}) M_\odot$.</description>
