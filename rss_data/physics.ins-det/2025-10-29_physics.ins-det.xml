      <title>Exploring an image-based $b$-jet tagging method using convolution neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet flavor tagging, the identification of jets originating from $c$-quarks, $b$-quarks, and other quarks (light quarks and gluons), is a crucial task in high-energy heavy-ion physics, as it enables the investigation of flavor-dependent responses within the hot and dense nuclear medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. Recently, several methods based on deep learning techniques, such as deep neural networks and graph neural networks, have been developed. These deep-learning-based methods demonstrate significantly improved performance compared to traditional methods that rely on track impact parameters and secondary vertices. In the tagging algorithms, various properties of jets and constituent charged particles are used as input parameters. We explore a new method based on images surrounding the primary vertex, utilizing charged particles within the jet cone, which can be measured using a silicon tracking system. For this initial experimental study, we assume the ideal performance of the tracking system. To analyze these images, we employed convolutional neural networks. The image-based flavor tagging method shows an 80-90% $b$-jet tagging efficiency for jets in the transverse momentum range from 20 to 100 GeV/$c$. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of jet flavor tagging in high-energy nuclear physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Tritiated methane reduction in the PandaX-4T experiment via purge and cryogenic distillation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tritium from tritiated methane (CH$_3$T) calibration is a significant impurity that restricts the sensitivity of the PandaX-4T dark matter detection experiment in the low-energy region. The CH$_3$T removal is essential for PandaX-4T and other liquid xenon dark matter direct detection experiments, as CH$_3$T serves as a critical component for low-energy calibration. To eliminate CH$_3$T, the xenon in the detector is suitably recuperated, leaving 1.8 bar of xenon gas inside, and the detector is flushed with heated xenon gas. Concurrently, leveraging the lower boiling point of methane relative to xenon, the PandaX-4T cryogenic distillation system is effectively utilized to extract CH$_3$T from xenon after optimizing the operational parameters. Following the commissioning run, 5.7 tons of xenon are purified via the distillation method. Recent data indicate that the CH$_3$T concentration reduces from $3.6\times10^{-24}$ mol/mol to $5.9\times10^{-25}$ mol/mol, demonstrating that gas purging and distillation are effective in removing CH$_3$T, even at concentrations on the order of $10^{-24}$ mol/mol.</description>

      <title>Design and characterization of a photosensor system for the RELICS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24196v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and characterization of a photosensor system developed for the RELICS experiment. A set of dynamic readout bases was designed to mitigate photomultiplier tube (PMT) saturation caused by intense cosmic muon backgrounds in the surface-level RELICS detector. The system employs dual readout from the anode and the seventh dynode to extend the PMT's linear response range. In particular, our characterization and measurements of Hamamatsu R8520-406 PMTs confirm stable operation under positive high-voltage bias, extending the linear response range by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, a model of PMT saturation and recovery was developed to evaluate the influence of cosmic muon signals in the RELICS detector. The results demonstrate the system's capability to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) signals under surface-level cosmic backgrounds, and suggest the potential to extend the scientific reach of RELICS to MeV-scale interactions.</description>

      <title>Development and Flight Trial of a UAV-based Gamma Ray and Neutron Detection System for Large-Area Radioactivity Mapping and Source Activity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in scintillation crystal and Silicon PhotoMultiplier (SiPM) technologies have enabled the development of compact, lightweight, and low-power radiation detectors that are suitable for integration with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This integration enables efficient and cost-effective large-area radiation monitoring while minimising occupational exposure. In this work, a SiPM-based NaIL scintillation detection payload was developed, characterised, and mounted on a multirotor UAV for gamma ray and neutron source localisation and activity estimation applications. To support these capabilities, an analytic radionuclide detection efficiency model was developed and used to estimate radioactivity on the ground from aerial energy spectrum measurements. The analytic expression for the detection efficiency incorporated physical phenomena, including the branching ratio, detector solid angle, air attenuation, and intrinsic peak efficiency, leading to agreement within 10% of experimental radionuclide detection efficiencies. The UAV-based radiation detection system was physically validated through a controlled indoor live radioactive source demonstration at 1.5 m, 3 m, and 4.5 m flight heights. Using the developed ground-level radioactivity estimation method, Cs-137 and Co-60 sources were successfully localised within 0.5 m, and their activities were estimated with errors on the order of 10% or less.</description>

      <title>ASTAROTH: A Novel Detector for Dark Matter Direct Detection Using Cryogenic SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DAMA experiment's long-standing claim of dark matter detection remains a key open issue in astroparticle physics. Independent verification requires NaI(Tl)-based detectors with enhanced low-energy sensitivity. Current detectors rely on photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) which features limited detection efficiency, intrinsic radioactivity, and high noise at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&amp;D project that developed a proof of concept NaI(Tl) detector where siliconphotomultipliers (SiPMs) have been used instead of PMTs, offering higher photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most of all, a reduction of two orders of magnitude in the dark noise. The setup includes a custom cryostat operating at approximately 80 K. We report the first characterization of an approximately 360 g NaI(Tl) crystal coupled to a 5 x 5 cm SiPM matrix, yielding 4.5 photoelectrons\keV after crosstalk correction. This promising result demonstrates the feasibility of SiPM-based readout for NaI(Tl) and paves the way for future large-scale dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T) for Particle Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks, SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset (ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at https://github.com/aaronw5/SAL-T4HEP.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Reconstruction using Discrete LED-Structured Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the use of digital signal processing to reconstruct continuous reflectance spectra using a small finite set of randomly illuminated light emitting diodes (LEDs). We simulate the use of LEDs having identical spectral distance and Gaussian bandwidth whose illumination overlaps its nearest neighbors. An object, whose reflectance spectrum is to be determined, is illuminated by a series of random spectral patterns consisting of randomly chosen LEDs with random intensity. We quantify the information within the illumination patterns using the singular value decomposition (SVD) and reconstruct reflectance spectra, specifically hemoglobin and several green vegetation spectra using the pseudoinverse of the SVD for a given amount of noise. We show that for sparse plant spectra, it is possible to reconstruct the continuous green vegetation spectra with RMSE less than 1% with as few as 25 LEDs. Our study demonstrates that reconstructing sparse reflectance spectra based on random structured illumination can enable low-cost LED-based cameras to perform equally well as expensive cameras, especially for dedicated applications.</description>

      <title>Noise Estimation and Suppression in Quantitative EMCD Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enables the measurement of magnetic moments with elemental and atomic site sensitivity, but its practical application is fundamentally limited by noise. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in EMCD measurements, demonstrated on Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae. By employing a classical three-beam geometry and long-term acquisition of electron energy-loss spectra, we systematically analyze the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across individual energy channels using bootstrap statistics. A robust energy alignment procedure based on the neighboring Ba-M4,5 edges with an adequate energy upsampling is introduced to minimize systematic errors from energy misalignment. The impact of detector noise, particularly from CMOS-based EELS cameras, is evaluated through variance-to-mean analysis and described by the noise amplification coefficients, revealing that detector-amplified shot noise is the dominant noise source. We recommend a stricter SNR threshold for reliable EMCD detection and quantification, ensuring that critical spectral features such as the Fe-L2,3 peaks meet the requirements for quantitative analysis. The approach also provides a framework for determining the minimum electron dose necessary for valid measurements and can be generalized to scintillator-based or direct electron detectors. This work advances the reliability of EMCD as a quantitative tool for magnetic characterization at the nanoscale with unknown magnetic structures. The proposed procedures lay the groundwork for improved error handling and SNR optimization in future EMCD studies.</description>

      <title>Removal of spallation-induced tritium from silicon through diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tritium, predominantly produced through spallation reactions caused by cosmic ray interactions, is a significant radioactive background for silicon-based rare event detection experiments, such as dark matter searches. We have investigated the feasibility of removing cosmogenic tritium from high-purity silicon intended for use in low-background experiments. We demonstrate that significant tritium removal is possible through diffusion by subjecting silicon to high-temperature (&gt; 400C) baking. Using an analytical model for the de-trapping and diffusion of tritium in silicon, our measurements indicate that cosmogenic tritium diffusion constants are comparable to previous measurements of thermally-introduced tritium, with complete de-trapping and removal achievable above 750C. This approach has the potential to alleviate the stringent constraints of cosmic ray exposure prior to device fabrication and significantly reduce the cosmogenic tritium backgrounds of silicon-based detectors for next-generation rare event searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a tonne-scale gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). It is designed to measure the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum with unprecedented energy resolution, better than 2% at 1 MeV. To fully achieve its designed performance, precise vertex reconstruction is crucial. This work reports two distinct vertex reconstruction methods, the charge center algorithm (CCA) and the deep learning algorithm (DLA). We describe the efforts in optimizing and improving these two methods and compare their reconstruction performance. The results show that the CCA and DLA methods can achieve vertex position resolutions better than 20mm (bias&lt;5mm) and 12mm (bias&lt;1.3mm) at 1 MeV, respectively, fully meeting the requirements of the TAO experiment. The reconstruction algorithms developed in this study not only prepare the TAO experiment for its upcoming real data but also hold significant potential for application in other similar experiments.</description>

      <title>Characterization of SiPMs at 40 K for neutrino coherent detection based on pure CsI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), as the core photoelectric sensor for coherent neutrino detection in low-temperature pure CsI, its working performance directly determines the measurement accuracy of the scintillator light yield. Our previous research has fully demonstrated the performance of pure CsI at liquid nitrogen temperature. More intriguingly, its performance is expected to be even better at 40 K. However, the performance characteristics of SiPM in the 40 K temperature range still remain to be explored. In this study, a self-developed adjustable temperature control system ranging from 30 K to 293 K was built to investigate the key performance parameters of SiPM at different temperatures, such as single photoelectron spectrum, gain, breakdown voltage, dark count rate, after-pulse, internal crosstalk, and single photoelectron resolution. Special emphasis was placed on examining the key performance parameters of SiPM in the 40 K temperature range to evaluate its feasibility for light yield measurement in this temperature range. The results show that this study obtained the parameter variation trends and optimal working conditions of 3 types of SiPM at different temperatures, thereby improving the sensitivity of the detector. This research provides important technical support for low-temperature detection in neutrino physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized magnetic-field sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19372v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Here, we present a fully integrated and mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor with a tip diameter of $1.25 \mathrm{mm}$. On its tip, a direct laser writing process is used to fixate a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core inside a polymer structure. Additionally, a metallic direct laser-written antenna structure next to the fiber facet allows efficient microwave manipulation of NV center spins. The sensor achieves a shot-noise-limited magnetic-field sensitivity of $5.9 \mathrm{nT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ using a $15 \mathrm{\mu m}$-sized microdiamond at a microwave power of $50 \mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15 \mathrm{mW}$. Using lock-in techniques, we measure a sensitivity of $51.8 \mathrm{nT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-fiber concept that enables, in combination with a direct laser-written structure, independent guiding of excitation and fluorescence light and thus reduces background autofluorescence. Moreover, controlled guiding of excitation light to the diamond while avoiding sample illumination may enable operation in light-sensitive environments such as biological tissue. While the demonstrated sensitivity is achieved using a single-fiber configuration, the dual-fiber approach provides a path towards integrating smaller diamonds, where autofluorescence would otherwise limit performance. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.</description>

      <title>The XLZD Design Book: Towards the Next-Generation Liquid Xenon Observatory for Dark Matter and Neutrino Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report describes the experimental strategy and technologies for XLZD, the next-generation xenon observatory sensitive to dark matter and neutrino physics. In the baseline design, the detector will have an active liquid xenon target of 60 tonnes, which could be increased to 80 tonnes if the market conditions for xenon are favorable. It is based on the mature liquid xenon time projection chamber technology used in current-generation experiments, LZ and XENONnT. The report discusses the baseline design and opportunities for further optimization of the individual detector components. The experiment envisaged here has the capability to explore parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter down to the neutrino fog, with a 3$\sigma$ evidence potential for WIMP-nucleon cross sections as low as $3\times10^{-49}\rm\,cm^2$ (at 40 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass). The observatory will also have leading sensitivity to a wide range of alternative dark matter models. It is projected to have a 3$\sigma$ observation potential of neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe at a half-life of up to $5.7\times 10^{27}$ years. Additionally, it is sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos from the sun and galactic supernovae.</description>

      <title>AstroPix: A Pixelated HVCMOS Sensor for Space-Based Gamma-Ray Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A next-generation medium-energy gamma-ray telescope targeting the MeV range would address open questions in astrophysics regarding how extreme conditions accelerate cosmic-ray particles, produce relativistic jet outflows, and more. One concept, AMEGO-X, relies upon the mission-enabling CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor silicon chip AstroPix. AstroPix is designed for space-based use, featuring low noise, low power consumption, and high scalability. Desired performance of the device include an energy resolution of 5 keV (or 10% FWHM) at 122 keV and a dynamic range per-pixel of 25-700 keV, enabled by the addition of a high-voltage bias to each pixel which supports a depletion depth of 500 um. This work reports on the status of the AstroPix development process with emphasis on the current version under test, version three (v3), and highlights of version two (v2). Version 3 achieves energy resolution of 10.4 +/- 3.2% at 59.5 keV and 94 +/- 6 um depletion in a low-resistivity test silicon substrate.</description>

      <title>Optimal Binning for Small-Angle Neutron Scattering Data Using the Freedman-Diaconis Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) data analysis often relies on fixed-width binning schemes that overlook variations in signal strength and structural complexity. We introduce a statistically grounded approach based on the Freedman-Diaconis (FD) rule, which minimizes the mean integrated squared error between the histogram estimate and the true intensity distribution. By deriving the competing scaling relations for counting noise ($\propto h^{-1}$) and binning distortion ($\propto h^{2}$), we establish an optimal bin width that balances statistical precision and structural resolution. Application to synthetic data from the Debye scattering function of a Gaussian polymer chain demonstrates that the FD criterion quantitatively determines the most efficient binning, faithfully reproducing the curvature of $I(Q)$ while minimizing random error. The optimal width follows the expected scaling $h_{\mathrm{opt}} \propto N_{\mathrm{total}}^{-1/3}$, delineating the transition between noise- and resolution-limited regimes. This framework provides a unified, physics-informed basis for adaptive, statistically efficient binning in neutron scattering experiments.</description>
