      <title>Automated Workflow for the Detection of Vugs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image logs are crucial in capturing high-quality geological information about subsurface formations. Among the various geological features that can be gleaned from Formation Micro Imager log, vugs are essential for reservoir evaluation. This paper introduces an automated Vug Detection Model, leveraging advanced computer vision techniques to streamline the vug identification process. Manual and semiautomated methods are limited by individual bias, labour-intensity and inflexibility in parameter finetuning. Our methodology also introduces statistical analysis on vug characteristics. Pre-processing steps, including logical file extraction and normalization, ensured standardized and usable data. The sixstep vug identification methodology encompasses top-k mode extraction, adaptive thresholding, contour identification, aggregation, advanced filtering, and optional filtering for low vuggy regions. The model's adaptability is evidenced by its ability to identify vugs missed by manual picking undertaken by experts. Results demonstrate the model's accuracy through validation against expert picks. Detailed metrics, such as count, mean, and standard deviation of vug areas within zones, were introduced, showcasing the model's capabilities compared to manual picking. The vug area distribution plot enhances understanding of vug types in the reservoir. This research focuses on the identification and characterization of vugs that in turn aids in the better understanding of reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Drivers of Layered Circulations in the South China Sea: Volume Flux or Vorticity Flux?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The South China Sea (SCS) features a unique layered circulation structure known as the cyclonic-anticyclonic-cyclonic (CAC) pattern, whose driving mechanisms remain a subject of debate. This study employs idealized numerical simulations using the MITgcm to investigate the role of volume flux and vorticity flux through the Luzon Strait (LS) to the SCS circulation. The control experiment successfully reproduces the observed "sandwiched" transport structure at the LS and the CAC circulation within the SCS. Sensitivity experiments, in which planetary vorticity is set to zero in the Pacific and LS, reveal that the CAC structure is insensitive to vorticity flux input. By applying the Stommel-Arons model to Cartesian coordinates, we provide analytical solutions that align with the simulation results, supporting the volume flux-driven hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the deep inflow through the LS is the primary driver of the layered circulation system, while the middle-layer outflow is a dynamical consequence. These results challenge the vorticity flux-driven hypothesis and offer new insights into the dynamics of layered circulations in the SCS.</description>

      <title>Positive effects and mechanisms of simulated lunar low-magnetic environment on earthworm-improved lunar soil simulant as a cultivation substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of crewed deep-space missions, Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for lunar bases face stresses from lunar environmental factors. While microgravity and radiation are well-studied, the low-magnetic field's effects remain unclear. Earthworms ("soil scavengers") improve lunar soil simulant and degrade plant waste, as shown in our prior studies. We tested earthworms in lunar soil simulant mixed with organic waste (from "Lunar Palace 365" experiment) under three magnetic conditions: lunar-low, Earth, and high. Stronger fields increased earthworm oxidative stress (MDA) and impaired neurotransmitters. Weaker fields enhanced substrate cultivability: neutralized pH, increased nutrients, humus, and wheat seedling rate. Microbial analyses showed: (1) Higher fungal Shannon index under high fields indicated impaired digestion; (2) More positive correlations in gut networks suggested slower microbial cooperation (e.g., lignocellulose degradation); (3) Reduced Network Size, Path Length and Modularity confirmed disrupted interactions. This disproves lunar low-magnetic stress on earthworm-soil-waste systems, aiding deep-space BLSS research.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the evolution of terrestrial relief through inverse elevation transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the examination of the Theory of Seismic Energy and the Theory of Volcanic Energy, we understand that the interaction of internal and external energies in favourable terrain has led to countless transformations over geological time frames. Therefore, this research aims to understand the evolution of the Earth's surface based on the theories proposed by Claudio Valverde Ramirez. This study introduces the concept of inverse elevation transition, which explains the formation of mountains, the constant and irregular dynamics of terrestrial relief, and the ongoing reshaping of the coastlines of continents and islands, which also depends on the fluidity of water masses.</description>

      <title>Thermochemical models of outer core convection with heterogeneous core-mantle boundary heat flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermochemical convection in Earth's outer core is driven by the crystallisation of the inner core that releases latent heat and light elements. A key question in core dynamics is whether a stable layer exists just below the core-mantle boundary. Recent core convection simulations, accounting for CMB heterogeneities, propose locally stable regions (or regional inversion lenses, RILs) rather than a global layer, allowing both stable and unstable regions to coexist. In this study, we consider a suite of numerical simulations of thermal, chemical, and thermochemical convection models focussed on Ekman number ($E=10^{-5}$) with thermal and chemical flux Rayleigh numbers $\widetilde{Ra}_T=30-4000$ and $\widetilde{Ra}_C=30-100000$, and thermal and chemical Prandtl numbers $Pr_T=1$ and $Pr_\xi=10$. Analysis of purely chemical models reveals light element accumulation (LEA) below the CMB, resulting in either locally stable regions near the poles or global layers, depending on the strength of chemical forcing. These chemically stratified regions persist in our thermochemical models even if the thermal field is fully destabilising. The addition of a heterogeneous CMB heat flux leads to the formation of RILs driven by thermal stratification. Stable regions in these thermochemical models have varying locations, properties, and morphologies depending on whether thermal or chemical convection dominates. In the investigated parameter range, these RILs are O(100 km) thick, and their strength and thickness generally increase with the strength of thermal driving; they are comparatively less sensitive to the strength of chemical driving. Our simulations reveal a diverse range of possible stable regions and/or a global layer at the top of Earth's core, with a seismically plausible range of thickness and strength, which may also have a signature in geomagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>Learning Physically Interpretable Atmospheric Models from Data with WSINDy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiscale and turbulent nature of Earth's atmosphere has historically rendered accurate weather modeling a hard problem. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest surrounding data-driven approaches to weather modeling, which in many cases show improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to traditional methods. However, many of the current data-driven approaches employ highly parameterized neural networks, often resulting in uninterpretable models and limited gains in scientific understanding. In this work, we address the interpretability problem by explicitly discovering partial differential equations governing atmospheric phenomena, identifying symbolic mathematical models with direct physical interpretations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in particular, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm can learn effective atmospheric models from both simulated and assimilated data. Our approach adapts the standard WSINDy algorithm to work with high-dimensional fluid data of arbitrary spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>The Frictional Brachistochrone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, I construct an elegant frictional brachistochrone for a mass point motion of a granular material with the Coulomb frictional energy dissipation that inherently includes the evolving path curvature. The simple model reveals several striking mechanical phenomena. It is applicable to any frictional particle. With increasing friction, the particle path becomes less and less curved until a straight brachistochrone is attained in the limit of sufficiently high friction. The existence of the straight-brachistochrone is phenomenal. Some potential industrial applications of the frictional brachistochrone are considered.</description>

      <title>Next-order balanced model captures submesoscale physics and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using nonlinear simulations in two settings, we demonstrate that QG$^\mathrm{+1}$, a potential-vorticity based next-order-in-Rossby balanced model, captures several aspects of ocean submesoscale physics. In forced-dissipative 3D simulations under baroclinically unstable Eady-type background states, the statistical equilibrium turbulence exhibits long cyclonic tails and a plethora of rapidly-intensifying ageostrophic fronts. Despite that the model requires setting an explicit, small value for the fixed scaling Rossby number, the emergent flows are nevertheless characterized by vorticity and convergence values larger than the local Coriolis frequency, as observed in upper-ocean submesoscale flows. Simulations of QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ under the classic strain-induced frontogenesis set-up show realistic frontal asymmetry and a provable finite time blow-up, quantitatively comparable to simulations of the semigeostrophic equations. The inversions in the QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ model are straightforward linear Poisson problems, allowing for the reconstruction of all flow fields from the PV and surface buoyancy, while avoiding the semigeostrophic coordinate transformation. Taken together, these results suggest QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ might be a useful tool for studying upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>
