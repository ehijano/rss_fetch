      <title>On modeling quantum point contacts in quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum point contacts (QPC) are a key instrument in investigating the physics of edge excitations in the quantum Hall effect. However, at not-so-high bias voltage values, the predictions of the conventional point QPC model often deviate from the experimental data both in the integer and (more prominently) in the fractional quantum Hall regime. One of the possible explanations for such behaviors is the dependence of the tunneling between the edges on energy, an effect not present in the conventional model. Here we introduce two models that take QPC spatial extension into account: wide-QPC model that accounts for the distance along which the edges are in contact; long-QPC model accounts for the fact that the tunneling amplitude originates from a finite bulk gap and a finite distance between the two edges. We investigate the predictions of these two models in the integer quantum Hall regime for the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude. We find that these two models predict opposite dependences: the amplitude decreasing or increasing away from the Fermi level. We thus elucidate the effect of the QPC geometry on the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude and investigate its implications for transport observables.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization from parallel transport of Bloch states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometric formulations of linear and nonlinear responses can be constructed from a single building block in the form of a gauge-invariant interband transition operator. Here, we identify a second building block for quantum geometry: a band-resolved adiabatic connection operator that captures the noncommutativity between band projectors and their momentum derivatives. The band-resolved adiabatic connection operator, first introduced in the theory of adiabatic driving, serves as a generalized angular momentum within the state manifold of single bands, and we employ it to reformulate expressions for the band-resolved orbital magnetic moment. This form provides a complementary geometric interpretation alongside the multiband separation between energetic- and quantum-state properties by the two-state Berry curvature. Our formalism allows us to present formulas valid for both nondegenerate and degenerate bands, thereby removing the limitations of the common Bloch-state formula. We illustrate our theory by calculating a large orbital magnetization emerging without spin-orbit coupling in a spin-compensated, noncoplanar anomalous Hall magnet with degenerate bands.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of InP/ZnSe quantum dots: effect of tetrahedral shape, valence band coupling and excitonic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy levels and optical transitions of tetrahedral core/shell InP/ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) are investigated by means of multi-band k$\cdot$p theory. Despite the $\overline{T}_d$ symmetry relaxing spherical selection rules, the near-band-edge excitonic spectrum is reminiscent of that obtained for spherical nanocrystals. Exceptions appear in large (red-emitting) QDs, where transitions violating the (quasi-)angular momentum selection rule ($\Delta L=0,\pm 2$) are observed, and the ground state does not become dark ($P_{3/2}$-like). Valence band coupling is important in determining the symmetry, degeneracy and energy of hole states, with split-off holes playing a greater role than in CdSe QDs. The ($1S_e$-like) electron ground state exhibits moderate delocalization into the ZnSe shell. The confinement regime is then strong even for thick shells, which results in Coulomb interactions being mostly perturbative. Electrons remain largely localized in the InP core even in negative trions, despite electron-electron repulsions. At the same time, the asymmetry between Coulomb attractions and repulsions leads to negative (positive) trions being bound (antibound) by tens of meV. The biexciton binding energy switches from positive to negative, depending on the QD size.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-resolved magnetoelastoresistance in multivalley bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a symmetry-resolved study of longitudinal magnetoelastoresistance (MER) in the multivalley material bismuth, with the current, uniaxial stress, and magnetic field all applied along the binary axis. The magnitude of MER exhibits a steep increase at low magnetic fields, reaches a peak, and then gradually decreases at higher fields. By decomposing the strain response into symmetric and antisymmetric symmetry channels, we reveal contrasting magnetic field dependencies. Despite the overall non-monotonic field dependence of the MER, the symmetric component remains nearly constant under magnetic fields, suggesting that the valleys in bismuth preserve a rigid-band nature against strain even in the presence of a magnetic field. In contrast, the antisymmetric component, associated with mobility anisotropy, dominates the MER response in a magnetic field. At low magnetic fields, the applied field effectively modifies the apparent mobility of each valley, leading to an enhancement in the magnitude of the antisymmetric MER. At higher fields, field-induced valley polarization further modifies this mobility anisotropy by altering the contributions from each valley's mobility, accounting for the moderate suppression of the MER. These findings demonstrate that symmetry-resolved MER serves as a powerful probe of valley-dependent electronic states and provides a fundamental platform for understanding the interplay between magnetic field, strain, and charge transport.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Sliding Switch in a 90-nm-Wide Nanostructured Chiral Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, renowned for their fascinating electromagnetic properties, hold potential for next-generation topological spintronic devices. Recent advancements have unveiled a rich tapestry of 3D topological magnetism. Nevertheless, the practical application of 3D topological magnetism in the development of topological spintronic devices remains a challenge. Here, we showcase the experimental utilization of 3D topological magnetism through the exploitation of skyrmion-edge attractive interactions in 90-nm-wide confined chiral FeGe and CoZnMn magnetic nanostructures. These attractive interactions result in two degenerate equilibrium positions, which can be naturally interpreted as binary bits for a skyrmion sliding switch. Our theory and simulation reveal current-driven spiral motions of skyrmions, governed by the anisotropic gradient of the potential landscape. Our experiments validate the theory that predicts a tunable threshold current density via magnetic field and temperature modulation of the energy barrier. Our results offer an approach for implementing universal on-off switch functions in 3D topological spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Current-controlled creations, deletions, and topological transformations of a single magnetic antiskyrmion in nanostructured cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnetic solitons have emerged as promising candidates for information carriers in spintronic devices, thanks to their fascinating electromagnetic properties. For fundamental device applications, the ability to electrically manipulate individual solitons is crucial. However, electrical manipulation of single antiskyrmions has been rarely demonstrated. In this work, we present current-controlled manipulations, encompassing the creation, deletion, and topological transformation of a single antiskyrmion within FeNiPdP nanostructured cells at room temperature. This nanostructure is uniquely designed with dimensions of about 400 nm in width and length, enabling the stabilization of a single antiskyrmion. By simply adjusting the density of nanosecond single-pulsed currents, we achieve the reversible creation and deletion of single antiskyrmions. Moreover, we uncover a rich variety of current-controlled topological transformations among individual antiskyrmions, skyrmions, bubbles, and ferromagnetic states. Our experimental findings are corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, highlighting the pivotal role of current-induced combined effects, such as spin transfer torque and Joule heating. Our results hold potential for advancing antiskyrmion-based device applications.</description>

      <title>Creating and Deleting a Single Dipolar Skyrmion by Surface Spin Twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report deterministic operations on single dipolar skyrmions confined in nanostructured cuboids using in-plane currents. We achieve highly reversible writing and deleting of skyrmions in the simple cuboid without any artificial defects or pinning sites. The current-induced creation of skyrmions is well-understood through the spin-transfer torque acting on surface spin twists of the spontaneous 3D ferromagnetic state, caused by the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction of the uniaxial Fe3Sn2 magnet with a low-quality factor. Current-induced deletions of skyrmions result from the combined effects of magnetic hysteresis and Joule thermal heating. Our results are replicated consistently through 3D micromagnetic simulations. Our approach offers a viable method for achieving reliable single-bit operations in skyrmionic devices for applications such as random-access memories.</description>

      <title>Modeling the dynamics of trapped electrons in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the dynamics of a system of two or three electrons that can be trapped to a localized state and detrapped to ab extended band states of a quantum dot using a simple model. In spite of its simplicity the time dependent problem has no analytical solution but a numerically exact one can be found at a relatively low computational cost. Within this model, we study the time evolution of the electron occupancies of conduction and valence bands and the trap state, as well as the statistical factors influencing light emission of different energies. In most of the analyzed cases, the system dynamics has a very short transient determined by the hopping parameters, that can be of tens of femptoseconds,followed by a quasi-stationary regime in which the electron occupancies either oscillate periodically around their time-averaged values or remain nearly constant. We find signatures of strong electronic correlations in the electronic motion for negative values of the effective electron-electron Coulomb interaction that are not translated to the statistical factors for light emission. Our calculations show that light emission of different energies is always possible except in the especial cases in which the valence band is initially filled with two electrons. In these cases the valence band can lose and recover electrons periodically but exciton emission is negligible at any time. We use this fact to attempt to give a possible explanation for the increase in the intensity of exciton emission with the concomitant decrease in the intensity of the green emission lines upon continuous illumination with ultraviolet radiation, experimentally observed for ZnO nanoparticles suspended in an alcohol.</description>

      <title>Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings. We integrate analytical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and \textit{in situ} Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments to demonstrate that externally applied strain is a powerful stimuli for manipulating three-dimensional magnetic skyrmion strings. Analytical models predict that strain induces both elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings in bulk systems, a finding corroborated by numerical simulations. These simulations further reveal that strain drives the system from fragmented multi-domain states toward unified single-domain configurations and facilitates skyrmion string rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. The collapse of the skyrmion lattice exhibits a temperature-dependent character, shifting from first-order to second-order behavior near the critical temperature $T_c$. Reducing sample thickness significantly increases the critical strain required for annihilation due to the suppression of tilting. Experimental validation on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirms strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism in this system, over magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of strain-mediated control in three-dimensional magnetic systems, demonstrating its feasibility for energy-efficient spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Kerr effect induced by exchange interaction of electrons separated by a tunnel barrier in a double quantum well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a structure with two tunnel-coupled quantum wells of different widths, the spin dynamics resulting from resonant pulsed optical pumping of the narrow-well exciton includes the wide-well electron magnetization dynamics. Our analysis shows that the effect is driven by electron exchange between narrow-well excitons and spin-polarized electrons in the wide well. A theoretical model of the spin Kerr effect has been developed accounting for the interwell electron spin exchange. In the studied double-well structure with CdTe and Cd$_{0.98}$Mn$_{0.02}$Te quantum wells and a well-separating barrier thickness of 5 monolayers (1.6 nm), the model accurately describes the experimental results and allows us to estimate the interwell electron exchange constant as $\delta_{e} \approx 0.9\times10^{-15}~\textrm{eV}~\textrm{cm}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Unconventional bright ground-state excitons in monolayer TiI$_2$ from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on \textit{ab initio} screened configuration interaction calculations we find that TiI$_2$ has a bright exciton ground state and identify two key mechanisms that lead to this unprecedented feature among transition metal dichalcogenides. First, the spin-orbit induced conduction band splitting results in optically allowed spin-alignment for electrons and holes across a significant portion of the Brillouin zone around the $\mathbf{K}$-valley, avoiding band crossings seen in materials like monolayer MoSe$_2$. Second, a sufficiently weak exchange interaction ensures that the bright exciton remains energetically below the dark exciton state. We further show that the bright exciton ground state is stable under various mechanical strains and that trion states (charged excitons) inherit this bright ground state. Our findings are expected to spark further investigation into related materials that bring along the two key features mentioned, as bright ground-state excitons are crucial for applications requiring fast radiative recombination.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian trapping of Dirac exciton-polariton condensates in a perovskite metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massless Dirac particles avoid trapping due to their exceptional tunneling properties manifested in the so-called Klein paradox. This conclusion stems from the conservative treatment, but so far, it has not been extended to a non-Hermitian framework. Recently, driven-dissipative bosonic condensation of Dirac exciton-polaritons was demonstrated in metasurface waveguides. Here, we report an experimental observation of spatial binding and energy quantization of Dirac exciton-polaritons in a halide perovskite metasurface. A combination of spatially profiled nonresonant optical excitation and exciton-polariton interaction forms an effective non-Hermitian complex potential responsible for the observed effect. In the case of tightly focused pump spots spanning from 9 to 17~$\mu$m, several bound states simultaneously achieve macroscopic occupation, constituting a multi-mode bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons. Our theoretical analysis based on the driven-dissipative extension of the Dirac equation reveals that the non-Hermitian character of the effective trap allows for confinement even in the case of the gapless Dirac-like photonic dispersion, both above and below the energy of the dispersion crossing.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall Control of Topological Qubits in the Kitaev SSH Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09693v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero energy states in one dimensional SSH Kitaev hybrid systems have emerged as promising candidates for topological qubits. In our work, we show that introducing a domain wall into a chain with anisotropic superconducting correlations provides a powerful way to control both the number and the nature of these boundary modes. The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of recent papers we have proved rigorously that time travel is a reality and very much feasible by using quantum mechanical processes. There are plenty of indirect experimental support untill a direct experiment is conducted. The process crucially depend on the reality of a local time as well as a local partial density of states (LPDOS) that can become negative very easily in the quantum regime of mesoscopic systems. Mesoscopic systems are small enough to allow us to experimentally access the intemediate regime between the classical and quantum worlds. This LPDOS is in every sense a hidden variable in quantum mechanics that does not show up in the axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics. It can be infered through physical clocks obeying quantum dynamics and can be rigorously justified from the properties of the Hilbert space that is uniquely isomorphic to the complex plane. Therefore one can naturally guess that LPDOS will have something important to say about quantum measurement as well as the unification of classical and quantum laws. We therefore undertake the exercise to show that LPDOS can very much allow us to re-interpret the enormously successful phenomenological Landauer-Buttiker formalism for mesoscopic systems and put it on firm theoretical ground as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, thereby unifying them. Essentialy the local time calculated quantum mechanically can dialate exactly like the proper time of relativity and be consistent with the coordinate time of relativity. Also the measured conductance of mesoscopic samples is a deterministic quantum measurement outcome from a linear superposition of states, essentially because of LPDOS, which solves the quantum measurement problem. For this we analyze the three probe conductance formula in details and give our arguements for the general case.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Superconducting Spin Valve in a van der Waals Ferromagnet/Superconductor/Ferromagnet Trilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate a gate-tunable superconducting spin valve effect (SVE) in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure composed of a monolayer superconductor (S) sandwiched between two ferromagnetic (F) monolayers (F/S/F). By electrostatically gating the ferromagnetic layers to modulate their chemical potentials, the system can be continuously tuned between the standard, inverse and triplet (non-monotonic) SVE regimes within the same device. This tunability originates from the gate-controlled hybridization between the superconducting and ferromagnetic electronic spectra, which determines the effective exchange field induced in the S-layer. Furthermore, we reveal that gating enables exotic, non-BCS temperature dependencies of the superconducting order parameter, including reentrant superconductivity, bistable states, first-order phase transitions, and the emergence of superconductivity at finite temperatures. Our results establish vdW F/S/F trilayers as a versatile and highly controllable platform for superconducting spintronics, where external gate voltages can selectively activate different spin-valve functionalities and unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Transport Scaling and Critical Tilt Effects in Disordered 2D Dirac Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions occur ubiquitously in condensed matter systems from topological phases to quantum critical points. Since the advent of topological semimetals, where the dispersion is often tilted around the band crossing where the Dirac fermion can appear, tilt has emerged as a key handle that controls physical properties. We study how tilt affects the transport and spectral properties of tilted 2D Dirac fermions under scalar disorder. Although our spectral analyses always show conformity to appropriate Gaussian ensembles, suggestive of delocalization, the conductivity scaling $g(L)$ shows a surprising richness. For a single Dirac node, relevant for quantum Hall transitions and topological insulator surface states, we find $g(L)\sim a_1\log(L)$ with a tilt-dependent coefficient $a_1&gt;0$. Interestingly, when the tilt and transport directions are aligned, $a_1$ and hence $g(L)$ shows a spike at the critical point between the type-I and type-II regimes of the Dirac node. For systems with two Dirac nodes with unbroken time-reversal symmetry, pertinent to quasi-2D Dirac materials, we find $g(L)\sim L^{a_1}(\log L)^{a_2}$. However, we find a surprising tension between tilt along and perpendicular to the transport directions. For the former, $a_1$ changes sign as a function of tilt, hinting at a tilt-driven localization-delocalization transition, while $a_1&lt;0$ for all tilts in the latter case, implying localization. These localized behaviors also reveal tension with the delocalization seen in spectral properties and suggest differing localization tendencies in real and Hilbert spaces. Overall, our work identifies tilt as an essential control parameter that uncovers rich and unconventional transport physics in 2D Dirac materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have attracted tremendous interest for revealing intriguing physics and promising spintronics applications. In contrast to conventional antiferromagnets, altermagnets break both PT and Tt symmetries, and simultaneously exhibit spin-split band structures with a vanishing net magnetization. To quantify insulating altermagnets without conduction electron, we propose to use magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) to identify the altermagnetic fingerprints. In particular, we demonstrate not only the giant MOKE responses, but also their connection with the orientations of Neel vectors at room temperature in altermagnet hematite alpha-Fe_2O_3. Specifically, under the Neel vector along the [1-100] axis, we find a giant polar Kerr rotation angle 93.4 mdeg in the (11-20) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2'/c'. Under the Neel vector along the [11-20] axis, we find a longitudinal Kerr angle 9.6 mdeg in the (0001) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2/c. Further, we show that such pronounced MOKE effects directly enable an optical imaging of altermagnetic domains, together with their reversible domain wall (DW) motion. Our studies not only suggest MOKE can be used to identify altermagnet candidates, but also signify the feasibility of exploring altermagnetic optical and DW spintronics, which could largely expand the current research paradigm of altermagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electric and thermoelectric transport through a spinful complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) quantum dot coupled to metallic leads, forming a N-SYK-N junction, by the Keldysh field theory approach. Unlike traditional equilibrium approaches, our formulation treats the system as an open, interacting quantum conductor under non-equilibrium conditions, without resorting to the replica trick. Starting from the exact Keldysh-Dyson equations, we derive analytical results for the tunneling and zero-temperature limits and perform a numerical analysis in the linear-response regime. We characterize the dependence of conductance, thermoelectric coefficient, and Seebeck effect on the particle-hole asymmetry parameter and coupling strength to the leads. Our results reveal distinctive non-Fermi liquid signatures of the SYK model in transport properties and identify coupling regimes where thermoelectric effects are enhanced, suggesting experimentally accessible fingerprints of SYK physics in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Characterization of the Magnetic Properties of Vanadium-doped Ti2C MXenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MXenes are two-dimensional materials composed of transition metals and light elements, known for their high conductivity and versatile surface chemistry. The introduction of spin centers via doping can lead to promising materials for spintronics, magnetic sensing, and data storage. We study the effect of V doping in Ti2C using first principle and Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results show that pristine Ti2C exhibits ferromagnetic intralayer and antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange interactions, yielding an antiferromagnetic ground state. Vanadium incorporation alters these couplings, yet all doped configurations - Ti7VC4 and three Ti6V2C4 variants - retain predominantly antiferromagnetic order. Despite the preserved ground state, V doping enhances the magnetic response, most notably in the p-Ti6V2C4 configuration, which displays increased low-field susceptibility and partial spin alignment across layers. As experimentally isolating individual doped phases is unlikely, samples will consist of mixed configurations whose collective behavior nonetheless exhibits clear signatures of V-induced magnetic modification. These results reveal how transition-metal substitution tunes exchange interactions in MXenes and offer guidance for engineering their magnetic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Three-body interaction in a magnon-Andreev-superconducting qubit system: collapse-revival phenomena and entanglement redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-body interactions are fundamental for realizing novel quantum phenomena beyond pairwise physics, yet their implementation -- particularly among distinct quantum systems -- remains challenging. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum architecture comprising a magnonic mode (in a YIG sphere), an Andreev spin qubit (ASQ), and a superconducting qubit (SCQ), to realize a strong three-body interaction at the single-quantum level. Leveraging the spin-dependent supercurrent and circuit-integration flexibility of the ASQ, it is possible to engineer a strong tripartite coupling that jointly excites both qubits upon magnon annihilation (or excites magnons and SCQs upon ASQ deexcitation). Through analytical and numerical studies, we demonstrate that this interaction induces synchronized collapse and revival in qubit populations when the magnon is initially prepared in a coherent state. Notably, during the collapse region -- where populations remain static -- the entanglement structure undergoes a dramatic and continuous reorganization. We show that the genuine tripartite entanglement is redistributed into bipartite entanglement between the two qubits, and vice versa, with the total entanglement conserved. These phenomena, unattainable via two-body couplings, underscore the potential of three-body interactions for exploring intrinsically new quantum effects and advancing hybrid quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>Gate tuning of coupled electronic and structural phase transition in atomically thin Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing an excitonic insulator phase from narrow-gap semiconductors remains challenging, as unambiguous experimental signatures are difficult to establish. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ has been widely regarded as a leading candidate, yet the nature of its phase transition and insulating state remains controversial. Here, we report a systematic Raman spectroscopy study of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ as a function of thickness and field-effect doping, complemented by electrical transport measurements. The phase transition persists down to the monolayer limit, with the critical temperature increasing as thickness decreases. In bilayer samples, both electron and hole doping suppress the insulating state, with electron doping lowering and hole doping raising the transition temperature. Importantly, the quasi-elastic scattering, previously attributed to excitonic fluctuations, evolves monotonically across the entire doping range, inconsistent with the expected suppression of excitonic correlations by Coulomb screening. These findings rule out a dominant excitonic mechanism and instead point to a coupled electronic and structural phase transition, whose stability is tunable by carrier doping. Our doping-based approach offers a general strategy for evaluating the role of excitonic effects in candidate excitonic insulators.</description>

      <title>Biaxial Strain Modulation of Exciton-Phonon Resonance in WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical strain provides a powerful route to tune light-matter interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors, yet the impact of biaxial strain on resonant Raman scattering remains poorly quantified. Here we use a cruciform bending platform to apply uniform biaxial strain up to 1.3% to trilayer WS2 while simultaneously monitoring excitonic and vibrational responses. Differential reflectance reveals strain-induced red-shifts of the A and B excitons, with the B exciton moving by about 170 meV. Under 532 nm excitation, this shift drives a continuous transition from resonant to non-resonant Raman scattering, leading to a pronounced collapse of the 2LA(M) mode. The 2LA(M) intensity is quantitatively described by a resonance model expressed in terms of the B-exciton energy, which yields an effective exciton-assisted linewidth of about 34 meV and shows that the maximum enhancement occurs when the laser lies roughly 50 meV below the exciton. The first-order phonons remain narrow and reversible over the full strain cycle, confirming elastic deformation and efficient isotropic strain transfer. Our results establish biaxial strain as a practical and reversible route to modulate exciton-phonon coupling and Raman scattering cross-sections, enabling mechanically reconfigurable optical and photonic functionalities in layered semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent Polarization Propagator Calculation for Quantum Dots Using Optimized Inverse Krylov Subspace and Folded-Spectrum Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the frequency response of quantum dots under electromagnetic radiation is essential for investigating absorption spectra, excitonic effects, and nonlinear optical behavior in quantum dots and semiconductor nanoparticles. The polarization propagator provides a rigorous framework for evaluating these properties, but its construction is computationally demanding. Challenges arise from the level of electron correlation, the size of the excitonic basis, and the cost of evaluating two-electron integrals. This work addresses these difficulties by developing first- and second-order frequency-dependent polarization propagator calculations for PbS and CdS quantum dots. The propagator is formulated using the electron propagator approach and expressed as the resolvent of the Hamiltonian superoperator. Light-matter interaction is treated using the dipole approximation and represented in a particle-hole excitation operator basis. The correlated ground state is treated at the MP2 level, and all response-matrix terms up to second order in the fluctuating potential are included. A frequency-dependent inverse Krylov subspace method is derived and combined with the folded-spectrum technique to isolate excitation energies within a chosen frequency window. This strategy avoids full diagonalization of the response matrix and significantly reduces computational cost for large systems. The method is implemented in a matrix-free manner in which no explicit response matrix is assembled, and all operations rely on matrix-vector products. UV-VIS excitation spectra of PbS and CdS quantum dots were computed, demonstrating that the inverse Krylov subspace projection approach provides an efficient and accurate approximation for excitation spectra when full diagonalization is computationally prohibitive.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enrich quantum physics by extending conventional phase diagrams, enabling novel topological phenomena, and realizing exceptional points with potential applications in quantum sensing. Here, we present an experimental photonic platform capable of simulating a non-unitary quantum walk generated by a peculiar type of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, largely unexplored in the literature. The novelty of this platform lies in its direct access to the reciprocal space, which enables us to scan the quasi-momentum across the entire Brillouin zone and thus achieve a precise tomographic reconstruction of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, indicated by the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. From the inferred Hamiltonian, it is possible to retrieve complex-valued band structures, resolve exceptional points in momentum space, and detect the associated parity-time symmetry breaking through eigenvector coalescence. Our results, presented entirely in quasi-momentum space, represent a substantial shift in perspective in the study of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the gate-induced insulator-to-metal transition in the charge-density-wave (CDW) phase of the Holstein model. Large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations are performed, in which the forces acting on the lattice degrees of freedom are evaluated using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. We demonstrate that the onset of CDW instability requires a threshold bias voltage set by the energy of in-gap edge modes. At sufficiently large voltages, the system undergoes an abrupt transition to a metallic state, reminiscent of dielectric breakdown. In the intermediate-voltage regime, our simulations reveal that the transition to a low-resistance state is initiated by the nucleation of a thin conducting layer at the gated electrode. The resulting metal-insulator interface subsequently propagates across the system under the applied bias, leading to the growth of a metallic domain. We further analyze the voltage- and temperature-dependent dynamics of the associated domain walls.</description>

      <title>Optically induced magnetic inertia and magnons from non-Markovian extension of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau-Lisfhitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has been the cornerstone of modeling the dynamics of localized spins, viewed as classical vectors of fixed length, within nonequilibrium magnets. When light is employed as the nonequilibrium drive, the LLG equation must be supplemented with additional terms that are usually conjectured using phenomenological arguments for direct opto-magnetic coupling between localized spins and (real or effective) magnetic field of light. However, direct coupling of magnetic field to spins is 1/c smaller than coupling of light and electrons; or both magnetic and electric fields are too fast for slow classical spins to be able to follow them. Here, we displace the need for phenomenological arguments by rigorously deriving an extended LLG equation via Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT). Within such a theory, light interacts with itinerant electrons, and then spin current carried by them exerts spin-transfer torque onto localized spins, so that when photoexcited electrons are integrated out we arrive at a spin-only equation. Unlike the standard phenomenological LLG equation with local-in-time Gilbert damping, our extended one contains a non-Markovian memory kernel whose plot within the plane of its two times variables exhibits fractal properties. By applying SKFT-derived extended LLG equation, as our central result, to a light-driven ferromagnet as an example, we predict an optically induced magnetic inertia term. Its magnitude is governed by spatially nonlocal and time-dependent prefactor, leading to excitation of coherent magnons at sharp frequencies in and outside of the band of incoherent (or thermal) magnons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic inertial dynamics has recently been predicted and experimentally demonstrated in two-sublattice ferromagnets such as CoFeB and NiFe permalloy. In this work, we investigate the spin-wave spectrum of such systems by incorporating the complete magnetic inertia tensor. By decomposing the tensor into symmetric and antisymmetric components, we identify isotropic, anisotropic, and chiral contributions to magnetic inertia. Within linear spin-wave theory, we find that the spectrum comprises two precessional and two inertial magnon bands. Remarkably, the upper precessional band intersects the lower inertial band within the Brillouin zone. Both cross-sublattice and chiral components of the inertia tensor act as effective control parameters for tuning these magnonic band structures. Furthermore, we show that the inertial spin-wave spectrum becomes nonreciprocal along propagation directions where the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is finite. Strikingly, a similar nonreciprocity can also arise purely from chiral inertia, even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our findings establish magnetic inertia as a new pathway to engineer nonreciprocal magnon transport and ultrafast spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>N\'eel-Vector-Orientation Induced Intrinsic Half-Metallicity in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>

Abstract: Whether a zero-moment antiferromagnet can host an intrinsic half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface remains an open question in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Existing proposals in compensated magnets reach only transport analogues of this limit and do not realize a genuine AFM half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface. Here we show that in two-dimensional altermagnets the N\'eel-vector orientation acts as an intrinsic knob for magnetic-space-group reduction that lifts the degeneracy between spin sectors. Using Janus monolayer Ta$_2$TeSeO as a realistic and clean platform and combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that rotating the N\'eel vector first breaks the relevant mirror symmetry, opening a gap in one spin sector of symmetry-related Weyl pairs, and then breaks the residual $C_{2z}$ symmetry, shifting the remaining Weyl cones in opposite energy directions so that a single spin sector retains a Fermi surface at the Fermi level. These two symmetry-lowering steps convert a compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetal into an intrinsic AFM half-metal. The nearly degenerate in-plane magnetic anisotropy then enables reversible switching between the two spin channels using minute strain or weak anisotropic fields. Because this mechanism relies solely on N\'eel-vector-induced symmetry reduction, it provides a general low-power route to intrinsic half-metallicity in compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional Euclidean and non-Euclidean structures in planar circuit quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.08854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a recent proposal for simulating planar hyperbolic lattices with circuit quantum electrodynamics can be extended to accommodate also higher dimensional lattices in Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces if one allows for circuits with more than three polygons at each vertex. The quantum dynamics of these circuits, which can be constructed with present-day technology, are governed by effective tight-binding Hamiltonians corresponding to higher-dimensional Kagom\'{e}-like structures ($n$-dimensional zeolites), which are well known to exhibit strong frustration and flat bands. We analyze the relevant spectra of these systems and derive an exact expression for the fraction of flat-band states. Our results expand considerably the range of non-Euclidean geometry realizations with circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Majorana edge and end states in planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied. We propose exploiting the extended nature of edge-like MSs as effective interconnects enabling the coupling between topological states in adjacent planar JJs. The impact of electrostatic disorder on the MSs is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Field and Strain Engineering of Modulated Transverse Transport in Altermagnetic Topological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16553</link>

Abstract: Here, we explore the role of inherent altermagnetic topology in transverse transport phenomena (such as crystal/anomalous Hall, Nernst, and thermal Hall effects) in several famous altermagnets, including tetragonal \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O (\textit{X} = K, Rb, Cs; \textit{Y} = S, Se, Te), RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, as well as hexagonal CrSb and MnTe. Notably, in \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O, the first experimentally realized layered altermagnets, transverse transport is governed by altermagnetic pseudonodal surfaces, emphasizing the purely topological contributions to transverse transport. Interestingly, we demonstrate that strain engineering and magnetic field, two unique methods for selectively controlling crystal and anomalous transport, can substantially enhance the magnitude of these phenomena while preserving the alternating spin characteristics in both real and momentum space. Moreover, due to the spin symmetry breaking via shear strain, a new magnetic phase, fully compensated ferrimagnetism, with isotropic spin splitting, can be induced. Our findings provide effective strategies not only for manipulating transverse transport in altermagnets but also for controlling magnetic phase transitions, offering valuable insights for their potential applications in spintronics and spin caloritronics.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamond: Size, Depth, and Surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provides a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.</description>

      <title>Magnetic resonance and microwave resistance modulation in van der Waals colossal-magnetoresistance material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is a fascinating quantum phenomenon that continues to draw significant interest in condensed matter physics. Mn3Si2Te6 has emerged as a prototypical CMR material, notable for its puzzling magnetoresistance behavior and pronounced directional anisotropy. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms driving CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 remain elusive [1-4]. In this work, we explore the magnetic resonance of Mn3Si2Te6 and observe a reduced g-factor for magnetic fields applied along the crystalline c-axis compared to the ab-plane, indicating a substantial orbital magnetization contribution along the c-axis. Furthermore, we detect resistance modulation under resonance conditions, suggesting that CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 is sensitive to the out-of-the plane spin polarization. These findings shed new light on the role of orbital magnetic moment in Mn3Si2Te6, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom of electrons in this system.</description>
