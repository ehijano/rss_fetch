      <title>Transferable potential for molecular dynamics simulations of borosilicate glasses and structural comparison of machine learning optimized parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of borosilicate glasses is challenging due to the composition and temperature dependent coordination state of boron atoms. Here, we present a newly developed machine learning optimized classical potential for molecular dynamics simulations that achieves transferability across diverse borosilicate glass compositions. Our potential accurately predicts the glass structural variations in short- and medium-range order in different glass compositions, including validating our potential against experimental X-ray structure factor data. Notably, these data are not included in the optimization framework, which focuses exclusively on density and four-fold coordinated boron fraction. We further investigate the impact of empirical parameters in the force field formulation on the microscopic bond lengths, bond angles and the macroscopic densities, providing new insights into the relationship between interatomic potentials and bulk glass behaviors.</description>

      <title>Impact of Random Spatial Truncation and Reciprocal-Space Binning on the Detection of Hyperuniformity in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how finite-window sampling (random spatial truncation) and reciprocal-space radial binning influence the detection of hyperuniformity in disordered systems. Using thirteen representative two-dimensional simulation systems (two stealthy hyperuniform systems with distinct constraint parameters and ; hyperuniform Gaussian pair statistics system; six hyperuniform targeted systems with distinct alpha=0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 3.0, random sequential addition system; Poisson points distribution system; Lennard-Jones fluid system and Yukawa fluid system) and two real biological systems (avian photoreceptor patterns and looped leaf vein networks) We find that moderate random spatial truncation (i.e., randomly extracting a smaller subwindow from the original full-field configuration) does not change qualitatively the hyperuniformity classification of the systems. Specifically, disordered hyperuniform systems retain their respective hyperuniformity classes despite a modest reduction in measured hyperuniformity exponent alpha (i.e., reduction in small-k suppression). Moreover, spatial truncation commonly induces configuration-dependent fluctuations of small-k values of S(k). We show that modest reciprocal-space radial pooling (controlled by a binning parameter m) effectively smooths such spurious wiggles without changing the hyperuniformity class. Practical guidelines for choosing m, cross-checking spectral fits with the local number variance scaling, and increasing effective sampling are provided. These results provide concrete, low-cost and effective methodology for robust spectral detection of hyperuniformity in finite and truncated datasets which abound in experimental systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic study of mixed lithium halides solid state electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium halides with the general formula Li$_x$M$_y$X$_6$, where M indicates transition metal ions and X halide anions are very actively studied as solid-state electrolytes, because of relatively low cost, high stability and Li conductivity. The structure and properties of these halide-based solid electrolytes (HSE) can be tuned by alloying, e.g. using different halides and/or transition metals simultaneously. The large chemical space is difficult to sample by experiments, making simulations based on broadly applicable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) a promising approach to elucidate structure-property relations, and facilitate the design of better-performing compositions. Here we focus on the Li$_3$YCl$_{6x}$Br$_{6(1-x)}$ system, for which reliable experimental data exists, and use the recently-developed PET-MAD universal MLIP to investigate the structure of the alloy, the interplay of crystalline lattice, volume and chemical composition, and its effect on Li conductivity. We find that the distribution of Cl and Br atoms is only weakly correlated, and that the primary effect of alloying is to modulate the lattice parameter -- although it can also trigger transition between different lattice symmetries. By comparing constant-volume and constant-pressure simulations, we disentangle the effect of lattice parameter and chemical composition on the conductivity, finding that the two effects compensate each other, reducing the overall dependency of conductivity on alloy composition. We also study the effect of Y-In metal substitution finding a small increase in the conductivity for the C2/m phase at 25\% In content, and an overall higher conductivity for the P$\bar{3}$m1 phase.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of vector Hopfield network near and above saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically a Hopfield fully-connected network with $d$-dimensional vector spins. These networks are models of associative memory that generalize the standard Hopfield with Ising spins, where $P$ examples are stored in a network of $N$ units as local minima in an energy landscape. We study the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties of the system, considering the system in its retrieval phase $\alpha&lt;\alpha_c$ and beyond, where $\alpha=P/N$ is the capacity of the system and $\alpha_c$ is its critical value, above which storage fails. We derive the Replica Symmetric solution for the equilibrium thermodynamics of the system, together with its phase diagram: we find that the retrieval phase of the network shrinks with growing spin dimension, having ultimately a vanishing critical capacity $\alpha_c\propto 1/d$ in the large $d$ limit. As a trade-off, we observe that in the same limit vector Hopfield networks are able to denoise corrupted input patterns in the first step of retrieval dynamics, up to very large capacities $\alpha\propto d$. We also study the static properties of the system at zero temperature, considering the statistical properties of soft modes of the energy Hessian spectrum. We find that local minima of the energy landscape related to memory states have ungapped spectra with rare soft eigenmodes: these excitations are localized, their measure condensating on the noisiest neurons of the memory state.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical toolkit for the Anderson model in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature does not readily provide, however, practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Optimal Self-Distillation in Noisy Gaussian Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16226v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model improves itself using its own predictions, has attracted attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD with a linear classifier for binary classification on noisy Gaussian mixture data. For the analysis, we employ the replica method from statistical physics. Our findings reveal that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also identify two practical heuristics to enhance SD: early stopping that limits the number of stages, which is broadly effective, and bias parameter fixing, which helps under label imbalance. To empirically validate our theoretical findings derived from our toy model, we conduct additional experiments on CIFAR-10 classification using pretrained ResNet backbone. These results provide both theoretical and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</description>

      <title>Designing topological cluster synchronization patterns with the Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronization has been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model, we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on real connectome data, random graphs, and on stochastic block models.</description>
