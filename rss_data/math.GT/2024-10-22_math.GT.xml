      <title>On the symmetric braid index of ribbon knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the symmetric braid index $b_s(K)$ of a ribbon knot $K$ to be the smallest index of a braid whose closure yields a symmetric union diagram of $K$, and derive a Khovanov-homological characterisation of knots with $b_s(K)$ at most three. As applications, we show that there exist knots whose symmetric braid index is strictly greater than the braid index, and deduce that every chiral slice knot with determinant one has braid index at least four. We also calculate bounds for $b_s(K)$ for prime ribbon knots with at most 11 crossings.</description>

      <title>$N$-dimensional beaded necklaces and higher dimensional wild knots, invariant by a Schottky group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with a smooth $n$-dimensional knot $K\subset\bS^{n+2}$, and a beaded $n$-dimensional necklace subordinated to $K$, we construct a wild knot with a Cantor set of wild points (\ie the knot is not locally flat in these points). The construction uses the conformal Schottky group acting on $\bS^{n+2}$, generated by inversions on the spheres which are the boundary of the``beads''. We show that if $K$ is a fibered knot then the wild knot is also fibered. We also study cyclic branched coverings along the wild knots.</description>

      <title>Connectivity in the space of framed hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the space $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ of framed infinite volume hyperbolic $3$-manifolds is connected but not path connected. Two proofs of connectivity of this space, which is equipped with the geometric topology, are given, each utilizing the density theorem for Kleinian groups. In particular, we decompose $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ into a union of leaves, each leaf corresponding to the set of framings on a fixed manifold, and construct a leaf which is dense in $\mathcal{H}_\infty$. Examples of paths in $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ are discussed, and machinery for analyzing general paths is developed, allowing for a description of paths of convex cocompact framed manifolds. The discussion of paths culminates in describing an infinite family of non-tame hyperbolic $3$-manifolds whose corresponding leaves are path components of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$, which establishes that $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ is not path connected.</description>

      <title>On the neighborhood of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript introduces a new framework for the study of knots by exploring the neighborhood of knot embeddings in the space of simple open and closed curves in 3-space. The latter gives rise to a knotoid spectrum, which determines the knot type via its knot-type knotoids. We prove that the pure knotoids in the knotoid spectra of a knot, which are individually agnostic of the knot type, can distinguish knots of Gordian distance greater than one. We also prove that the neighborhood of some embeddings of the unknot can be distinguished from any embedding of any non-trivial knot that satisfies the cosmetic crossing conjecture. Topological invariants of knots can be extended to their open curve neighborhood to define continuous functions in the neighborhood of knots. We discuss their properties and prove that invariants in the neighborhood of knots may be able to distinguish more knots than their application to the knots themselves. For example, we prove that an invariant of knots that fails to distinguish mutant knots (and mutant knotoids), can distinguish them by their neighborhoods, unless it also fails to distinguish non-mutant pure knotoids in their spectra. Studying the neighborhood of knots opens the possibility of answering questions, such as if an invariant can detect the unknot, via examining possibly easier questions, such as whether it can distinguish height one knotoids from the trivial knotoid.</description>

      <title>Profinite almost rigidity in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any compact, orientable 3-manifold with empty or incompressible toral boundary is profinitely almost rigid among all compact, orientable, boundary-incompressible 3-manifolds, i.e. the profinite completion of its fundamental group determines its homeomorphism type up to finitely many possibilities. Moreover, the profinite completion of the fundamental group of a mixed 3-manifold, together with the peripheral structure, uniquely determines the homeomorphism type of its Seifert part (i.e. the maximal graph manifold components in the JSJ-decomposition). On the other hand, without assigning the peripheral structure, the profinite completion of a mixed 3- manifold group may not even determine the fundamental group of its Seifert part. The proof is based on JSJ-decomposition.</description>

      <title>Clock Moves and Alexander Polynomial of Plane Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16126v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of clock moves for spanning trees in plane graphs. This enables us to develop a spanning tree model of an Alexander polynomial for a plane graph and prove the unimodal property of its associate coefficient sequence. In particular, this confirms the trapezoidal conjecture for planar singular knots and gives new insights to Fox's original conjecture on alternating knots.</description>

      <title>The Pants Graph of a Rose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a pants decomposition for a rose, where a rose is defined as a wedge sum of finitely many circles, and construct the corresponding pants graph of a rose. A pants decomposition of a rose leads to the formation of a simplicial graph, referred to as the pants graph of a rose, consisting of all possible pants decompositions. Recall that the outer automorphism group of a free group is isomorphic to the group of homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences of a rose. The natural isometric action of this group on the pants graph induces a coarsely Lipschitz orbit map. Additionally, we construct a coarsely Lipschitz map from the pants graph to the free splitting complex. These results imply that the pants graph of a rose is both connected and unbounded.</description>

      <title>Quantiles and Quantile Regression on Riemannian Manifolds: a measure-transportation-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increased attention has been given recently to the statistical analysis of variables with values on nonlinear manifolds. A natural but nontrivial problem in that context is the definition of quantile concepts. We are proposing a solution for compact Riemannian manifolds without boundaries; typical examples are polyspheres, hyperspheres, and toro\"{\i}dal manifolds equipped with their Riemannian metrics. Our concept of quantile function comes along with a concept of distribution function and, in the empirical case, ranks and signs. The absence of a canonical ordering is offset by resorting to the data-driven ordering induced by optimal transports. Theoretical properties, such as the uniform convergence of the empirical distribution and conditional (and unconditional) quantile functions and distribution-freeness of ranks and signs, are established. Statistical inference applications, from goodness-of-fit to distribution-free rank-based testing, are without number. Of particular importance is the case of quantile regression with directional or toro\"{\i}dal multiple output, which is given special attention in this paper. Extensive simulations are carried out to illustrate these novel concepts.</description>

      <title>Legendrian non-isotopic unit conormal bundles in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any compact connected submanifold $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, let $\Lambda_K$ denote its unit conormal bundle, which is a Legendrian submanifold of the unit cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this paper, we give examples of pairs $(K_0,K_1)$ of compact connected submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\Lambda_{K_0}$ is not Legendrian isotopic to $\Lambda_{K_1}$, although they cannot be distinguished by classical invariants. Here, $K_1$ is the image of an embedding $\iota_f \colon K_0 \to \mathbb{R}^n$ which is regular homotopic to the inclusion map of $K_0$ and the codimension in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is greater than or equal to $4$. As non-classical invariants, we define the strip Legendrian contact homology and a coproduct on it under certain conditions on Legendrian submanifolds. Then, we give a purely topological description of these invariants for $\Lambda_K$ when the codimension of $K$ is greater than or equal to $4$. The main examples $\Lambda_{K_0}$ and $\Lambda_{K_1}$ are distinguished by the coproduct, which is computed by using an idea of string topology.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed orientable $(n-1)$-connected $(2n+2)$-manifold, $n\geq 2$. In this paper we combine the Postnikov tower of spheres and the homotopy decomposition of the reduced suspension space $\Sigma M$ to investigate the cohomotopy sets $\pi^\ast(M)$ for $n=2,3,4$, under the assumption that $M$ has $2$-torsion-free homology. All cohomotopy sets $\pi^i(M)$ of such manifolds $M$ are characterized except $\pi^4(M)$ for $n=3,4$.</description>

      <title>Locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact, connected manifold of positive dimension and let $\mathcal G\leq\textrm{Homeo}(M)$ be \emph{locally approximating} in the sense that for all open $U\subseteq M$ compactly contained in a single Euclidean chart of $M$, the subgroup $\mathcal G[U]$ consisting of elements of $\mathcal G$ supported in $U$ is dense in the full group of homeomorphisms supported in $U$. We prove that $\mathcal G$ interprets first order arithmetic, as well as a first order predicate that encodes membership in finitely generated subgroups of $\mathcal G$. As a consequence, we show that if $\mathcal G$ is not finitely generated, then no group elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ can be finitely generated. We show that many finitely generated locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms $\mathcal G$ of a manifold are prime models of their theories, and give conditions that guarantee any finitely presented group $G$ that is elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal G$. We thus recover some results of Lasserre about the model theory of Thompson's groups $F$ and $T$. Finally, we obtain several action rigidity result for locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms. If $\mathcal G$ acts in a locally approximating way on a compact, connected manifold $M$ then the dimension of $M$ is uniquely determined by the elementary equivalence class of $\mathcal G$. Moreover, if $\dim M\leq 3$ then $M$ is uniquely determined up to homeomorphism. In for general closed smooth manifolds, the homotopy type of $M$ is uniquely determined. In this way, we obtain a generalization of a well-known result of Rubin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of oriented manifolds with boundaries called the forest biassociahedra and forest bimultiplihedra, generalizing the standard biassociahedra. They are defined as moduli spaces of ascending-descending biforests and are expected to act as parameter spaces for operations defined on Morse and Floer chains in the context of compact Lie group actions.
  We study the structure of their boundary, and derive some algebraic notions of ``$f$-bialgebras'', as well as related notions of bimodules, morphisms and categories. This allows us to state some conjectures describing compact Lie group actions on Morse and Floer chains, and on Fukaya categories.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Freedman [arXiv:2301.00295] introduced the idea of packing a maximal number of links into a bounded region subject to geometric constraints, and produced upper bounds on the packing number in some cases, while commenting that these bounds seemed far too large. We show that the smallest of these "extravagantly large" bounds is in fact sharp by constructing, for any link, a packing of exponentially many copies as a function of the available volume. We also produce improved and generalized upper bounds.</description>

Abstract: In this expository note, we explore the possibility of the existence of Kirby move of type 1 for contact surgery diagrams. In particular, we give the necessary conditions on a contact surgery diagram to become a potential candidate for contact Kirby move of type 1. We observe that there is a collection of contact positive integral surgery diagrams on Legendrian unknots satisfying those conditions.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Anosov flows from infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every pseudo-Anosov flow $\phi$ in a closed $3$-manifold $M$ gives rise to an action of $\pi_1(M)$ on a circle $S^{1}_{\infty}(\phi)$ from infinity \cite{Fen12}, with a pair of invariant \emph{almost} laminations. From certain actions on $S^{1}$ with invariant almost laminations, we reconstruct flows and manifolds realizing these actions, including all orientable transitive pseudo-Anosov flows in closed $3$-manifolds. Our construction provides a geometry model for such flows and manifolds induced from $\mathcal{D} \times \mathcal{D}$, where $\mathcal{D}$ is the Poincar\'e disk with $\partial \mathcal{D}$ identified with $S^{1}_{\infty}(\phi)$. In addition, our result applies to Cannon conjecture under the assumption that certain group-equivariant sphere-filling Peano curve exists, which offers a description of orientable quasigeodesic pseudo-Anosov flows in hyperbolic $3$-manifolds in terms of group actions on $\partial \mathbb{H}^{3} \times \partial \mathbb{H}^{3} \times \partial \mathbb{H}^{3}$.</description>

      <title>Volumes, Lorenz-like templates, and braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we find a more straightforward problem that is equivalent to one of the major challenges in knot theory: the classification of links in the 3-sphere. More precisely, we provide a simpler braid description for all links in the 3-sphere in terms of generalised T-links. With this, we translate the problem of classifying links in the 3-sphere into a problem of counting the number of generalised T-links that represent the same link. Generalised T-links are a natural generalisation of twisted torus links and Lorenz links, two families of links that have been extensively studied by many people. Moreover, we generalise the bunch algorithm to construct links embedded in universal Lorenz-like templates and provide an upper volume bound that is quadratic in the trip number. We use the upper bound obtained from the generalised bunch algorithm for generalised T-links to establish an upper bound for the sum of the volumes of the hyperbolic pieces of all closed, orientable, connected 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Weyl problem for unbounded convex domains in $\HH^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.02101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K\subset \HH^3$ be a convex subset in $\HH^3$ with smooth, strictly convex boundary. The induced metric on $\partial K$ then has curvature $K&gt;-1$. It was proved by Alexandrov that if $K$ is bounded, then it is uniquely determined by the induced metric on the boundary, and any smooth metric with curvature $K&gt;-1$ can be obtained.
  We propose here an extension of the existence part of this result to unbounded convex domains in $\HH^3$. The induced metric on $\partial K$ is then clearly not sufficient to determine $K$. However one can consider a richer data on the boundary including the ideal boundary of $K$. Specifically, we consider the data composed of the full conformal structure on the boundary of $K$ (in the Poincar\'e model of $\HH^3$), together with the induced metric on $\partial K$. We show that a wide range of "reasonable" data of this type, satisfying mild curvature conditions, can be realized on the boundary of a convex subset in $\HH^3$.</description>

      <title>Generic doubling of rectangular pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13209v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a multiplicity result for rectangular pegs that there is a generic class of smooth Jordan curves in which every curve admits two geometrically distinct similar inscribed rectangles with aspect angle in (0,\frac{\pi}{2}), based on the existence of rectangular pegs in any smooth Jordan curve, which is first proved by Greene and Lobb [GL21] and we give an alternative Floer theoretical proof in this paper. The key insight is that the rectangular peg problem is translated into finding intersection points of two Lagrangian tori. We present two distinct proofs for the multiplicity result: one involves Lagrangian Floer homology, and the other is differential topological in nature which employs a novel computation formula for the algebraic intersection number. Both rely crucially on certain generic geometric transversality of the two tori, and the correspondence between the intersection points and the inscribed rectangles. Moreover, such a generic doubling result can be further extended to cyclic quadrilateral pegs based on the existence result [GL23]. In Appendix \ref{Appendix_B}, written jointly with Urs Frauenfelder, we provide the detailed derivation of this computation formula.</description>

      <title>A classification of semi-equivelar gems of PL $d$-manifolds on the surface with Euler characteristic $-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A semi-equivelar gem of a PL $d$-manifold is a regular colored graph that represents the PL $d$-manifold and regularly embeds on a surface, with the property that the cyclic sequence of degrees of faces in the embedding around each vertex is identical. In \cite{bb24}, the authors classified semi-equivelar gems of PL $d$-manifolds embedded on surfaces with Euler characteristics greater than or equal to zero. In this article, we focus on classifying semi-equivelar gems of PL $d$-manifolds embedded on the surface with Euler characteristic $-1$. We prove that if a semi-equivelar gem embeds regularly on the surface with Euler characteristic $-1$, then it belongs to one of the following types: $(8^3), (6^2,8), (6^2,12), (10^2,4), (12^2,4),$ $ (4,6,14), (4,6,16), (4,6,18), (4,6,24), (4,8,10), (4,8,12),$ or $(4,8,16)$. Furthermore, we provide constructions that demonstrate the existence of such gems for each of the aforementioned types.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of cluster algebras of type $A_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Okounkov [Oko03] conjectured the log-concavity about the structure constants for many interesting basis from representation theory. For the cluster algebra, Gross, Hacking, Keel, Kontsevich [GHKK18] introduced the atomic theta basis. We prove that the coefficients of the exponents of any cluster variable of type $A_n$ are log-concave. We show that the structure constants for theta basis of type $A_2$ are log-concave. As for larger generality, we conjecture that the log-concavity of the structure constants for theta basis of the cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Classification of Horikawa surfaces with T-singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify all projective surfaces with only T-singularities, $K^2=2p_g-4$, and ample canonical class. In this way, we identify all surfaces, smoothable or not, with only T-singularities in the Koll\'ar--Shepherd-Barron--Alexeev (KSBA) moduli space of Horikawa surfaces. We also prove that they are not smoothable when $p_g \geq 10$, except for the Lee-Park (Fintushel-Stern) examples, which we show to have only one deformation type unless $p_g=6$ (in which case they have two). This demonstrates that the challenging Horikawa problem cannot be addressed through complex T-degenerations, and we propose new questions regarding diffeomorphism types based on our classification. Furthermore, the techniques developed in this paper enable us to classify all KSBA surfaces with only T-singularities and $K^2=2p_g-3$, e.g. quintic surfaces and I-surfaces.</description>
