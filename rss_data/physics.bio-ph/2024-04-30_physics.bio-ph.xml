      <title>Magnetic control of magnetotactic bacteria swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are of significant fundamental and practical interest, especially for applications such as drug delivery and general-purpose object manipulators and payload carriers. While magnetic and other modes of control for individual MTB have been demonstrated, formation, motion and control of MTB swarms are much less studied and understood. Here, we present a torque dipole-based theoretical model for magnetic control of MTB swarms and two methods for swarm formation, and provide experimental validation of the proposed motion model. Model predictions are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiments and literature. Additionally, we were able to determine the torque generated by Magnetospirillium gryphiswaldense (MSR-1) MTB, and the value corresponds to the reported estimates reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Advanced analysis of single-molecule spectroscopic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Full SMS, a multipurpose graphical user interface (GUI)-based software package for analysing single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS) data. SMS typically delivers multiparameter data -- such as fluorescence brightness, lifetime, and spectra -- of molecular- or nanometre-scale particles such as single dye molecules, quantum dots, or fluorescently labelled biological macromolecules. Full SMS allows an unbiased statistical analysis of fluorescence brightness through level resolution and clustering, analysis of fluorescence lifetimes through decay fitting, as well as the calculation of second-order correlation functions and the display of fluorescence spectra and raster-scan images. Additional features include extensive data filtering options, a custom HDF5-based file format, and flexible data export options. The software is open source and written in Python but GUI-based so it may be used without any programming knowledge. A multi-process architecture was employed for computational efficiency. The software is also designed to be easily extendable to include additional import data types and analysis capabilities.</description>

      <title>Polymer Collapse and Liquid-Liquid Phase-Separation are Coupled in a Generalized Prewetting Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional organization of chromatin is thought to play an important role in controlling gene expression. Specificity in expression is achieved through the interaction of transcription factors and other nuclear proteins with particular sequences of DNA. At unphysiological concentrations many of these nuclear proteins can phase-separate in the absence of DNA, and it has been hypothesized that, in vivo, the thermodynamic forces driving these phases help determine chromosomal organization. However it is unclear how DNA, itself a long polymer subject to configurational transitions, interacts with three-dimensional protein phases. Here we show that a long compressible polymer can be coupled to interacting protein mixtures, leading to a generalized prewetting transition where polymer collapse is coincident with a locally stabilized liquid droplet. We use lattice Monte-Carlo simulations and a mean-field theory to show that these phases can be stable even in regimes where both polymer collapse and coexisting liquid phases are unstable in isolation, and that these new transitions can be either abrupt or continuous. For polymers with internal linear structure we further show that changes in the concentration of bulk components can lead to changes in three-dimensional polymer structure. In the nucleus there are many distinct proteins that interact with many different regions of chromatin, potentially giving rise to many different Prewet phases. The simple systems we consider here highlight chromatin's role as a lower-dimensional surface whose interactions with proteins are required for these novel phases.</description>

      <title>Morphodynamics of chloroplast network control light-avoidance response in the non-motile dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosynthetic algae play a significant role in oceanic carbon capture. Their performance, however, is constantly challenged by fluctuations in environmental light conditions. Here, we show that the non-motile single-celled marine dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula can internally contract its chloroplast network in response to light. By exposing the cell to various physiological light conditions and applying temporal illumination sequences, we find that network morphodynamics follows simple rules, as established in a mathematical model. Our analysis of the chloroplast structure reveals that its unusual reticulated morphology constitutes properties similar to auxetic metamaterials, facilitating drastic deformations for light-avoidance, while confined by the cell wall. Our study shows how the topologically complex network of chloroplasts is crucial in supporting the dinoflagellate's adaptation to varying light conditions, thereby facilitating essential life-sustaining processes.</description>

      <title>Fast and label-free 3D virtual H&amp;E histology via active modulation-assisted dynamic full-field OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathological features are the gold standard for tumor diagnosis, guiding treatment and prognosis. However, standard histopathological process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, while frozen sections have lower accuracy. Dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (D-FFOCT) offers rapid histologic information by measuring the subcellular dynamics of fresh, unprocessed tissues. However, D-FFOCT images suffer from abrupt shifts in hue and brightness, which is confusing for pathologists and diminish their interpretability and reliability. Here, we present active phase modulation-assisted D-FFOCT (APMD-FFOCT) to improve the imaging stability and enhance the contrast of static tissues. This enables us to further employ an unsupervised deep learning to convert APMD-FFOCT images into virtual hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained images for the first time. Three-dimensional (3D) virtual H&amp;E-stained images have been obtained at a scanning rate of 1 frame per second, as demonstrated in cancer diagnosis for human central nervous system and breast. The results prove that this new method will play a unique and important role in intraoperative histology.</description>

      <title>Intraspecific predator interference promotes biodiversity in ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05098v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explaining biodiversity is a fundamental issue in ecology. A long-standing puzzle lies in the paradox of the plankton: many species of plankton feeding on a limited variety of resources coexist, apparently flouting the competitive exclusion principle (CEP), which holds that the number of predator (consumer) species cannot exceed that of the resources at a steady state. Here, we present a mechanistic model and demonstrate that intraspecific interference among the consumers enables a plethora of consumer species to coexist at constant population densities with only one or a handful of resource species. This facilitated biodiversity is resistant to stochasticity, either with the stochastic simulation algorithm or individual-based modeling. Our model naturally explains the classical experiments that invalidate the CEP, quantitatively illustrates the universal S-shaped pattern of the rank-abundance curves across a wide range of ecological communities, and can be broadly used to resolve the mystery of biodiversity in many natural ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Identifying heterogeneous micromechanical properties of biological tissues via physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneous micromechanical properties of biological tissues have profound implications across diverse medical and engineering domains. However, identifying the full-field heterogeneous elastic properties of soft materials using traditional computational and engineering approaches is fundamentally challenging due to difficulties in estimating local stress fields. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using data-driven models to learn full-field mechanical responses such as displacement and strain from experimental or synthetic data. However, research studies on inferring the full-field elastic properties of materials, a more challenging problem, are scarce, particularly for large deformation, hyperelastic materials. Here, we propose a physics-informed machine learning approach to identify the elastic modulus distribution in nonlinear, large deformation hyperelastic materials. We evaluate the prediction accuracies and computational efficiency of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) on inferring the heterogeneous material parameter maps across three nonlinear materials with structural complexity that closely resemble real tissue patterns, such as brain tissue and tricuspid valve tissue. Our improved PINN architecture accurately estimates the full-field elastic properties of three hyperelastic constitutive models, with relative errors of less than 5% across all examples. This research has significant potential for advancing our understanding of micromechanical behaviors in biological materials, impacting future innovations in engineering and medicine.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>
