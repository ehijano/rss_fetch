      <title>Phonon-driven multipolar dynamics in spin-orbit coupled Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by ongoing work on pump-probe experiments and Floquet driven magnets, we theoretically study the impact of pumped and driven Einstein phonons with weak dissipation in multipolar Mott insulators. For Mott insulators with pseudospin-$1/2$ non-Kramers doublets hosting octupolar and quadrupolar moments, we show that pumping the ${\cal E}_g$ phonon modes which couple linearly to the quadrupoles leads to characteristic chiral phonon dynamics below the octupolar ordering transition. We also explore steady states in the presence of continuously driven phonons, showing that a coherent two-phonon drive with a suitable phase choice can be used to 'train' octupolar order or even switch its sign. For spin-$1$ magnets, which host dipolar and quadrupolar moments, we show that one-phonon and two-phonon drives can generate Floquet flavor-wave excitations and induce dipolar magnetization. Our results are obtained using a generalized $SU(N)$ Monte Carlo for the multipolar degrees of freedom with numerical integration of the coupled spin-phonon equations of motion. Our work opens up pathways to explore phonon-driven dynamics in multipolar magnets.</description>

      <title>Charge density-waves with non-trivial orbital textures in rare earth tritellurides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments reporting unconventional collective modes in the charge density-wave (CDW) state of rare-earth tritellurides $R$Te$_3$, we derive from a multi-orbital microscopic model on the square net a CDW Ginzburg-Landau theory that allows for non-trivial orbital order. Our analysis reveals unconventional CDWs where order parameters with distinct orbital character coexist due to an approximate symmetry of the low-energy model, which becomes exact in the limit of nearest-neighbor-only hopping and decoupled $p_x$, $p_y$ orbitals. Because of this coexistence, the resulting CDW pattern displays an orbital texture that generally breaks additional symmetries of the lattice besides those explicitly broken by the CDW wave-vector. In particular, we find two competing phases that differ in whether they break or preserve inversion and vertical mirror symmetries. We explain the mechanisms that favor each outcome, and discuss experimental probes that can distinguish the different phases.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent Hartree theory for lattice-relaxed magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For twisted bilayer graphene close to magic angle, we show that the effects of lattice relaxation and the Hartree interaction both become simultaneously important. Including both effects in a continuum theory reveals a Lifshitz transition to a Fermi surface topology that supports both a ``heavy fermion" pocket and an ultraflat band ($\approx 8~{\rm meV}$) that is pinned to the Fermi energy for a large range of fillings. We provide analytical and numerical results to understand the narrow ``magic angle range" that supports this pinned ultraflat band and make predictions for its experimental observation. We believe that the bands presented here are accurate at high temperature and provide a good starting point to understand the myriad of complex behaviour observed in this system.</description>

      <title>Topological Origin of Floquet Thermalization in Periodically Driven Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering is a powerful manipulation method in modern quantum technology. However, unwanted heating is the main challenge of Floquet engineering, therefore the Floquet thermalization has attracting considerable attentions recently. In this work, we investigate thermalization of periodically driven many-body systems through the lens of Krylov complexity, and find a topological origin of different thermalization behaviors. We demonstrate that If the topology of the Krylov chain is nontrivial, a periodically driven system will reach a state with finite temperature. When the Krylov chain is topologically trivial, the system will be heated to infinite temperature. We further show that the prethermalization can be understood as the tunnelling process of a quasi-edge mode through the local gap on Krylov chain. This picture provides a systematically method to obtain the effective prethermal Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin density wave orders in field-biased Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to clarify the nature of a surprising ordered phase recently reported in biased Bernal bilayer graphene that occurs at the phase boundary between the isospin-polarized and unpolarized phases. Strong nonlinearity of transport at abnormally small currents, with $dI/dV$ vs. $I$ sharply rising and then falling back, is typical for a charge/spin-density-wave state (CDW or SDW) sliding transport. Here, however, it is observed at an isospin-order phase boundary, prompting a question about the CDW/SDW mechanism and its relation to the quantum critical point. We argue that the observed phase diagram cannot be understood within a standard weak-coupling picture. Rather, it points to a mechanism that relies on an effective interaction enhancement at a quantum critical point. We develop a detailed strong-coupling framework accounting for the soft collective modes that explain these observations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phase diagram of EuPdSn_2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetic phase diagram for EuPdSn_2 is constructed based on magnetization, DC-susceptibility and specific heat as a function of applied field, and neutron diffraction results at zero field. The contribution of the ferromagnetic FM and antiferromagnetic AFM components to the measured magnetic susceptibility can be separated and weighted as a function of the applied field B by taking the temperature dependence of the neutron counts from the FM phase at B=0 as a reference. In the magnetically ordered phase, the temperature dependence of the specific heat does not follow the mean-field prediction for the Eu^{2+} J=7/2 quantum number rather that for J=5/2. This deviation and the consequent discrepancy for the entropy is discussed in the context of a non-Zeeman distribution of the eight fold ground state. Comparing the respective variations of magnetization M(T,B) and entropy S(T,B), the thermodynamic relationship dM/dT=dS/dB=0 is observed for the ranges: 0&lt;T&lt;10K and 0&lt;B&lt;0.4T.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement in a pure state of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative entropy. We apply them to the single impurity Anderson model where the most basic Kondo effect is manifested, and obtain new insights into the Kondo effect there. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning the BCS-BEC crossover of electron-hole pairing with pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In graphite, a moderate magnetic field confines electrons and holes into their lowest Landau levels. In the extreme quantum limit, two insulating states with a dome-like field dependence of the their critical temperatures are induced by the magnetic field. Here, we study the evolution of the first dome (below 60 T) under hydrostatic pressure up to 1.7 GPa. With increasing pressure, the field-temperature phase boundary shifts towards higher magnetic fields, yet the maximum critical temperature remains unchanged. According to our fermiology data, pressure amplifies the density and the effective mass of hole-like and electron-like carriers. Thanks to this information, we verify the persistent relevance of the BCS relation between the critical temperature and the density of states in the weak-coupling boundary of the dome. In contrast, the strong-coupling summit of the dome does not show any detectable change with pressure. We argue that this is because the out-of-plane BCS coherence length approaches the interplane distance that shows little change with pressure. Thus, the BCS-BEC crossover is tunable by magnetic field and pressure, but with a locked summit.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced insulator-metal transition in paramagnetic (V$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$)$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-probe experiments with femtosecond time resolution allow to disentangle the electronic dynamics from the lattice response and thus provide valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of correlated materials. In Cr-doped V$_2$O$_3$, a multi-orbital Mott-Hubbard material which has been intensively investigated for decades, time-resolved experiments reported a photo-induced insulator-metal transition leading to a transient metal state with nonthermal properties. Here, we combine non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory with realistic first principles modeling to simulate the ultrafast response of this material to a laser excitation. Our calculations reproduce the insulating initial state, with orbital occupations in agreement with experiment, and reveal an ultrafast pump-induced gap filling associated with a charge reshuffling between the $e_g^\pi$ and $a_{1g}$ orbitals. However, in contrast to the related compound VO$_2$, the electronic system thermalizes within a few tens of femtoseconds and we find no evidence for the existence of a metastable nonthermal metal. This suggests that the reported nonthermal behavior in the experiments may be associated with the mismatch between the electronic and lattice temperatures.</description>

      <title>Tunable quasi-discrete spectrum of spin waves excited by periodic laser patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a concept for selective excitation of magnetostatic surface waves with quasi-discrete spectrum using spatially patterned femtosecond laser pulses inducing either ultrafast change of magnetic anisotropy or inverse Faraday effect. We micromagnetically simulate excitation of the waves with periodically patterned uni- or bipolar laser impact. Such excitation yields multiple wavepackets propagating with different group velocities, whose dispersion corresponds to the set of quasi-discrete points. In addition, we show that the frequency of the spectral peaks can be controlled by the polarity of the periodic impact and its spatial period. Presented consideration of multiple spatially periodic SW sources as a whole enables implementation of a comprehensive toolkit of spatio-temporal optical methods for tunable SW excitation and control of its parameters.</description>

      <title>Enhanced torque efficiency in ferromagnetic multilayers by introducing naturally oxidized Cu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) in the heavy elements with a large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been frequently used to manipulate the magnetic states in spintronic devices. Recent theoretical works have predicted that the surface oxidized light elements with a negligible SOC can yield a sizable orbital torque (OT), which plays an important role in switching the magnetization. Here, we report anomalous-Hall-resistance and harmonic-Hall-voltage measurements on perpendicularly magnetized Ta/Cu/[Ni/Co]$_5$/Cu-CuO$_x$ multilayers. Both torque efficiency and spin-Hall angle of these multilayers are largely enhanced by introducing a naturally oxidized Cu-CuO$_x$ layer, where the SOC is negligible. Such an enhancement is mainly due to the collaborative driven of the SOT from the Ta layer and the OT from the Cu/CuO$_x$ interface, and can be tuned by controlling the thickness of Cu-CuO$_x$ layer. Compared to the Cu-CuO$_x$-free multilayers, the maximum torque efficiency and spin-Hall angle were enhanced by a factor of ten, larger than most of the reported values in the other heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement/deconfinement, captivating attributes of high-energy elementary particles, have recently garnered wide attention in quantum simulations based on cold atoms. Yet, the partial confinement, an intermediate state between the confinement and deconfinement, remains underexplored. The partial confinement encapsulates the phenomenon that the confining behavior of charged particles is contingent upon their relative positions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the spin-1 quantum link model provides an excellent platform for exploring partial confinement. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of the physics emerging from partial confinement in both the context of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics. Potential experimental setups using cold atoms are also discussed. Our work offers a simple and feasible routine for the study of confinement-related physics in the state-of-the-art artificial quantum systems subject to gauge symmetries.</description>

      <title>Uncovering an Interfacial Band Resulting from Orbital Hybridization in Nickelate Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of atomic orbitals at the interface of perovskite oxide heterostructures has been investigated for its profound impact on the band structures and electronic properties, giving rise to unique electronic states and a variety of tunable functionalities. In this study, we conducted an extensive investigation of the optical and electronic properties of epitaxial NdNiO3 thin films grown on a series of single crystal substrates. Unlike films synthesized on other substrates, NdNiO3 on SrTiO3 (NNO/STO) gives rise to a unique band structure which features an additional unoccupied band situated above the Fermi level. Our comprehensive investigation, which incorporated a wide array of experimental techniques and density functional theory calculations, revealed that the emergence of the interfacial band structure is primarily driven by the orbital hybridization between Ti 3d orbitals of the STO substrate and O 2p orbitals of the NNO thin film. Furthermore, exciton peaks have been detected in the optical spectra of the NNO/STO film, attributable to the pronounced electron-electron (e-e) and electron-hole (e-h) interactions propagating from the STO substrate into the NNO film. These findings underscore the substantial influence of interfacial orbital hybridization on the electronic structure of oxide thin-films, thereby offering key insights into tuning their interfacial properties.</description>

      <title>Qubit encoding for a mixture of localized functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the crucial generic techniques for quantum computation is the amplitude encoding. Although such techniques have been proposed, each of them often requires exponential classical-computational cost or an oracle whose explicit construction is not provided. Given the recent demands for practical quantum computation, we develop moderately specialized encoding techniques that generate an arbitrary linear combination of localized complex functions. We demonstrate that $n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ discrete Lorentzian functions as an expansion basis set lead to efficient probabilistic encoding, whose computational time is $\mathcal{O} ( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_{\mathrm{loc}}, n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_q, n_q \log n_q ))$ for $n_q$ data qubits equipped with $\log_2 n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ ancillae. Furthermore, amplitude amplification in combination with amplitude reduction renders it deterministic with controllable errors and the computational time is reduced to $\mathcal{O} ( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_{\mathrm{loc}}, n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_q, n_q \log n_q )).$ We provide estimation of required resources for application of our scheme to quantum chemistry in real space. We also show the results on real superconducting quantum computers to confirm the validity of our techniques.</description>

      <title>A general framework for active space embedding methods: applications in quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a general framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing of molecular and periodic embedding calculations based on an orbital space separation of the fragment and environment degrees of freedom. We show its potential by presenting a specific implementation of periodic range-separated DFT coupled to a quantum circuit ansatz, whereby the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum equation-of-motion approach are used to obtain the low-lying spectrum of the embedded fragment Hamiltonian. Application of this scheme to study strongly correlated molecular systems and localized electronic states in materials is showcased through the accurate prediction of the optical properties for the neutral oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide (MgO). Despite some discrepancies in absorption predictions, the method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art ab initio approaches, particularly evidenced by the accurate prediction of the photoluminescence emission peak.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between entanglement and non-stabilizerness (also known as magic) in matrix product states (MPSs). We study the relation between magic and the bond dimension used to approximate the ground state of a many-body system in two different contexts: full state of magic and mutual magic (the non-stabilizer analogue of mutual information, thus free of boundary effects) of spin-1 anisotropic Heisenberg chains. Our results indicate that obtaining converged results for non-stabilizerness is typically considerably easier than entanglement. For full state magic at critical points and at sufficiently large volumes, we observe convergence with $1/\chi^2$, with $\chi$ being the MPS bond dimension. At small volumes, magic saturation is so quick that, within error bars, we cannot appreciate any finite-$\chi$ correction. Mutual magic also shows a fast convergence with bond dimension, whose specific functional form is however hindered by sampling errors. As a by-product of our study, we show how Pauli-Markov chains (originally formulated to evaluate magic) resets the state of the art in terms of computing mutual information for MPS. We illustrate this last fact by verifying the logarithmic increase of mutual information between connected partitions at critical points. By comparing mutual information and mutual magic, we observe that, for connected partitions, the latter is typically scaling much slower - if at all - with the partition size, while for disconnected partitions, both are constant in size.</description>

      <title>Spin coupling is all you need: Encoding strong electron correlation on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of quantum algorithms for eigenvalue problems, such as computing Hamiltonian spectra, depends strongly on the overlap of the initial wavefunction and the target eigenvector. In a basis of Slater determinants, the representation of energy eigenstates of systems with $N$ strongly correlated electrons requires a number of determinants that scales exponentially with $N$. On classical processors, this restricts simulations to systems where $N$ is small. Here, we show that quantum computers can efficiently simulate strongly correlated molecular systems by directly encoding the dominant entanglement structure in the form of spin-coupled initial states. This avoids resorting to expensive classical or quantum state preparation heuristics and instead exploits symmetries in the wavefunction. We provide quantum circuits for deterministic preparation of a family of spin eigenfunctions with ${N \choose N/2}$ Slater determinants with depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ local gates. Their use as highly entangled initial states in quantum algorithms reduces the total runtime of quantum phase estimation and related fault-tolerant methods by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we assess the application of spin-coupled wavefunctions as initial states for a range of heuristic quantum algorithms, namely the variational quantum eigensolver, adiabatic state preparation, and different versions of quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) including QSD based on real-time-evolved states. We also propose a novel QSD algorithm that exploits states obtained through adaptive quantum eigensolvers. For all algorithms, we demonstrate that using spin-coupled initial states drastically reduces the quantum resources required to simulate strongly correlated ground and excited states. Our work paves the way towards scalable quantum simulation of electronic structure for classically challenging systems.</description>

      <title>Anomaly and invertible field theory with higher-form symmetry: Extended group cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of invertible symmetry, the topological approach based on classifying spaces dominates the classification of 't Hooft anomalies and symmetry protected topological phases. In contrast, except for discrete 0-form symmetry, a systematic algebraic approach based on cochains remains poorly explored. In this work, we investigate the systematic algebraic approach for discrete higher-form symmetry with a trivial higher-group structure. Studying the discrete formulation of invertible field theories in arbitrary dimension, we extract a purely algebraic structure that we call extended group cohomology, which directly characterizes and classifies the lattice lagrangian of invertible field theories and the behavior of anomalous topological operators. Using techniques from simplicial homotopy theory, we prove the isomorphism between extended group cohomology and cohomology of classifying spaces. The proof is based on an explicit construction of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces and their products. Our findings also clarify the discrete formulation of a class of generalized Dijkgraaf-Witten-Yetter models.</description>

      <title>Tunable exciton valley-pseudospin orders in moir\'e Bose-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin and charge are the two most important degrees of freedom of electrons. Their interplay lies at the heart of numerous strongly correlated phenomena including Hubbard model physics and high temperature superconductivity. Such interplay for bosons, on the other hand, is largely unexplored in condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate a unique realization of the spin-1/2 Bose-Hubbard model through excitons in a semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. We find evidence of a transient in-plane ferromagnetic (FM-$xy$) order of exciton spin - here valley pseudospin - around exciton filling $\nu_{ex}$ = 1, which transitions into a FM-$z$ order both with increasing exciton filling and a small magnetic field of 10 mT. The phase diagram is different from the fermion case and is qualitatively captured by a simple phenomenological model, highlighting the unique consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics. Our study paves the way for engineering exotic phases of matter from spinor bosons, as well as for unconventional devices in optics and quantum information science.</description>

Abstract: We present experimental evidence that a heavy Fermi surface consisting of itinerant, charge-neutral spinons underpins both heavy-fermion-strange-metal (without f electrons) and quantum-spin-liquid states in the 4d-electron trimer lattice, Ba4Nb1-xRu3+xO12 (|x| &lt; 0.20). These two exotic states both exhibit an extraordinarily large entropy, a linear heat capacity extending into the milli-Kelvin regime, a linear thermal conductivity at low temperatures, and separation of charges and spins. Furthermore, the insulating spin liquid is a much better thermal conductor than the heavy-fermion-strange-metal that separately is observed to strongly violate the Wiedemann-Franz law. We propose that at the heart of this 4d system is a universal, heavy spinon Fermi surface that provides a unified framework for explaining the exotic phenomena observed throughout the entire series. The control of such exotic ground states provided by variable Nb concentration offers a new paradigm for studies of correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergent gauge theories take a prominent role in the description of quantum matter, supporting deconfined phases with topological order and fractionalized excitations. A common construction of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, first introduced by Wegner, involves Ising gauge spins placed on links and subject to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Gauss law constraint. As shown by Kitaev, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories also emerge in the exact solution of certain spin systems with bond-dependent interactions. In this context, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field is constructed from Majorana fermions, with gauge constraints given by the parity of Majorana fermions on each site. In this work, we provide an explicit Jordan-Wigner transformation that maps between these two formulations on the square lattice, where the Kitaev-type gauge theory emerges as the exact solution of a spin-orbital (Kugel-Khomskii) Hamiltonian. We then apply our mapping to study local perturbations to the spin-orbital Hamiltonian, which correspond to anisotropic interactions between electric-field variables in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. These are shown to induce anisotropic confinement that is characterized by emergence of weakly-coupled one-dimensional spin chains. We study the nature of these phases and corresponding confinement transitions in both absence and presence of itinerant fermionic matter degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss how our mapping can be applied to the Kitaev spin-1/2 model on the honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Enriched Criticality in a Coupled Spin-Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional ladder of two coupled XXZ spin chains and identify several distinct gapless symmetry-enriched critical phases. These have the same unbroken symmetries and long-wavelength description, but cannot be connected without encountering either a phase transition or other intermediate phases. Using bosonizaion, we analyze the nature of their distinction by determining how microscopic symmetries are manifested in the long-wavelength fields, the behavior of charged local and nonlocal operators, and identify the universality class of all direct continuous phase transitions between them. One of these phases is a gapless topological phase with protected edge modes. We characterize its precise nature and place it within the broader classification. We also find the occurrence of `multiversality' in the phase diagram, wherein two fixed phases are separated by continuous transitions with different universality classes in different parameter regimes. We determine the phase diagram and all its aspects, as well as verify our predictions numerically using density matrix renormalization group and a mapping onto an effective spin-1 model.</description>

      <title>Ground state of the staggered Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ honeycomb model in a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ground state properties of the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ staggered Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ honeycomb model under a magnetic field based on analytical and numerical methods. Our calculations show that the conventional zigzag and stripy phases are favored because of the staggered Heisenberg interaction away from the pure $\Gamma$ limit. In our classical analysis, we find that the field induces a series of competing magnetic phases with relatively large unit cells in the region sandwiched between the two magnetic phases with long-range ordering. In the quantum treatment, these large magnetic unit cells are destabilized by strong quantum fluctuations that result in the stabilization of a gapless quantum spin liquid behavior. In a honeycomb $\Gamma$ magnet, we disclose an intermediate-field gapless quantum spin liquid phase driven by a tilted field away from the out-of-plane direction only for a narrow region between the low-field zigzag and high-field fully polarized phases.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective Superconductivity in the Pressurized Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: An Infinite Projected Entangled-Pair State Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The newly discovered high-$T_c$ nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has generated significant research interest. To uncover the pairing mechanism, it is essential to investigate the intriguing interplay between the two $e_g$, i.e., $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Here we perform an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) study of the bilayer $t$-$J$ model, directly in the thermodynamic limit and with orbitally selective parameters for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, respectively. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons exhibit significant intralayer hopping $t_\parallel$ and spin couplings $J_\parallel$, with interlayer $J_\perp$ passed from the $d_{z^2}$ electrons. However, the interlayer $t_\perp$ is negligible in this case. In contrast, the $d_{z^2}$ orbital demonstrates strong interlayer $t_\perp$ and $J_\perp$, while the inherent intralayer $t_\parallel$ and $J_\parallel$ are small. Based on the iPEPS results, we find clear orbital-selective behaviors in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals exhibit robust superconductive (SC) order driven by the interlayer coupling $J_\perp$; while the $d_{z^2}$ band shows relatively weak SC order as a result of small $t_\parallel$ (lack of coherence) but large $t_\perp$ (strong Pauli blocking). Furthermore, by substituting rare-earth element Pm or Sm with La, we find an enhanced SC order, which opens up a promising avenue for discovering nickelate superconductors with even higher $T_c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03909v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up a hydrodynamic description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of sine-Gordon quantum field theory for generic coupling. It is built upon an explicit form of the Bethe Ansatz description of general thermodynamic states, with the structure of the resulting coupled integral equations encoded in terms of graphical diagrams. The resulting framework is applied to derive results for the Drude weights of charge and energy. Quantities associated with the charge universally have fractal dependence on the coupling, which is notably absent from those associated with energy, a feature explained by the different roles played by reflective scattering in transporting these quantities. We then present far-from-equilibrium results, including explicit time evolution starting from bipartite initial states and dynamical correlation functions. Our framework can be applied to explore numerous other aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics, which opens the way to a wide array of theoretical studies and potential novel experimental predictions.</description>

Abstract: Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We conduct the first calculation of rank-two R\'{e}nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model and find that the area law coefficient of the R\'{e}nyi negativity has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the equilibrium Josephson current through a disordered interacting quantum dot described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model contacted by two BCS superconductors. We show that, at zero temperature and at the conformal limit, i.e. in the strong interacting limit, the Josephson current is suppressed by $U$, the strength of the interaction, as $\ln(U)/U$ and becomes universal, namely it gets independent on the superconducting pairing. At finite temperature $T$, instead, it depends on the ratio between the gap $\Delta$ and the temperature. A proximity effect exists but the self-energy corrections induced by the coupling with the superconducting leads seem subleading as compared to the self-energy due to the interaction for large number of particles. Finally we compare the results of the original four-fermion model with those obtained considering zero interaction, two-fermions and a generalized q-fermion model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bond-dependent Kitaev interaction $K$ is familiar in the effective spin model of transition metal compounds with octahedral ligands. In this work, we find a peculiar non-coplanar magnetic order can be formed with the help of $K$ and next-nearest neighbor Heisenberg coupling $J_2$ on the triangular lattice. It can be seen as a miniature version of skyrmion crystal, since it has nine spins and an integer topological number in a magnetic unit cell. The magnon excitations in such an order are studied by the linear spin-wave theory. Of note is that the change in the relative size of $J_2$ and $K$ produces topological magnon phase transitions although the topological number remains unchanged. We also calculated the experimentally observable thermal Hall conductivity, and found that the signs of thermal Hall conductivity will change with topological phase transitions or temperature changes in certain regions.</description>

Abstract: A pair of circularly polarized laser pulses of opposite helicities are shown to control the route of spin reorientation phase transition in rare-earth antiferromagnetic orthoferrite (Sm$_{0.55}$Tb$_{0.45}$)FeO$_3$. The route can be efficiently controlled by the delay between the pulses and the sample temperature. Simulations employing previously published models of \mbox{laser-induced} spin dynamics in orthoferrites failed to reproduce the experimental results. We suggest that the failure is due to neglected temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic resonance damping in the material. Taking into account the experimentally deduced temperature dependence of the damping, we obtained good agreement between the simulations and the experiment.</description>

      <title>Rapidly convergent quantum Monte Carlo using a Chebyshev projector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-reference coupled-cluster Monte Carlo (MR-CCMC) algorithm is a determinant-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm that is conceptually similar to Full Configuration Interaction QMC (FCIQMC). It has been shown to offer a balanced treatment of both static and dynamic correlation while retaining polynomial scaling, although application to large systems with significant strong correlation remained impractical. In this paper, we document recent algorithmic advances that enable rapid convergence and a more black-box approach to the multi-reference problem. These include a logarithmically scaling metric-tree based excitation acceptance algorithm to search for determinants connected to the reference space at the desired excitation level and a symmetry-screening procedure for the reference space. We show that, for moderately sized reference spaces, the new search algorithm brings about an approximately 8-fold acceleration of one MR-CCMC iteration, while the symmetry screening procedure reduces the number of active reference space determinants at essentially no loss of accuracy. We also introduce a stochastic implementation of an approximate wall projector, which is the infinite imaginary time limit of the exponential projector, using a truncated expansion of the wall function in Chebyshev polynomials. Notably, this wall-Chebyshev projector can be used to accelerate any projector-based QMC algorithm. We show that it requires significantly fewer applications of the Hamiltonian to achieve the same statistical convergence. We benchmark these acceleration methods on the beryllium and carbon dimers, using initiator FCIQMC and MR-CCMC with basis sets up to cc-pVQZ quality.</description>

      <title>Six magnetization plateau phases in a kagome antiferromagnet with $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$-type distortion</title>

Abstract: A recently discovered kagome antiferromagnet $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ has attracted significant interest due to its unique kagome lattice structure and magnetic properties. Two separate studies have proposed distinct sets of exchange interaction parameters for this compound. In this study, we investigate the ground state of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg kagome model with three types of nearest-neighbor exchange interactions under a magnetic field by exact diagonalization using the Lanczos method. We reveal that clear magnetization plateaus at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9 are present under both parameter sets, which are identified as magnon crystal states based on their spin structures. Our findings suggest that these plateaus could potentially be experimentally confirmed with magnetization measurements on $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ under a magnetic field of approximately 300 T. Due to the uncertainty in the exchange interactions of $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$, we perform additional calculations by varying these interactions. Consequently, we discover additional plateau phases at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9, each distinctly different from the magnon crystal states.</description>

      <title>Mapping twist-tuned multiband topology in bilayer WSe$_2$</title>

Abstract: Semiconductor moir\'e superlattices have been shown to host a wide array of interaction-driven ground states. However, twisted homobilayers have been difficult to study in the limit of large moir\'e wavelength, where interactions are most dominant. Here, we conduct local electronic compressibility measurements of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) at small twist angles. We demonstrate multiple topological bands which host a series of Chern insulators at zero magnetic field near a 'magic angle' around $1.23^\circ$. Using a locally applied electric field, we induce a topological quantum phase transition at one hole per moir\'e unit cell. Our work establishes the topological phase diagram of a generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in tWSe$_2$, demonstrating a tunable platform for strongly correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanics of composite fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the quantum mechanics of composite fermions based on the dipole picture initially proposed by Read. It comprises three complimentary components: a wave equation for determining the wave functions of a composite fermion in ideal fractional quantum Hall states and when subjected to external perturbations, a wave function ansatz for mapping a many-body wave function of composite fermions to a physical wave function of electrons, and a microscopic approach for determining the effective Hamiltonian of the composite fermion. The wave equation resembles the ordinary Schr\"{o}dinger equation but has drift velocity corrections which are not present in the Halperin-Lee-Read theory. The wave-function ansatz constructs a physical wave function of electrons by projecting a state of composite fermions onto a half-filled bosonic Laughlin state of vortices. Remarkably, Jain's wave function ansatz can be reinterpreted as the new ansatz in an alternative wave-function representation of composite fermions. The dipole model and the effective Hamiltonian can be derived from the microscopic model of interacting electrons confined in a Landau level, with parameters fully determined. In this framework, we can construct the physical wave function of a fractional quantum Hall state deductively by solving the wave equation and applying the wave function ansatz, based on the effective Hamiltonian derived from first principles, rather than relying on intuitions or educated guesses. For ideal fractional quantum Hall states in the lowest Landau level, the approach yields physical wave functions identical to those prescribed by the standard theory of composite fermions. We further demonstrate that the reformulated theory of composite fermions can be easily generalized for flat Chern bands.</description>

      <title>Vortical currents and reciprocal relations for transport coefficients in the electron hydrodynamic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <title>Neutral electronic excitations and derivative discontinuities: An extended $N$-centered ensemble density functional theory perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work merges two different types of many-electron ensembles, namely the Theophilou-Gross-Oliveira-Kohn ensembles of ground and neutrally-excited states, and the more recent $N$-centered ensembles of neutral and charged ground states. On that basis, an in-principle exact and general, so-called extended $N$-centered, ensemble density-functional theory of charged and neutral electronic excitations is derived. We revisit in this context the concept of density-functional derivative discontinuity for neutral excitations, without ever invoking nor using the asymptotic behavior of the ensemble electronic density. The present mathematical construction fully relies on the weight dependence of the ensemble Hartree-exchange-correlation density-functional energy, which makes the theory applicable to lattice models and opens new perspectives for the description of gaps in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Pairing in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for how the weak phonon-mediated interaction ($J_{\rm A}\!=\!1\!\sim\!4$meV) wins over the prohibitive Coulomb repulsion ($U\!=\!30\!\sim\!60$meV) and leads to a superconductor in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). We find the pairing mechanism akin to that in the A$_3$C$_{60}$ family of molecular superconductors: Each AA stacking region of MATBG resembles a C$_{60}$ molecule, in that optical phonons can dynamically lift the degeneracy of the moir\'e orbitals, in analogy to the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect. Such induced $J_{\rm A}$ has the form of an inter-valley anti-Hund's coupling and is less suppressed than $U$ by the Kondo screening near a Mott insulator. Additionally, we also considered an intra-orbital Hund's coupling $J_{\rm H}$ that originates from the on-site repulsion of a carbon atom. Under a reasonable approximation of the realistic model, we prove that the renormalized local interaction between quasi-particles must have a pairing (negative) channel in a doped correlated insulator at $\nu=\pm(2+\delta\nu)$, albeit the bare interaction is positive definite. The proof is non-perturbative and based on exact asymptotic behaviors of the vertex function imposed by Ward identities. Existence of an optimal $U$ for superconductivity is predicted. We also analyzed the pairing symmetry. In a large area of the parameter space of $J_{\rm A}$, $J_{\rm H}$, the ground state has a nematic $d$-wave singlet pairing, which, however, can lead to a $p$-wave-like nodal structure due to the Berry's phase on Fermi surfaces (or Euler obstruction).</description>

      <title>Disentangling transitions in topological order induced by boundary decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of topological orders subject to decoherence on the bipartition boundary. Focusing on the toric codes in $d$ space dimensions for $d=2,3,4$, we explore whether the boundary decoherence may be able to induce a disentangling transition, characterized by the destruction of mixed-state long-range entanglement across the bipartition, measured by topological entanglement negativity. A key insight of our approach is the connection between the negativity spectrum of the decohered mixed states and emergent symmetry-protected topological orders under certain symmetry-preserving perturbation localized on the bipartition boundary. This insight allows us to analytically derive the exact results of entanglement negativity without using a replica trick.</description>

Abstract: We use the Kantor-Susskind\cite{kantsuss} model of fermions as "dumbbells" connecting points on a cubic lattice to points on its dual, to define a duality between local fermionic models invariant under a $Z_2$ gauge symmetry and models of bosonic variables (generalizations of Pauli matrices) defined on the lattice.</description>
