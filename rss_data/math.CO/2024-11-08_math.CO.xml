      <title>Regular structures of an intractable enumeration problem: a diagonal recurrence relation of monomer-polymer coverings on two-dimensional rectangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enumeration of polymer coverings on two-dimensional rectangular lattices is considered as "intractable". We prove that the number of coverings of $s$ polymer satisfies a simple recurrence relation $ \sum_{i=0}^{2s} (-1)^i \binom{2s}{i} a_{n-i, m-i} = 2^s {(2s)!} / {s!} $ on a $n \times m$ rectangular lattice with open boundary conditions in both directions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Mutation-Acyclicity of Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in mathematical research in recent years. This paper applies ML techniques to the study of quivers--a type of directed multigraph with significant relevance in algebra, combinatorics, computer science, and mathematical physics. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of determining the mutation-acyclicity of a quiver on 4 vertices, a property that is pivotal since mutation-acyclicity is often a necessary condition for theorems involving path algebras and cluster algebras. Although this classification is known for quivers with at most 3 vertices, little is known about quivers on more than 3 vertices. We give a computer-assisted proof of a theorem to prove that mutation-acyclicity is decidable for quivers on 4 vertices with edge weight at most 2. By leveraging neural networks (NNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), we then accurately classify more general 4-vertex quivers as mutation-acyclic or non-mutation-acyclic. Our results demonstrate that ML models can efficiently detect mutation-acyclicity, providing a promising computational approach to this combinatorial problem, from which the trained SVM equation provides a starting point to guide future theoretical development.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Number Counterexample Checking and One Vertex Extension Linearly Related to $s$ and $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ramsey number $R(s,t)$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that all graphs of size $n$ contain a clique of size $s$ or an independent set of size $t$. $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n)$ is the set of all counterexample graphs without this property for a given $n$. We prove that if a graph $G_{n+1}$ of size $n+1$ has $\max\{s,t\}+1$ subgraphs in $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n)$, then $G_{n+1}$ is in $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n+1)$. Based on this, we introduce algorithms for one-vertex extension and counterexample checking with runtime linearly bound by $s$ and $t$. We prove the utility of these algorithms by verifying $\mathcal{R}(4,6,36)$ and $\mathcal{R}(5,5,43)$ are empty given current sets $\mathcal{R}(4,6,35)$ and $\mathcal{R}(5,5,42)$.</description>

      <title>Super major index and Thrall's problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thrall's problem asks for the Schur decomposition of the higher Lie modules $\mathcal{L}_\lambda$, which are defined using the free Lie algebra and decompose the tensor algebra as a general linear group module. Although special cases have been solved, Thrall's problem remains open in general. We generalize Thrall's problem to the free Lie superalgebra, and prove extensions of three known results in this setting: Brandt's formula, Klyachko's identification of the Schur--Weyl dual of $\mathcal{L}_n$, and Kr{\'a}skiewicz--Weyman's formula for the Schur decomposition of $\mathcal{L}_n$. The latter involves a new version of the major index on super tableaux, which we show corresponds to a $q,t$-hook formula of Macdonald.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Colorings Obtained by a Method of Szlam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Szlam's Lemma began life as a way of getting upper bounds on the chromatic numbers of distance graphs in normed vector spaces. Now analogs are available in a variety of hypergraph settings, but the method always involves a shrewdly chosen 2-coloring of the vertex set of a hypergraph, together with a subset of the vertex set which satisfies certain requirements with reference to the 2-coloring. From these ingredients a proper coloring of the hypergraphs is cooked up.
  In this paper, we separate the process from the conclusion of Szlam's Lemma by defining Szlam colorings of the vector spaces $\mathbb R^d$, and then a more regimented variety of these, which we call ordered Szlam colorings, which we characterize.</description>

      <title>The intersection of a random geometric graph with an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the intersection of a random geometric graph with an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph. Specifically, we generate the random geometric graph $G(n, r)$ by choosing $n$ points uniformly at random from $D=[0, 1]^2$ and joining any two points whose Euclidean distance is at most $r$. We let $G(n, p)$ be the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph, i.e. it has $n$ vertices and every pair of vertices is adjacent with probability $p$ independently. In this note we study $G(n, r, p):=G(n, r) \cap G(n, p)$. One way to think of this graph is that we take $G(n, r)$ and then randomly delete edges with probability $1-p$ independently. We consider the clique number, independence number, connectivity, Hamiltonicity, chromatic number, and diameter of this graph where both $p(n)\to 0$ and $r(n)\to 0$; the same model was studied by Kahle, Tian and Wang (2023) for $r(n)\to 0$ but $p$ fixed.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the number of rational-value sums or zero-sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the maximum number of $r$-term sums admitting rational values in $n$-element sets of irrational numbers? We determine the maximum when $r&lt;4$ or $r\geq n/2$ and also in case when we drop the condition on the number of summands. It turns out that the $r$-term sum problem is equivalent to determine the maximum number of $r$-term zero-sum subsequences in $n$-element sequences of integers, which can be seen as a variant of the famous Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is cordial if there exists a function $f$ from the vertices of $G$ to $\{0,1\}$ such that the number of vertices labelled $0$ and the number of vertices labelled $1$ differ by at most $1$, and if we assign to each edge $xy$ the label $|f(x)-f(y)|$, the number of edges labelled $0$ and the number of edges labelled $1$ also differ at most by $1$. We introduce two measures of how close a graph is to being cordial, and compute these measures for a variety of classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>On the number of partitions of the hypercube ${\bf Z}_q^n$ into large subcubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the number of partitions of the hypercube ${\bf Z}_q^n$ into $q^m$ subcubes of dimension $n-m$ each for fixed $q$, $m$ and growing $n$ is asymptotically equal to $n^{(q^m-1)/(q-1)}$.
  For the proof, we introduce the operation of the bang of a star matrix and demonstrate that any star matrix, except for a fractal, is expandable under some bang, whereas a fractal remains to be a fractal under any bang.</description>

      <title>Finite groups whose commuting graphs are line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commuting graph ${\Gamma(G)}$ of a group $G$ is the simple undirected graph with group elements as a vertex set and two elements $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $xy=yx$ in $G$. By eliminating the identity element of $G$ and all the dominant vertices of $\Gamma(G)$, the resulting subgraphs of $\Gamma(G)$ are $\Gamma^*(G)$ and $\Gamma^{**}(G)$, respectively. In this paper, we classify all the finite groups $G$ such that the graph $\Delta(G) \in \{\Gamma(G), \Gamma^*(G), \Gamma^{**}(G)\}$ is the line graph of some graph. We also classify all the finite groups $G$ whose graph $\Delta(G) \in \{\Gamma(G), \Gamma^*(G), \Gamma^{**}(G)\}$ is the complement of line graph.</description>

      <title>Characterization of graphs with orientable total domination number equal to $|V|-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a directed graph $D$, a vertex subset $S\subseteq V$ is a total dominating set if every vertex of $D$ has an in-neighbor from $S$. A total dominating set exists if and only if every vertex has at least one in-neighbor. We call the orientation of such directed graphs valid. The total domination number of $D$, denoted by $\gamma_t(D)$, is the size of the smallest total dominating set of $D$. For an undirected graph $G$, we investigate the upper (or lower) orientable total domination number of $G$, denoted by $\mathrm{DOM}_t(G)$ (or $\mathrm{dom}_t(G)$), that is the maximum (or minimum) of the total domination numbers over all valid orientations of $G$. We characterize those graphs for which $\mathrm{DOM}_t(G)=|V(G)|-1$, and consequently we show that there exists a family of graphs for which $\mathrm{DOM}_t(G)$ and $\mathrm{dom}_t(G)$ can be as far as possible, namely $\mathrm{DOM}_t(G)=|V(G)|-1$ and $\mathrm{dom}_t(G)=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An outerplanar graph is a planar graph that has a planar drawing with all vertices on the unbounded face. The matching complex of a graph is the simplicial complex whose faces are subsets of disjoint edges of the graph. In this paper we prove that the matching complexes of outerplanar graphs are contractible or homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. This extends known results about trees and polygonal line tilings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we discuss the class of Type III and Type IV codes from the perspectives of neighbors. Our investigation analogously extends the results originally presented by Dougherty [8] concerning the neighbor graph of binary self-dual codes. Moreover, as an application of neighbors in invariant theory, we show that the ring of the weight enumerators of Type II code $d_{n}^{+}$ and its neighbors in arbitrary genus is finitely generated. Finally, we obtain a minimal set of generators of this ring up to the space of degree 24 and genus 3.</description>

      <title>Some results on $\sigma_{t}$-irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\sigma_{t}$-irregularity (or sigma total index) is a graph invariant which is defined as $\sigma_{t}(G)=\sum_{\{u,v\}\subseteq V(G)}(d(u)-d(v))^{2},$ where $d(z)$ denotes the degree of $z$. This irregularity measure was proposed by R\' {e}ti [Appl. Math. Comput. 344-345 (2019) 107-115], and recently rediscovered by Dimitrov and Stevanovi\'c [Appl. Math. Comput. 441 (2023) 127709]. In this paper we remark that $\sigma_{t}(G)=n^{2}\cdot Var(G)$, where $Var(G)$ is the degree variance of the graph. Based on this observation, we characterize irregular graphs with maximum $\sigma_{t}$-irregularity. We show that among all connected graphs on $n$ vertices, the split graphs $S_{\lceil\frac{n}{4}\rceil, \lfloor\frac{3n}{4}\rfloor }$ and $S_{\lfloor\frac{n}{4}\rfloor, \lceil\frac{3n}{4}\rceil }$ have the maximum $\sigma_{t}$-irregularity, and among all complete bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices, either the complete bipartite graph $K_{\lfloor\frac{n}{4}(2-\sqrt{2})\rfloor, \lceil\frac{n}{4}(2+\sqrt{2})\rceil }$ or $K_{\lceil\frac{n}{4}(2-\sqrt{2})\rceil, \lfloor\frac{n}{4}(2+\sqrt{2})\rfloor }$ has the maximum sigma total index. Moreover, various upper and lower bounds for $\sigma_{t}$-irregularity are provided; in this direction we give a relation between the graph energy $\mathcal{E}(G)$ and sigma total index $\sigma_{t}(G)$ and give another proof of two results by Dimitrov and Stevanovi\'c. Applying Fiedler's characterization of the largest and the second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue of the graph, we also establish new relationships between $\sigma_{t}$ and $\sigma$. We conclude the paper with two conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp bounds on the virtual degrees introduced by Larsen and Shalev. This leads to improved bounds on character of symmetric groups. We then sharpen bounds of Liebeck and Shalev concerning the Witten zeta function. As an application, we characterize the fixed-point free conjugacy classes whose associated random walk mixes in 2 steps.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a cohomological approach to M\"obius inversion using derived functors in the enriched categorical setting. For a poset $P$ and a closed symmetric monoidal abelian category $\mathcal{C}$, we define M\"obius cohomology as the derived functors of an enriched hom functor on the category of $P$-modules. We prove that the Euler characteristic of our cohomology theory recovers the classical M\"obius inversion, providing a natural categorification. As a key application, we prove a categorical version of Rota's Galois Connection. Our approach unifies classical ideas from combinatorics with homological algebra.</description>

Abstract: Let $S$ be a finite set of pairwise coprime positive integers and $Ax^2+Bx$ be an integer valued polynomial with $A&gt; B\ge 0$. For integers $k\ge 1$ and $n\ge 0$, the coefficients $\gamma_{S,A,B}^k (n)$ are defined as \begin{align*} \prod_{s\in S}\frac{1}{1-q^s}\sum_{j\not\in [-k,k-1]} (-1)^{j+k}q^{Aj^2+Bj}=\sum_{n= 0}^{\infty}\gamma_{S,A,B}^k (n)q^n. \end{align*} In this paper, we investigate the positivity of $\gamma_{S,A,B}^k (n)$ for $|S|=4,5$.</description>

      <title>A characterization of graphs $G$ with $m_G(\lambda)= 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph. If every pendant path in $G$ is at least $P_s$, we denote that $G\in \mathbb{G}_s$. Furthermore, if every pendant path in $G$ is at least $P_s$ and $g(G) \geq k \geq 3$, where $g(G)$ is the girth of $G$, we say that $G\in \mathbb{G}_{s,k}$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, let $Q_s(G)$ be the set of vertices in $G$ that are distance $s$ from the pendant vertex, and let $|Q_s(G)| = q_s(G)$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, Li et al. (2024) proved that when $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $P_s$ and $G$ is neither a cycle nor a starlike tree $T_k$, it holds that $m_G(\lambda) \leq 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ and characterized the extremal graphs when $G$ is a tree. In this article, we characterize the extremal graphs for which $m_G(\lambda) = 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ when $G \in G_{{s,s+2}}$. Furthermore, we extend some of the results of Li et al. using star sets.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Error Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variant of Error Correcting Codes with no predetermined length. An Unbounded ECC with rate $R$ and distance $\varepsilon$ is an encoding of a possibly infinite message into a possibly infinite codeword, such that for every large enough $k$ we may recover the first $Rk$ symbols of the message from the first $k$ symbols of the codeword -- even when up to $\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon k$ of these codeword symbols are adversarially corrupted. We study unbounded codes over a binary alphabet in the regime of small distance $\varepsilon$, and obtain nearly-tight upper and lower bounds in several natural settings. We show that the optimal rate of such a code is between $R&lt;1-\Omega(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ and $R&gt;1-O\left(\sqrt{\varepsilon\log\log\left(1/\varepsilon\right)}\right)$. Surprisingly, our construction is non-linear, and we show that the optimal rate of a linear unbounded code is the asymptotically worse $R=1-\Theta\left(\sqrt{\varepsilon\log\left(1/\varepsilon\right)}\right)$. In the setting of random noise, the optimal rate of unbounded codes improves and matches the rate of standard codes at $R=1-\Theta({\varepsilon\log{\left(1/\varepsilon\right)}})$.</description>

      <title>The Group Cohomology of Peroidized Hypertoric Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To a graph $\Gamma$, one can associate a hypertoric variety $\mathcal{M}(\Gamma)$ and its multiplicative version $\mathcal{M}^{\mathrm{mul}}(\Gamma)$. It was shown in [DMS24] that the cohomology of $\mathcal{M}^{\mathrm{mul}}(\Gamma)$ is computed by the CKS complex, which is a finite dimensional complex attached to $\Gamma$. The multiplicative hypertoric variety can be realized as the quotient of a periodized hypertoric variety by a lattice action. In this paper, we show that the group cohomology of the lattice with coefficients in the cohomology of the prequotient is isomorphic to the cohomology of the CKS complex using a spectral sequence argument. Therefore, the group cohomology can serve as an alternative way to compute the cohomology of multiplicative hypertoric varieties.
  We also found graph-theoretic descriptions for the Euler characteristics of the graded pieces in a certain decomposition of $\mathrm{H}^\bullet(\mathcal{M}^{\mathrm{mul}}(\Gamma))$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the kissing numbers in 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 dimensions are at least 5730, 7654, 11692, 19448, and 29768, respectively. The previous records were set by Leech in 1967, and we improve on them by 384, 256, 1024, 2048, and 2048. Unlike the previous constructions, the new configurations are not cross sections of the Leech lattice minimal vectors. Instead, they are constructed by modifying the signs in the lattice vectors to open up more space for additional spheres.</description>

      <title>Unit and distinct distances in typical norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s' unit distance problem and Erd\H{o}s' distinct distances problem are among the most classical and well-known open problems in discrete mathematics. They ask for the maximum number of unit distances, or the minimum number of distinct distances, respectively, determined by $n$ points in the Euclidean plane. The question of what happens in these problems if one considers normed spaces other than the Euclidean plane has been raised in the 1980s by Ulam and Erd\H{o}s and attracted a lot of attention over the years. We give an essentially tight answer to both questions for almost all norms on $\mathbb{R}^d$, in a certain Baire categoric sense.
  For the unit distance problem we prove that for almost all norms $\|.\|$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, any set of $n$ points defines at most $\frac{1}{2} d \cdot n \log_2 n$ unit distances according to $\|.\|$. We also show that this is essentially tight, by proving that for every norm $\|.\|$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, for any large $n$, we can find $n$ points defining at least $\frac{1}{2}(d-1-o(1))\cdot n \log_2 n$ unit distances according to $\|.\|$.
  For the distinct distances problem, we prove that for almost all norms $\|.\|$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ any set of $n$ points defines at least $(1-o(1))n$ distinct distances according to $\|.\|$. This is clearly tight up to the $o(1)$ term.
  We also answer the famous Hadwiger--Nelson problem for almost all norms on $\mathbb{R}^2$, showing that their unit distance graph has chromatic number $4$.
  Our results settle, in a strong and somewhat surprising form, problems and conjectures of Brass, Matou\v{s}ek, Brass-Moser-Pach, Chilakamarri, and Robertson. The proofs combine combinatorial and geometric ideas with tools from Linear Algebra, Topology and Algebraic Geometry.</description>

Abstract: Denote by Q_d the d-dimensional hypercube. Addressing a recent question we estimate the number of ways the vertex set of Q_d can be partitioned into vertex disjoint smaller cubes. Among other results, we prove that the asymptotic order of this function is not much larger than the number of perfect matchings of Q_d. We also describe several new (and old) questions.</description>

      <title>Circulant graphs with valency up to 4 that admit perfect state transfer in Grover walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We completely characterize circulant graphs with valency up to $4$ that admit perfect state transfer. Those of valency $3$ do not admit it. On the other hand, circulant graphs with valency $4$ admit perfect state transfer only in two infinite families: one discovered by Zhan and another new family, while no others do. The main tools for deriving these results are symmetry of graphs and eigenvalues. We describe necessary conditions for perfect state transfer to occur based on symmetry of graphs, which mathematically refers to automorphisms of graphs. As for eigenvalues, if perfect state transfer occurs, then certain eigenvalues of the corresponding isotropic random walks must be the halves of algebraic integers. Taking this into account, we utilize known results on the rings of integers of cyclotomic fields.</description>

Abstract: For a graph $G$ and an integer $k\geq 2$, a $\chi'_{k}$-coloring of $G$ is an edge coloring of $G$ such that the subgraph induced by the edges of each color has all degrees congruent to $1 ~ (\mod k)$, and $\chi'_{k}(G)$ is the minimum number of colors in a $\chi'_{k}$-coloring of $G$. In ["The mod $k$ chromatic index of graphs is $O(k)$", J. Graph Theory. 2023; 102: 197-200], Botler, Colucci and Kohayakawa proved that $\chi'_{k}(G)\leq 198k-101$ for every graph $G$. In this paper, we show that $\chi'_{k}(G) \leq 177k-93$.</description>

Abstract: We present a bijection between two well-known objects in the ubiquitous Catalan family: non-decreasing parking functions and {\L}ukasiewicz paths. This bijection maps the maximal displacement of a parking function to the height of the corresponding {\L}ukasiewicz path, and the total displacement to the area of the path. We also study this bijection restricted to two specific families of parking-functions: unit-interval parking functions, and prime parking functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that all totally positive formal power series with integer coefficients and constant term $1$ are precisely the rank-generating functions of Schur-positive upho posets, thereby resolving the main conjecture proposed by Gao, Guo, Seetharaman, and Seidel. To achieve this, we construct a bijection between finitary colored upho posets and atomic, left-cancellative, invertible-free monoids, which restricts to a correspondence between $\mathbb{N}$-graded colored upho posets and left-cancellative homogeneous monoids. Furthermore, we introduce semi-upho posets and develop a convolution operation on colored upho posets with colored semi-upho posets within this monoid-theoretic framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.00379v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotic behavior of the moments $M_k(\lambda)$ of the sum $X_1+\dots+X_{N_\lambda}$, where $N_\lambda$ follows the Poisson probability distribution with mean value $\lambda$ and $\{X_j\}$ is a family of i.i.d. random variables also independent from $N_\lambda$. We obtain an explicit expression for the leading term of $M_k(\lambda)$ as $k\to\infty$ and study it in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of $\lambda= \lambda_k$.
  In application, we establish a concentration property of maximal vertex degree of large weighted random graphs. Another application is related with a variable that arises in the studies of high moments of large random matrices. Finally, regarding three particular cases of probability distribution of $X_j$, we comment on the asymptotic behavior of certain combinatorial polynomials, including the Bell polynomials of even partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.10067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We settle a version of the conjecture about intransitive dice posed by Conrey, Gabbard, Grant, Liu and Morrison in 2016 and Polymath in 2017. We consider generalized dice with $n$ faces and we say that a die $A$ beats $B$ if a random face of $A$ is more likely to show a higher number than a random face of $B$. We study random dice with faces drawn iid from the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$ and conditioned on the sum of the faces equal to $n/2$. Considering the "beats" relation for three such random dice, Polymath showed that each of eight possible tournaments between them is asymptotically equally likely. In particular, three dice form an intransitive cycle with probability converging to $1/4$. In this paper we prove that for four random dice not all tournaments are equally likely and the probability of a transitive tournament is strictly higher than $3/8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a graduate-level introduction to graph theory, corresponding to a quarter-long course. It covers simple graphs, multigraphs as well as their directed analogues, and more restrictive classes such as tournaments, trees and arborescences. Among the features discussed are Eulerian circuits, Hamiltonian cycles, spanning trees, the matrix-tree and BEST theorems, proper colorings, Turan's theorem, bipartite matching and the Menger and Gallai--Milgram theorems. The basics of network flows are introduced in order to prove Hall's marriage theorem.
  Around a hundred exercises are included (without solutions).</description>

Abstract: Standard techniques for treating linear recurrences no longer apply for quadratic recurrences. It is not hard to determine asymptotics for a specific parametrized model over a wide domain of values (all $p \neq 1/2$ here).

      <title>Simplifying and Characterizing DAGs and Phylogenetic Networks via Least Common Ancestor Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00708</link>

Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks, or more generally, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are widely used to model species or gene relationships that traditional rooted trees cannot fully capture, especially in the presence of reticulate processes or horizontal gene transfers. Such networks or DAGs are typically inferred from genomic data of extant taxa, providing only an estimate of the true evolutionary history. However, these inferred DAGs are often complex and difficult to interpret. In particular, many contain vertices that do not serve as least common ancestors (LCAs) for any subset of the underlying genes or species, thus lacking direct support from the observed data. In contrast, LCA vertices represent ancestral states substantiated by the data, offering important insights into evolutionary relationships among subsets of taxa. To reduce unnecessary complexity and eliminate unsupported vertices, we aim to simplify a DAG to retain only LCA vertices while preserving essential evolutionary information.
  In this paper, we characterize $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant and $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant DAGs, defined as those in which every vertex serves as an LCA (or unique LCA) for some subset of taxa. We introduce methods to identify LCAs in DAGs and efficiently transform any DAG into an $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant or $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant one while preserving key structural properties of the original DAG or network. This transformation is achieved using a simple operator ``$\ominus$'' that mimics vertex suppression.</description>

      <title>The fundamental group and the magnitude-path spectral sequence of a directed graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental group of a directed graph admits a natural sequence of quotient groups called $r$-fundamental groups, and the $r$-fundamental groups can capture properties of a directed graph that the fundamental group cannot capture. The fundamental group of a directed graph is related to path homology through the Hurewicz theorem. The magnitude-path spectral sequence connects magnitude homology and path homology of a directed graph, and it may be thought of as a sequence of homology of a directed graph, including path homology. In this paper, we study relations of the $r$-fundamental groups and the magnitude-path spectral sequence through the Hurewicz theorem and the Seifert-van Kampen theorem.</description>
