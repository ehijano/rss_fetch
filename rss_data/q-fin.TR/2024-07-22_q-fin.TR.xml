      <title>Offline Digital Euro: a Minimum Viable CBDC using Groth-Sahai proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current digital payment solutions are fragile and offer less privacy than traditional cash.
  Their critical dependency on an online service used to perform and validate transactions makes them void if this service is unreachable.
  Moreover, no transaction can be executed during server malfunctions or power outages.
  Due to climate change, the likelihood of extreme weather increases. As extreme weather is a major cause of power outages, the frequency of power outages is expected to increase.
  The lack of privacy is an inherent result of their account-based design or the use of a public ledger.
  The critical dependency and lack of privacy can be resolved with a Central Bank Digital Currency that can be used offline.
  This thesis proposes a design and a first implementation for an offline-first digital euro.
  The protocol offers complete privacy during transactions using zero-knowledge proofs.
  Furthermore, transactions can be executed offline without third parties and retroactive double-spending detection is facilitated.
  To protect the users' privacy, but also guard against money laundering, we have added the following privacy-guarding mechanism.
  The bank and trusted third parties for law enforcement must collaborate to decrypt transactions, revealing the digital pseudonym used in the transaction.
  Importantly, the transaction can be decrypted without decrypting prior transactions attached to the digital euro.
  The protocol has a working initial implementation showcasing its usability and demonstrating functionality.</description>

      <title>Construction and Hedging of Equity Index Options Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of systematic index option-writing strategies, focusing on S&amp;P500 index options. We compare the performance of hedging strategies using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model and the Variance-Gamma (VG) model, emphasizing varying moneyness levels and different sizing methods based on delta and the VIX Index. The study employs 1-minute data of S&amp;P500 index options and index quotes spanning from 2018 to 2023. The analysis benchmarks hedged strategies against buy-and-hold and naked option-writing strategies, with a focus on risk-adjusted performance metrics including transaction costs. Portfolio delta approximations are derived using implied volatility for the BSM model and market-calibrated parameters for the VG model. Key findings reveal that systematic option-writing strategies can potentially yield superior returns compared to buy-and-hold benchmarks. The BSM model generally provided better hedging outcomes than the VG model, although the VG model showed profitability in certain naked strategies as a tool for position sizing. In terms of rehedging frequency, we found that intraday hedging in 130-minute intervals provided both reliable protection against adverse market movements and a satisfactory returns profile.</description>
