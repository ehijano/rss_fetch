      <title>Diagnosing local minima and accelerating convergence of variational quantum eigensolvers with quantum subspace techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that wavefunction evolution in real- and imaginary-time can generate quantum subspaces with significant utility for obtaining accurate ground state energies. Inspired by these methods, we propose combining quantum subspace techniques with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). In our approach, the parameterized quantum circuit is divided into a series of smaller subcircuits. The sequential application of these subcircuits to an initial state generates a set of wavefunctions that we use as a quantum subspace to obtain high-accuracy groundstate energies. We call this technique the circuit subspace variational quantum eigensolver (CSVQE) algorithm. By benchmarking CSVQE on a range of quantum chemistry problems, we show that it can achieve significant error reduction compared to conventional VQE, particularly for poorly optimized circuits, greatly improving convergence rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when applied to circuits trapped at a local minima, CSVQE can produce energies close to the global minimum of the energy landscape, making it a potentially powerful tool for diagnosing local minima.</description>

      <title>Learning to rank quantum circuits for hardware-optimized performance enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and experimentally test a machine-learning-based method for ranking logically equivalent quantum circuits based on expected performance estimates derived from a training procedure conducted on real hardware. We apply our method to the problem of layout selection, in which abstracted qubits are assigned to physical qubits on a given device. Circuit measurements performed on IBM hardware indicate that the maximum and median fidelities of logically equivalent layouts can differ by an order of magnitude. We introduce a circuit score used for ranking that is parameterized in terms of a physics-based, phenomenological error model whose parameters are fit by training a ranking-loss function over a measured dataset. The dataset consists of quantum circuits exhibiting a diversity of structures and executed on IBM hardware, allowing the model to incorporate the contextual nature of real device noise and errors without the need to perform an exponentially costly tomographic protocol. We perform model training and execution on the 16-qubit ibmq_guadalupe device and compare our method to two common approaches: random layout selection and a publicly available baseline called Mapomatic. Our model consistently outperforms both approaches, predicting layouts that exhibit lower noise and higher performance. In particular, we find that our best model leads to a $1.8\times$ reduction in selection error when compared to the baseline approach and a $3.2\times$ reduction when compared to random selection. Beyond delivering a new form of predictive quantum characterization, verification, and validation, our results reveal the specific way in which context-dependent and coherent gate errors appear to dominate the divergence from performance estimates extrapolated from simple proxy measures.</description>

      <title>Scalable noise characterisation of syndrome extraction circuits with averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising the performance of noisy quantum circuits is central to the production of prototype quantum computers and can enable improved quantum error correction that exploits noise biases identified in a quantum device. We describe an implementation of averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES), a general framework for the scalable noise characterisation of quantum circuits. ACES is capable of simultaneously estimating the Pauli error probabilities of all gates in a Clifford circuit, and captures averaged spatial correlations between gates implemented simultaneously in the circuit. By rigorously analysing the performance of ACES experiments, we derive a figure of merit for their expected performance, allowing us to optimise ACES experimental designs and improve the precision to which we estimate noise given fixed experimental resources. Since the syndrome extraction circuits of quantum error correcting codes are representative components of a fault-tolerant architecture, we demonstrate the scalability and performance of our ACES protocol through circuit-level numerical simulations of the entire noise characterisation procedure for the syndrome extraction circuit of a distance 25 surface code with over 1000 qubits. Our results indicate that detailed noise characterisation methods are scalable to near-term quantum devices. We release our code in the form of the Julia package AveragedCircuitEigenvalueSampling.jl.</description>

      <title>Fast Super Robust Nonadiabatic Geometric Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation (NGQC) provides a means to perform fast and robust quantum gates. To enhance the robustness of NGQC against control errors, numerous solutions have been proposed by predecessors. However, these solutions typically result in extended operation times for quantum gates. In order to maintain the robustness of quantum gates to control errors while shortening operation times to minimize the effects of decoherence, we introduce Fast Super Robust NGQC(FSR-NGQC). This approach achieves faster speeds when operating small-angle rotation gates. Through numerical calculations, we have demonstrated the performance of our scheme in a decoherence environment. The results show that our scheme achieves higher fidelity, thus enabling fast and robust geometric quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A flexible quantum data bus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multi-path routing of entanglement in quantum networks, where a pre-prepared multipartite entangled 2D cluster state serves as a resource to perform different tasks on demand. We show how to achieve parallel connections between multiple, freely chosen groups of parties by performing appropriate local measurements among diagonal paths, which preserves the entanglement structure of the remaining state. We demonstrate how to route multiple Bell-states along parallel lines via crossings, turns and fade-in/-outs, analogously to a data bus. The results apply to networks at any scale.</description>

      <title>Replication-based quantum annealing error mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealers like those from D-Wave Systems implement adiabatic quantum computing to solve optimization problems, but their analog nature and limited control functionalities present challenges to correcting or mitigating errors. As quantum computing advances towards applications, effective error suppression is an important research goal. We propose a new approach called replication based mitigation (RBM) based on parallel quantum annealing. In RBM, physical qubits representing the same logical qubit are dispersed across different copies of the problem embedded in the hardware. This mitigates hardware biases, is compatible with limited qubit connectivity in current annealers, and is suited for available noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) annealers. Our experimental analysis shows that RBM provides solution quality on par with previous methods while being compatible with a much wider range of hardware connectivity patterns. In comparisons against standard quantum annealing without error mitigation, RBM consistently improves the energies and ground state probabilities across parameterized problem sets.</description>

      <title>Superoperator master equations for depolarizing dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work is devoted to superoperator master equations. Namely, the superoperator master equations in the case of the twirling hyperprojector with respect to the whole unitary group are derived. To be consistent with such a hyperprojector the free dynamics is assumed to be depolarizing. And it is perturbed by the arbitrary Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad generator. The explicit form of the second order master equations are presented in this case.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Cooling Quantum Systems with Finite Resources: Insights from Thermodynamic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landauer's universal limit on heat dissipation during information erasure becomes increasingly crucial as computing devices shrink: minimising heat-induced errors demands optimal pure-state preparation. For this, however, Nernst's third law posits an infinite-resource requirement: either energy, time, or control complexity must diverge. Here, we address the practical challenge of efficiently cooling quantum systems using finite resources. We investigate the ensuing resource trade-offs and present efficient protocols for finite distinct energy gaps in settings pertaining to coherent or incoherent control, corresponding to quantum batteries and heat engines, respectively. Expressing energy bounds through thermodynamic length, our findings illuminate the optimal distribution of energy gaps, detailing the resource limitations of preparing pure states in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic modulation of driving protocols in periodically driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a periodically driven system where the high-frequency driving protocol consists of a sequence of potentials switched on and off at different instants within a period. We explore the possibility of introducing an adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol by considering a slow evolution of the instants when the sequence of potentials is switched on/off. We examine how this influences the long-term dynamics of periodically driven quantum systems. By assuming that the slow and fast timescales in the problem can be decoupled, we derive the stroboscopic (effective) Hamiltonian for a four-step driving sequence up to the first order in perturbation theory. We then apply this approach to a rigid rotor, where the adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol is chosen to produce an evolving emergent magnetic field that interacts with the rotor's spin. We study the emergence of $\textit{diabolical points}$ and $\textit{diabolical loci}$ in the parameter space of the effective Hamiltonian. Further, we study the topological properties of the maps of the adiabatic paths in the parameter space to the eigenspace of the effective Hamiltonian. In effect, we obtain a technique to tune the topological properties of the eigenstates by selecting various adiabatic evolution of the driving protocol characterized by different paths in the parameter space. This technique can be applied to any periodic driving protocol to achieve desirable topological effects.</description>

      <title>Vibrational ADAPT-VQE: Critical points leads to problematic convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is one of the most promising applications for which quantum computing is expected to have significant impact. Despite considerable research in the field of electronic structure, calculating the vibrational properties of molecules on quantum computers remain a relatively unexplored field. In this work, we develop a vibrational ADAPT-VQE (vADAPT-VQE) formalism based on an infinite product representation (IPR) of anti-Hermitian excitation operators of the Full Vibrational Configuration Interaction (FVCI) wavefunction which allows for preparing eigenstates of vibrational Hamiltonians on quantum computers. In order to establish the vADAPT- VQE algorithm using the IPR, we study the exactness of disentangled Unitary Vibrational Coupled Cluster (dUVCC) theory and show that dUVCC can formally represent the FVCI wavefunction in an infinite expansion. To investigate the performance of the vADAPT-VQE algorithm, we numerically study whether the vADAPT-VQE algorithm generates a sequence of operators which may represent the FVCI wavefunction. Our numerical results indicate frequent appearance of critical points in the wavefunction preparation using vADAPT-VQE. These results imply that one may encounter diminishing usefulness when preparing vibrational wavefunctions on quantum computers using vADAPT-VQE and that additional studies are required to find methods that can circumvent this behavior.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic channel simulation using coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel simulation using coherence, which refers to realizing a target channel with coherent states and free operations, is a fundamental problem in quantum resource theory. The limitations of the accuracy of deterministic channel simulation motivate us to consider the more general probabilistic framework. In this work, we show the relation between the maximal success probability and the accuracy of channel simulation with free operations. When the chosen free operation is the maximally incoherent operation (MIO), we provide an efficiently computable semidefinite program (SDP) to calculate the maximal success probability and derive the analytic expression of success probability for some special cases. When the chosen free operation is dephasing-covariant incoherent operations (DIO), it is proved that if the target channel is not a resource nonactivating channel, then one cannot simulate it exactly both deterministically and probabilistically. The SDP for maximal success probability of simulating channel by DIO is also given correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Statistical evaluation of 571 GaAs quantum point contact transistors showing the 0.7 anomaly in quantized conductance using millikelvin cryogenic on-chip multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass production and the practical number of cryogenic quantum devices producible in a single chip are limited to the number of electrical contact pads and wiring of the cryostat or dilution refrigerator. It is, therefore, beneficial to contrast the measurements of hundreds of devices fabricated in a single chip in one cooldown process to promote the scalability, integrability, reliability, and reproducibility of quantum devices and to save evaluation time, cost and energy. Here, we use a cryogenic on-chip multiplexer architecture and investigate the statistics of the 0.7 anomaly observed on the first three plateaus of the quantized conductance of semiconductor quantum point contact (QPC) transistors. Our single chips contain 256 split gate field effect QPC transistors (QFET) each, with two 16-branch multiplexed source-drain and gate pads, allowing individual transistors to be selected, addressed and controlled through an electrostatic gate voltage process. A total of 1280 quantum transistors with nano-scale dimensions are patterned in 5 different chips of GaAs heterostructures. From the measurements of 571 functioning QPCs taken at temperatures T= 1.4 K and T= 40 mK, it is found that the spontaneous polarisation model and Kondo effect do not fit our results. Furthermore, some of the features in our data largely agreed with van Hove model with short-range interactions. Our approach provides further insight into the quantum mechanical properties and microscopic origin of the 0.7 anomaly in QPCs, paving the way for the development of semiconducting quantum circuits and integrated cryogenic electronics, for scalable quantum logic control, readout, synthesis, and processing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a precise certification test of the dimension of a qubit system on the public IBM quantum computer, using the determinant dimension witness and with a minimal number of independent parameters. We achieve it by mapping the Bloch sphere $\pi/2$-rotation axis angle on the nonplanar so-called Viviani curve. During the implementation of the rotation by single qubit gates on IBM devices, we found the majority of qubits passing the test, although some specific qubits failed by more than ten standard deviations. The nature of those deviations has no simple explanation, as the test is robust against common non-idealities.</description>

      <title>A scalable 2-local architecture for quantum annealing of all-to-all Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving dense connectivities is a challenge for most quantum computing platforms today, and a particularly crucial one for the case of quantum annealing applications. In this context, we present a scalable architecture for quantum annealers defined on a graph of degree $d=3$ and containing exclusively 2-local interactions to realize an all-to-all connected Ising model. This amounts to an efficient braiding of logical chains of qubits which can be derived from a description of the problem in terms of triangles. We also devise strategies to address the challenges of scalable architectures, such as the faster shrinking of the gap due to the larger physical Hilbert space, based on driver Hamiltonians more suited to the symmetries of the logical solution space. We thus show an alternative route to scale up devices dedicated to classical optimization tasks within the quantum annealing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Edge Detection Quantumized: A Novel Quantum Algorithm For Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum image processing is a research field that explores the use of quantum computing and algorithms for image processing tasks such as image encoding and edge detection. Although classical edge detection algorithms perform reasonably well and are quite efficient, they become outright slower when it comes to large datasets with high-resolution images. Quantum computing promises to deliver a significant performance boost and breakthroughs in various sectors. Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection (QHED) algorithm, for example, works at constant time complexity, and thus detects edges much faster than any classical algorithm. However, the original QHED algorithm is designed for Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE) and mainly works for binary images. This paper presents a novel protocol by combining the Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) encoding and a modified QHED algorithm. An improved edge outline method has been proposed in this work resulting in a better object outline output and more accurate edge detection than the traditional QHED algorithm.</description>

      <title>Discrete time crystals in the presence of non-Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete time crystals (DTCs) in periodically driven quantum systems, in the presence of non-Markovian dissipation. In contrast to DTCs observed in earlier works in the presence of Markovian dynamics, using the open Dicke model in presence of Jaynes-Cummings-like dissipation, we show that non-Markovian regime can be highly beneficial for stabilizing DTCs over a wide range of parameter values. This may be attributed to periodically varying dissipation rates even at long times in the case of non-Markovian dynamics. Further the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes show sharp distinctions for intermediate strengths of the dissipator coefficient, with a time-independent steady-state in the Markovian regime being replaced by varied dynamical phases, including DTC order, in the non-Markovian regime. We also verify the robustness of the DTC phase in the non-Markovian regime by introducing errors both in the Hamiltonian as well as in the dissipation. Our study shows the possibility of using DTC as a probe for non-Markovian dynamics in periodically modulated open quantum systems, at long times.</description>

      <title>Restoring the topological edge states in a finite optical superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of edge states in a finite optical lattice and show that the boundaries of the lattice play a decisive role for their location in the corresponding energy spectrum. We introduce a simple parametrisation of the boundaries of the optical lattice and demonstrate the existence of an optimal choice of the values of the parameters which lead to an approximate restoration of chiral symmetry. A crucial property of this optimization is the suppression of tunneling between next-nearest neighboring wells of the lattice. This in turn allows the mapping of the optical lattice set-up to a finite SSH model. The topological character of the emerging edge states is discussed.</description>

      <title>Phenomenon of a stronger trapping behaviour in $\Lambda$-type quantum systems with symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\Lambda$, $V$, $\Xi$ (ladder), and other three-level quantum systems with one forbidden transition ($\Lambda$-type systems) play an important role in quantum physics. Various applications require manipulation by such systems using as control shaped laser field. In this work, we study how degeneracy in energy states and Bohr frequencies of these systems affects the efficiency or difficulty of finding optimal shape of the control field. For this, we adopt the notion of higher order traps which was introduced in [A.N. Pechen and D.J. Tannor, Are there traps in quantum control landscapes? Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 106}, 120402 (2011)], where second/third order traps were discovered for $\Lambda$-type systems with one forbidden transition and with non-degenerate energy levels. We study control of such systems with and without denegeracy in their eigenstates and Bohr frequencies, and investigate how these degeneracies influence on the efficiency of optimizing the control laser field. We find that the degeneracy of Bohr frequencies in the $\Xi$ system leads to the appearance of seventh order trap with a more significant attracting domain resulting in a more difficult optimization, while degeneracy in energy states of $\Lambda$-type systems does not lead to increase of the order of the zero control trap compared to the non-degenerate case.</description>

      <title>Quantum Network Tomography via Learning Isometries on Stiefel Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit mathematical reconstructions of quantum networks play a significant role in developing quantum information science. However, tremendous parameter requirements and physical constraint implementations have become computationally non-ignorable encumbrances. In this work, we propose an efficient method for quantum network tomography by learning isometries on the Stiefel manifold. Tasks of reconstructing quantum networks are tackled by solving a series of unconstrained optimization problems with significantly less parameters. The step-wise isometry estimation shows the capability for providing information of the truncated quantum comb while processing the tomography. Remarkably, this method enables the compressive QCT by specifying the dimensions of isometries. As a result, our proposed method exhibits high accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Crank-Nicolson and Method of Lines for the Solution of Initial Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use a Variational Quantum Algorithm to solve Initial Value Problems with the Implicit Crank-Nicolson and the Method of Lines evolution schemes. The unknown functions use a spectral decomposition with the Fourier basis. The examples developed to illustrate the implementation are the advection equation, the wave equation written as a first order system of coupled equations and the viscous Burgers equation as a non-linear case. The problems are solved using: i) standard Finite Differences as the solution to compare with, ii) the State Vector Formalism (SVF), and iii) the Sampling Error Formalism (SEF). Our results for these equations show that the SVF provides convergent solutions whereas those constructed with the SEF are not consistent with the increase of resolution. Byproducts of our implementation include the construction of cost functions for the two evolution schemes and an efficient method to simulate the SVF and SEF in classical computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunneling: From Theory to Error-Mitigated Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since the discussions about a possible quantum computer arised, quantum simulations have been at the forefront of possible utilities and the task of quantum simulations is one that promises quantum advantage. In recent years, simulations of large molecules through VQE or dynamics of many-body spin Hamiltonians may be possible, and even able to achieve useful results with the use of error mitigation techniques. Simulating smaller models is also important, and currently, in the NISQ (Noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era, it is easier and less prone to errors. This current study encompasses the theoretical background and the hardware aware circuit implementation of a quantum tunneling simulation. Specifically, this study presents the theoretical background needed for such implementation and highlights the main steps of development. Building on classic approaches of quantum tunneling simulations, this study improves the result of such simulations by employing error mitigation techniques (ZNE and REM) and uses them in conjunction with multiprogramming of the quantum chip for solving the hardware under-utilization problem that arises in such contexts. Moreover, we highlight the need for hardware-aware circuit implementations and discuss these considerations in detail to give an end-to-end workflow overview of quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the medium term, quantum computing must tackle two key challenges: fault tolerance and security. Fault tolerance will be solved with sufficiently high quality experiments on large numbers of qubits, but the scale and complexity of these devices means that a cloud-based access model is likely to dominate. How can we risk evaluating valuable computations on an untrusted server? Here we detail a verifiable circuit-based model that only requires classical communication between parties. The server is blind to the details of the computation, which is computationally secure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quantum mechanics in non-inertial reference frames, particularly in the context of open systems, introduces several intriguing phenomena and challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing the quantum mechanics of open systems undergoing noninertial motion. Our methodology leverages the concept of dissipatons, statistical quasi-particles that capture collective dissipative effects from the environment. We demonstrate that our approach offers a natural understanding of the intricate dynamics among non-inertial effects, decoherence, dissipation, and system-bath entanglement. Specifically, we conduct demonstrations focusing on the Lamb shift phenomenon within a rotating ring cavity. Through theoretical exposition and practical applications, our framework elucidates the profound interplay between open quantum dynamics and non-inertial motion, paving the way for advancements in quantum information processing and sensing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common wisdom says that the entanglement of fermionic systems can be low in the second quantization formalism but is extremely large in the first quantization. Hence Matrix Product State (MPS) methods based on moderate entanglement have been overwhelmingly formulated in second quantization. Here we introduce a first-quantized MPS approach to simulate quantum many-body systems. We show that by reformulating the way the fermionic anti-symmetry is handled, we arrive at MPS with a level of entanglement comparable to the usual one found in second quantization. We demonstrate our scheme on the one-dimensional $t$-$V$ model (spinless fermions with nearest neighbour density-density interaction) for both ground state and time evolution. For time evolution, we find that the entanglement entropy in first quantization is significantly smaller than in its second quantization counterpart.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) source of entangled photons enables higher efficiency in entanglement distribution than SPDC sources and can be carried out using both space-to-ground and ground-to-ground links. We demonstrate the flexibility of ZALM architectures to be adapted to alternative entanglement distribution protocols. Focusing on the counter-intuitive result that entanglement can be generated between distant parties without using any entanglement as a resource, we analyze two protocols for entanglement distribution to memories via separable states. Modelling them in a ZALM setup, we consider the effects of noise both in the communication channels and in the memories. We thereby identify the optimal protocol to use, with respect to the highest entanglement generated, given the noise conditions of the network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose efficient algorithms for classically simulating Gaussian unitaries and measurements applied to non-Gaussian initial states. The constructions are based on decomposing the non-Gaussian states into linear combinations of Gaussian states. We use an extension of the covariance matrix formalism to efficiently track relative phases in the superpositions of Gaussian states. We get an exact simulation that scales quadratically with the number of Gaussian states required to represent the initial state and an approximate simulation algorithm that scales linearly with the degree. We define measures of non-Gaussianty quantifying this simulation cost, which we call the Gaussian rank and the Gaussian extent. From the perspective of quantum resource theories, we investigate the properties of this type of non-Gaussianity measure and compute optimal decomposition for states relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing.</description>

      <title>On noise in swap ASAP repeater chains: exact analytics, distributions and tight approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Losses are one of the main bottlenecks for the distribution of entanglement in quantum networks, which can be overcome by the implementation of quantum repeaters. The most basic form of a quantum repeater chain is the swap ASAP repeater chain. In such a repeater chain, elementary links are probabilistically generated and deterministically swapped as soon as two adjacent links have been generated. As each entangled state is waiting to be swapped, decoherence is experienced, turning the fidelity of the entangled state between the end nodes of the chain into a random variable. Fully characterizing the (average) fidelity as the repeater chain grows is still an open problem. Here, we analytically investigate the case of equally-spaced repeaters, where we find exact analytic formulae for all moments of the fidelity up to 25 segments. We obtain these formulae by providing a general solution in terms of a generating function; a function whose n'th term in its Maclaurin series yields the moments of the fidelity for n segments. We generalize this approaches as well to a global cut-off policy -- a method for increasing fidelity at the cost of longer entanglement delivery times -- allowing for fast optimization of the cut-off parameter by eliminating the need for Monte Carlo simulation. We furthermore find simple approximations of the average fidelity that are exponentially tight, and, for up to 10 segments, the full distribution of the delivered fidelity. We use this to analytically calculate the secret-key rate when the distributed entanglement is used for quantum-key distribution, both with and without binning methods. In follow-up work we exploit a connection to a model in statistical physics to numerically calculate quantities of interest for the inhomogeneous multipartite case.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic-Depth Quantum Circuits for Hamming Weight Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pure state of fixed Hamming weight is a superposition of computational basis states such that each bitstring in the superposition has the same number of ones. Given a Hilbert space of the form $\mathcal{H} = (\mathbb{C}_2)^{\otimes n}$, or an $n$-qubit system, the identity operator can be decomposed as a sum of projectors onto subspaces of fixed Hamming weight. In this work, we propose several quantum algorithms that realize a coherent Hamming weight projective measurement on an input pure state, meaning that the post-measurement state of the algorithm is the projection of the input state onto the corresponding subspace of fixed Hamming weight. We analyze a depth-width trade-off for the corresponding quantum circuits, allowing for a depth reduction of the circuits at the cost of more control qubits. For an $n$-qubit input, the depth-optimal algorithm uses $O(n)$ control qubits and the corresponding circuit has depth $O(\log (n))$, assuming that we have the ability to perform qubit resets. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm construction uses only one- and two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Quantum Optimization: A Use Case Study on NISQ Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The major advances in quantum computing over the last few decades have sparked great interest in applying it to solve the most challenging computational problems in a wide variety of areas. One of the most pronounced domains here are optimization problems and a number of algorithmic approaches have been proposed for their solution. For the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and quantum annealing (QA) are the central algorithms for this problem class. The two former can be executed on digital gate-model quantum computers, whereas the latter requires a quantum annealer. Across all hardware architectures and manufactures, the quantum computers available today share the property of being too error-prone to reliably execute involved quantum circuits as they typically arise from quantum optimization algorithms. In order to characterize the limits of existing quantum computers, many component and system level benchmarks have been proposed. However, owing to the complex nature of the errors in quantum systems these benchmark fail to provide predictive power beyond simple quantum circuits and small examples. Application oriented benchmarks have been proposed to remedy this problem, but both, results from real quantum systems as well as use cases beyond constructed academic examples, remain very rare. This paper addresses precisely this gap by considering two industrial relevant use cases: one in the realm of optimizing charging schedules for electric vehicles, the other concerned with the optimization of truck routes. Our central contribution are systematic series of examples derived from these uses cases that we execute on different processors of the gate-based quantum computers of IBM as well as on the quantum annealer of D-Wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum data embedding protocol based on the preparation of a ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. We analyze the corresponding quantum feature map, recasting it as an adiabatic state preparation procedure with Trotterized evolution. We compare the properties of underlying quantum models with ubiquitous Fourier-type quantum models, and show that ground state embeddings can be described effectively by a spectrum with degree that grows rapidly with the number of qubits, corresponding to a large model capacity. We observe that the spectrum contains massive frequency degeneracies, and the weighting coefficients for the modes are highly structured, thus limiting model expressivity. Our results provide a step towards understanding models based on quantum data, and contribute to fundamental knowledge needed for building efficient quantum machine learning (QML) protocols. As non-trivial embeddings are crucial for designing QML protocols that cannot be simulated classically, our findings guide the search for high-capacity quantum models that can largely outperform classical models.</description>

      <title>An indeterminacy-based ontology for quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present and defend a new ontology for quantum theories (or "interpretations" of quantum theory) called Generative Quantum Theory (GQT). The ontology assumes that the world can be fundamentally indeterminate in the sense of being constituted by entities with indeterminate properties. The process via which determinate values arise and persist differs in different quantum theories. I will focus on the following quantum theories: GRW, the Many-Worlds Interpretation and single-world relationalist theories, Bohmian Mechanics, hybrid classical-quantum theories, and Environmental Determinacy-based (EnD) Quantum Theory. Moreover, quantum states represent quantum properties and structures that give rise to determinacy, and each quantum theory specifies a structure with specific features. I will argue that GQT should be taken seriously because it provides a series of benefits that current influential ontologies lack, namely, wavefunction realism and primitive ontology, without some of their costs. Furthermore, it allows for the formulation of quantum theories that are clearly compatible with relativistic causality, such as EnD Quantum Theory. Finally, I will show how GQT provides a new way to compare and evaluate different quantum theories.</description>

      <title>Exact Floquet flat band and heating suppression via two-rate drive protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of exact Floquet flat bands implying strong violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in a large class of closed quantum many-body systems in the presence of a two-rate drive characterized by frequencies $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2=\nu \Omega_1$. We provide the exact analytic condition for this phenomenon to occur for a generic protocol; in particular, $\nu=(2p+1)$, where $p$ is an integer, leads to such flat bands for both square-pulse and cosine drive protocols for arbitrary $\Omega_1$. In the vicinity of these points, heating is suppressed up to very long timescales in such driven systems, leading to a prethermal regime; we demonstrate this by exact numerical studies of distribution and bandwidth of the Floquet eigenstates, spectral form factor, entanglement entropy, and correlation functions of an experimentally realizable finite driven Rydberg chain. The corresponding micromotion exhibits coherent reversal of excitation reminiscent of echoes. Our analysis constitutes a yet unexplored mechanism for heating suppression in driven closed quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a distinction between two different concepts of time that play a role in physics: geometric time and creative time. The former is the time of deterministic physics and merely parametrizes a given evolution. The latter is instead characterized by real change, i.e. novel information that gets created when a non-necessary event becomes determined in a fundamentally indeterministic physics. This allows us to give a naturalistic characterization of the present as the moment that separates the potential future from the determined past. We discuss how these two concepts find natural applications in classical and intuitionistic mathematics, respectively, and in classical and multivalued tensed logic, as well as how they relate to the well-known A- and B-theories in the philosophy of time.</description>

      <title>Slow relaxation of quasi-periodically driven integrable quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence and stability of a prethermal phase in an integrable many-body system subjected to a Fibonacci drive. Despite not being periodic, Fibonacci drives have been shown to introduce dynamical constraints due to their self-similar structure, unlike random driving protocols. From perturbative analysis, this has been argued to result in an exponentially long prethermal phase in the high frequency limit of driving. Examining higher order terms in the perturbative expansion, we show that the perturbative description breaks down eventually in such systems at a finite universal order, which depends solely on features of the Fibonacci sequence. This leads to an onset of energy absorption at long time scales for intermediate and low driving frequencies. Interestingly, in spite of the breakdown of an effective Hamiltonian in the perturbative analysis, we still observe slow logarithmic heating time-scales, unlike purely random drives.</description>

      <title>Quantum Isotropic Universe in RQM Analogy: the Cosmological Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the presence of a free massless scalar field, playing the role of a physical clock. The Hilbert space is constructed via a direct analogy between the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace and a relativistic scalar one in physical space. In particular, we show how the introduction of a "turning point" in the Universe evolution allows to overcome an intrinsic ambiguity in representing the expanding and collapsing Universe. In this way, the positive and negative frequencies are simply identified with time reversed states. The main subject of the present analysis is the construction of a horizon operator, whose quantum behavior is investigated when Polymer Quantum Mechanics is implemented to describe the asymptotic evolution near the initial singularity. The reason of this choice is motivated by the intrinsic spreading of localized wavepackets when the polymer dispersion relation governs the quantum dynamics. The evidence that the mean value of the quantum horizon operator follows its semiclassical behavior (corrected for polymerization) is a clear indication that a concept of causality can be restored also in the quantum cosmological picture.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space representation for quasi-Hermitian position-deformed Heisenberg algebra and Path integral formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Renes proposed a quantum algorithm called belief propagation with quantum messages (BPQM) for decoding classical data encoded using a binary linear code with tree Tanner graph that is transmitted over a pure-state CQ channel [Renes, NJP 19 072001 (2017)]. The algorithm presents a genuine quantum counterpart to decoding based on the classical belief propagation algorithm, which has found wide success in classical coding theory when used in conjunction with LDPC or Turbo codes. More recently Rengaswamy et al. [npj Quantum Information 7 97 (2021)] observed that BPQM implements the optimal decoder on a small example code. Here we significantly expand the understanding, formalism, and applicability of the BPQM algorithm with the following contributions. First, we prove analytically that BPQM realizes optimal decoding for any binary linear code with tree Tanner graph. We also provide the first formal description of the BPQM algorithm in full detail and without any ambiguity. In so doing, we identify a key flaw overlooked in the original algorithm and subsequent works which implies quantum circuit realizations will be exponentially large in the code dimension. Although BPQM passes quantum messages, other information required by the algorithm is processed globally. We remedy this problem by formulating a truly message-passing algorithm which approximates BPQM and has quantum circuit complexity $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly } n, \text{polylog } \frac{1}{\epsilon})$, where $n$ is the code length and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. Finally, we also propose a novel method for extending BPQM to factor graphs containing cycles by making use of approximate cloning. We show some promising numerical results that indicate that BPQM on factor graphs with cycles can significantly outperform the best possible classical decoder.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounding Ground-State Energies of Local Hamiltonians Through the Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a renormalization scheme, we show how to formulate a tractable convex relaxation of the set of feasible local density matrices of a many-body quantum system. The relaxation is obtained by introducing a hierarchy of constraints between the reduced states of ever-growing sets of lattice sites. The coarse-graining maps of the underlying renormalization procedure serve to eliminate a vast number of those constraints, such that the remaining ones can be enforced with reasonable computational means. This can be used to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the ground state energy of arbitrary local Hamiltonians, by performing a linear optimization over the resulting convex relaxation of reduced quantum states. The quality of the bounds crucially depends on the particular renormalization scheme, which must be tailored to the target Hamiltonian. We apply our method to 1D translation-invariant spin models, obtaining energy bounds comparable to those attained by optimizing over locally translation-invariant states of $n\gtrsim 100$ spins. Beyond this demonstration, the general method can be applied to a wide range of other problems, such as spin systems in higher spatial dimensions, electronic structure problems, and various other many-body optimization problems, such as entanglement and nonlocality detection.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation advantage over classical memory limitations would allow compact quantum circuits to yield insight into intractable quantum many-body problems, but the interrelated obstacles of large circuit depth in quantum time evolution and noise seem to rule out unbiased quantum simulation in the near term. We prove that classical post-processing, i.e., long-time filtering of an offline time series, exponentially improves the circuit depth needed for quantum time evolution. We apply the filtering method to the construction of a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to estimate energy gap, an important observable not governed by the variational theorem. We demonstrate, within an operating range of filtering, the success of the algorithm in proof-of-concept simulation for finite-size scaling of a minimal spin model. Our findings set the stage for unbiased quantum simulation to offer memory advantage in the near term.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Classification in Credit Sales Risk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data classification task is broadly utilized in numerous fields of science and it may be realized by different known approaches (e.g. neural networks). However, in this work, quantum computations were harnessed to solve the problem. We take into consideration a quantum circuit which is based on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and so-called SWAP-Test what allows us to solve a classification problem connected with credit sales. More specifically, we cope with a decision problem of determining customer's reliability based on values of selected decision variables (e.g. generated turnover, history of cooperation).
  The classical data samples are converted into normalized quantum states. After this operation, samples may be processed by a circuit of quantum gates. The VQE approach allows training the parameters of a quantum circuit (so-called ansatz) to output pattern-states for each class. In the utilized data set, two classes may be observed -- cases with low and high credit risk. However, the VQE circuit differentiates more classes than two (introduces more detailed cases) and the final results are obtained with the use of aforementioned SWAP-Test. The elaborated solution is compact and requires only logarithmically increasing number of qubits (due to the exponential capacity of quantum registers).
  Because of the low complexity of the presented quantum circuit, it is possible to perform experiments on currently available quantum computers, including the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. This type of devices, despite the presence of noise, is capable of solving the task analyzed in this work. All calculations, simulations, plots, and comparisons were implemented and conduced in the Python language environment. Source codes for each example of quantum classification can be found in the source code repository.</description>

      <title>Tuning the separability in noncommutative space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Separability of the noncommutative (NC) space coordinate degrees of freedom with the generalized Peres-Horodecki separability criterion (Simon's condition) for a bipartite Gaussian state. Non-symplectic nature of the transformation between the usual commutative space and NC space restricts the use of Simon's condition in NCS. We transform the NCS system to an equivalent Hamiltonian in commutative space through Bopp shift, which enables the utilization of the separability criterion in NC space. For afairly general study, we consider a bilinear Hamiltonian with time-dependent (TD) parameters, along with a TD external interaction, which is linear in field modes. The system is transformed into canonical form keeping the intrinsic symplectic structure ($Sp(4,\mathbb{R})$) intact. The solution of the TD-Schr\"{o}dinger equation is obtained with the help of Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method (LRIM). Expectation values of the observables (thus the covariance matrix ) are constructed from the states obtained from LRIM. It turns out that the existence of the NC parameters in the oscillator determines the separability of the states. In particular, for isotropic oscillators, the separability condition for the bipartite Gaussian states depends on NC parameters. Moreover, anisotropic parameter values for the oscillator affects the separability. In other words, both the deformation parameters ($\theta,\;\eta$) and parameter values of the oscillator are important for the separability of bipartite states. Thus tuning the parameter values, one can destroy or recreate the separability of states. With the help of toy models, we have demonstrated TD-NC space parameters effect on separability.</description>

Abstract: Random ensembles of pure states have proven to be extremely important in various aspects of quantum physics such as benchmarking the performance of quantum circuits, testing for quantum advantage, providing novel insights for many-body thermalization and studying the black hole information paradox. Although generating a fully random ensemble is experimentally challenging, approximations of it are just as useful and are known to emerge naturally in a variety of physical models, including Rydberg setups. These are referred to as approximate quantum state designs, and verifying their degree of randomness can be an expensive task, similar to performing full quantum state tomography on many-body systems. In this theoretical work, we efficiently validate the character of approximate quantum designs with respect to data size acquisition when compared to the conventional frequentist approach. This is achieved by translating the information residing in the complex many-body state into a succinct representation of classical data using a random projective measurement basis, which is then processed using methods of statistical inference such as maximum likelihood estimation and neural networks and benchmarked against the predictions of shadow tomography. Our scheme of combining machine learning methods for postprocessing the data obtained from randomized measurements for efficient characterisation of (approximate) quantum state k designs is applicable to any noisy quantum platform that can generate quantum designs.</description>

Abstract: High-precision remote clock synchronization is crucial for many classical and quantum network applications. Evaluating options for space-Earth links, we find that traditional solutions may not produce the desired synchronization for low Earth orbits and unnecessarily complicate quantum-networking architectures. Demonstrating an alternative, we use commercial off-the-shelf quantum-photon sources and detection equipment to synchronize two remote clocks across our freespace testbed utilizing a method called two-way quantum time transfer (QTT). We reach picosecond-scale timing precision under very lossy and noisy channel conditions representative of daytime space-Earth links and software-emulated satellite motion. This work demonstrates how QTT is potentially relevant for daytime space-Earth quantum networking and/or providing high-precision timing in GPS-denied environments.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Transmission Through a Classical Analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm Ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been predicted that new physics and technology are enabled for quantum systems that suffer from partial decoherence, in the intermediate range between coherent quantum evolution and incoherent classical physics. We explore the asymmetric transmission through a classical analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) mesoscopic ring that supports a 3:1 asymmetry in transmission times, augmented with lossy features that act preferentially on the longer-lingering waves. Such a device is realized as a linear microwave graph utilizing a gyrator to create the 3:1 transmission time delay asymmetry, along with both homogeneous and localized losses, to produce an imbalance in wave transmission through the device. We demonstrate asymmetric transmission through the microwave-ring graph as a function of loss in both simulation and experiment, and in both the frequency- and time-domain. The microwave ring-graph results are compared to a numerical simulation representative of a class of recent models proposing dephasing-induced transport asymmetry in few-channel quantum systems, and parallels are noted.</description>

Abstract: In a quantum change point problem, a source emitting particles in a fixed quantum state (default) switches to a different state at some stage, and the objective is to identify when the change happened by measuring a sequence of particles emitted from such a source. Motivated by entanglement-sharing protocols in quantum information, we study this problem within the paradigm of local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Here, we consider a source that emits entangled pairs in a default state, but starts producing another entangled state (mutation) at a later stage. Then, a sequence of entangled pairs prepared from such a source and shared between distant observers cannot be used for quantum information processing tasks as the identity of each entangled pair remains unknown. We show that identifying the change point using LOCC leads to the distillation of free entangled pairs. In particular, if the default and the mutation are mutually orthogonal, there exists an efficient LOCC protocol that identifies the change point without fail and distills a sufficiently large number of pairs. However, if they are nonorthogonal, there is a probability of failure. In this case, we compute the number of entangled pairs that may be obtained on average. We also consider a relaxation of the two-state problem where the mutation is not known a priori, but instead belongs to a known set. Here we show that local distinguishability plays a crucial role: if the default and the possible mutations are locally distinguishable, the problem reduces to the two-state problem with orthogonal states, but if not, one may still identify the mutation, the change point, and distill entanglement, as we illustrate with a concrete example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of mode hybridization and calculation of radiative relaxation rates have been crucial to the design and optimization of superconducting quantum devices. In this work, we introduce a spectral theory for the electrohydrodynamics of superconductors that enables the extraction of the relaxation rates of excitations in a general three-dimensional distribution of superconducting bodies. Our approach addresses the long-standing problem of formulating a modal description of open systems that is both efficient and allows for second quantization of the radiative hybridized fields. This is achieved through the implementation of finite but transparent boundaries through which radiation can propagate into and out of the computational domain. The resulting spectral problem is defined within a coarse-grained formulation of the electrohydrodynamical equations that is suitable for the analysis of the non-equilibrium dynamics of multiscale superconducting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study states with intrinsic topological order subjected to local decoherence from the perspective of separability, i.e., whether a decohered mixed state can be expressed as an ensemble of short-range entangled (SRE) pure states. We focus on toric codes and the X-cube fracton state and provide evidence for the existence of decoherence-induced separability transitions that precisely coincide with the threshold for the feasibility of active error correction. A key insight is that local decoherence acting on the 'parent' cluster states of these models results in a Gibbs state. As an example, for the 2d (3d) toric code subjected to bit-flip errors, we show that the decohered density matrix can be written as a convex sum of SRE states for $p &gt; p_c$, where $p_c$ is related to the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the 2d (3d) random-field bond Ising model along the Nishimori line.</description>

      <title>Tridiagonal matrix decomposition for Hamiltonian simulation on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of quantum circuits to simulate Hamiltonian evolution is central to many quantum algorithms. State-of-the-art circuits are based on oracles whose implementation is often omitted, and the complexity of the algorithm is estimated by counting oracle queries. However, in practical applications, an oracle implementation contributes a large constant factor to the overall complexity of the algorithm. The key finding of this work is the efficient procedure for representation of a tridiagonal matrix in the Pauli basis, which allows one to construct a Hamiltonian evolution circuit without the use of oracles. The procedure represents a general tridiagonal matrix $2^n \times 2^n$ by systematically determining all Pauli strings present in the decomposition, dividing them into commuting subsets. The efficiency is in the number of commuting subsets $O(n)$. The method is demonstrated using the one-dimensional wave equation, verifying numerically that the gate complexity as function of the number of qubits is lower than the oracle based approach for $n &lt; 15$ and requires half the number of qubits. This method is applicable to other Hamiltonians based on the tridiagonal matrices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement has long served as a foundational pillar in understanding quantum mechanics, with a predominant focus on two-particle systems. We extend the study of entanglement into the realm of three-body decays, offering a more intricate understanding of quantum correlations. We introduce a novel approach for three-particle systems by utilising the principles of entanglement monotone concurrence and the monogamy property. Our findings highlight the potential of studying deviations from the Standard Model and emphasise its significance in particle phenomenology. This work paves the way for new insights into particle physics through multi-particle quantum entanglement, particularly in decays of heavy fermions and hadrons.</description>

      <title>Absence of barren plateaus in finite local-depth circuits with long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01393v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground state preparation is classically intractable for general Hamiltonians. On quantum devices, shallow parameterized circuits can be effectively trained to obtain short-range entangled states under the paradigm of variational quantum eigensolver, while deep circuits are generally untrainable due to the barren plateau phenomenon. In this Letter, we give a general lower bound on the variance of circuit gradients for arbitrary quantum circuits composed of local 2-designs. Based on our unified framework, we prove the absence of barren plateaus in training finite local-depth circuits (FLDC) for the ground states of local Hamiltonians. FLDCs are allowed to be deep in the conventional circuit depth to generate long-range entangled ground states, such as topologically ordered states, but their local depths are finite, i.e., there is only a finite number of gates acting on individual qubits. This characteristic sets FLDC apart from shallow circuits: FLDC in general cannot be classically simulated to estimate local observables efficiently by existing tensor network methods in two and higher dimensions. We validate our analytical results with extensive numerical simulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of variational training using the generalized toric code model.</description>

      <title>Theory of Compression Channels for Post-selected Quantum Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-selected quantum metrological scheme is especially advantageous when the final measurements are either very noisy or expensive in practical experiments. In this work, we put forward a general theory on the compression channels in post-selected metrology. We define the basic notions characterizing the compression quality and illuminate the underlying structure of lossless compression channels. Previous experiments on post-selected optical phase estimation and weak-value amplification are shown to be particular cases of this general theory. Furthermore, for two categories of bipartite systems, we show that the compression loss can be made arbitrarily small even when the compression channel acts only on one subsystem. These findings can be employed to distribute quantum measurements so that the measurement noise and cost are dramatically reduced.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transition due to Feedback-induced Skin Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional dynamical phase transition refers to the appearance of singularities in an observable with respect to a control parameter for a late-time state or singularities in the rate function of the Loschmidt echo with respect to time. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical phase transition from a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a transition for the steady state, a transition occurs for the maximum entanglement entropy during the time evolution, which agrees well with the entanglement transition for the steady state of the dynamics under periodic boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the behavior of a non-Hermitian opened one-dimensional quantum system with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. This system is built by a dimer, with balanced gains and losses described by a parameter $\gamma$. By varying $\gamma$ the system resonances, which are naturally separated, coalesce at the exceptional point (EP). The transmission spectrum is obtained by means of the scattering matrix ($S$ matrix) formalism and we examine the wave functions corresponding to the resonances as a function of $\gamma$. Specifically, we look for the behavior and distribution of the phases of the $S$ matrix before, at and after the EP.</description>

      <title>First Hitting Times on a Quantum Computer: Tracking vs. Local Monitoring, Topological Effects, and Dark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum walk on a ring represented by a directed triangle graph with complex edge weights and monitored at a constant rate until the quantum walker is detected. To this end, the first hitting time statistics is recorded using unitary dynamics interspersed stroboscopically by measurements, which is implemented on IBM quantum computers with a midcircuit readout option. Unlike classical hitting times, the statistical aspect of the problem depends on the way we construct the measured path, an effect that we quantify experimentally. First, we experimentally verify the theoretical prediction that the mean return time to a target state is quantized, with abrupt discontinuities found for specific sampling times and other control parameters, which has a well-known topological interpretation. Second, depending on the initial state, system parameters, and measurement protocol, the detection probability can be less than one or even zero, which is related to dark-state physics. Both, return-time quantization and the appearance of the dark states are related to degeneracies in the eigenvalues of the unitary time evolution operator. We conclude that, for the IBM quantum computer under study, the first hitting times of monitored quantum walks are resilient to noise. Yet, a finite number of measurements leads to broadening effects, which modify the topological quantization and chiral effects of the asymptotic theory with an infinite number of measurements. Our results point the way for the development of novel quantum walk algorithms that exploit measurement-induced effects on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Recovering quantum coherence of a cavity qubit through environment monitoring and active feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence in qubits, caused by their interaction with a noisy environment, poses a significant challenge to developing reliable quantum processors. Monitoring the qubit's environment enables not only to identify decoherence events but also to reverse these errors, thereby restoring the qubit coherence. This approach is particularly beneficial for superconducting cavity qubits, whose unavoidable interaction with auxiliary transmons impacts their coherence. In this work, we uncover the intricate dynamics of cavity decoherence by tracking the noisy trajectory of a transmon acting as the cavity's environment. Using real-time feedback, we successfully recover the lost coherence of the cavity qubit, achieving a fivefold increase in its dephasing time. Alternatively, by detecting transmon errors and converting them into erasures, we improve the cavity phase coherence by more than an order of magnitude. These advances are essential for implementing long-lived cavity qubits with high-fidelity gates and can enable more efficient bosonic quantum error correction codes.</description>

      <title>A quantum expectation identity: Applications to statistical mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we derive a useful expectation identity using the language of quantum statistical mechanics, where density matrices represent the state of knowledge about the system. This identity allows to establish relations between different quantum observables depending on a continuous parameter. Such a parameter can be contained in the observables itself (e.g. perturbative parameter) or may appear as a Lagrange multiplier (inverse temperature, chemical potential, etc.) in the density matrix, excluding parameters that modify the underlying Hilbert space. In this way, using both canonical and grand canonical density matrices along with certain quantum observables (Hamiltonian, number operator, etc.) we found new identities in the field, showing not only its derivation but also its meaning. Additionally, we found that some theorems of traditional quantum statistics and quantum chemistry, such as the thermodynamical fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the Ehrenfest, and the Hellmann-Feynman theorems, among others, are particular instances of our aforementioned quantum expectation identity. At last, using a generalized density matrix arising from the Maximum-Entropy principle, we derive generalized quantum expectation identities: these generalized identities allow us to group all the previous cases in a unitary scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is an important feature of our existing physical theories that observables generate one-parameter groups of transformations. In classical Hamiltonian mechanics and quantum mechanics, this is due to the fact that the observables form a Lie algebra, and it manifests itself in Noether's theorem. In this paper, we introduce Lie quandles as the minimal mathematical structure needed to express the idea that observables generate transformations. This is based on the notion of a quandle used most famously in knot theory, whose main defining property is the self-distributivity equation $x \triangleright (y \triangleright z) = (x \triangleright y) \triangleright (x \triangleright z)$. We argue that Lie quandles can be thought of as nonlinear generalizations of Lie algebras.
  We also observe that taking convex combinations of points in vector spaces, which physically corresponds to mixing states, satisfies the same form of self-distributivity.</description>

Abstract: Linear-optics gates, the enabling tool of photonic quantum information processing, depend on indistinguishable photons, as they harness quantum interference to achieve nonlinear operations. Yet, the required indistinguishability is related to the symmetry of the multiphoton wavefunction, and does not necessarily imply identical photons. Here, we show for the case of two-photon gates that the ideal gate operation can be retrieved if one can guarantee the exchange symmetry of the input photonic state. Specifically, we employ a temporal quantum eraser to allow fusion gates with sources of modally-impure photons: parametric photon pair generation and single-photon extraction by a single quantum emitter. The ability to lift the requirement for identical photons bears considerable potential in linear-optics quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: With a high-loss resonator supplying the non-Hermiticity, we study the Energy level degeneracy and quantum state evolution in tunable coupling superconducting quantum circuit. The qubit's effective energy level and damping rate can be continually tuned in superconducting circuit, and the positions and numbers of level degenerate points are controllable. The efficient of quantum state exchange and the asymmetry of quantum state evolution can be tuned with non-hermitian and nonreciprocal coupling between two qubits. The controllable non-Hermiticity provides new insights and methods for exploring the unconventional quantum effects in superconducting quantum circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer qubits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent demonstration of optically active telecom emitters makes silicon a compelling candidate for solid state quantum photonic platforms. Particularly fabrication of the G center has been demonstrated in carbon-rich silicon upon conventional thermal annealing. However, the high-yield controlled fabrication of these emitters at the wafer-scale still requires the identification of a suitable thermodynamic pathway enabling its activation following ion implantation. Here we demonstrate the efficient activation of G centers in high-purity silicon substrates upon ns pulsed laser annealing. The proposed method enables the non-invasive, localized activation of G centers by the supply of short non-stationary pulses, thus overcoming the limitations of conventional rapid thermal annealing related to the structural metastability of the emitters. A finite-element analysis highlights the strong non-stationarity of the technique, offering radically different defect-engineering capabilities with respect to conventional longer thermal treatments, paving the way to the direct and controlled fabrication of emitters embedded in integrated photonic circuits and waveguides.</description>

Abstract: Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the $2D$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of spin-1/2 fermions. The method consists of a Ramsey sequence where both spin states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.</description>

Abstract: We discuss Riemannian geometry of one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Its wavefunction is a holomorphic section of the complex line bundle $L_{\sf{v}}$ over the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that the energy eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ with $n\ge 1$, corresponding to the energy levels $E_n$, are complex coordinates on orbifolds $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ embedded into $L_{\sf{v}}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$. In fact, $\psi_n (t,z)$ is a standing wave on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $z$ is a complex coordinate on the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{C}$. Oscillators are characterized by two quantum charges $(q_l^{}, q_{\sf{v}})=(n,1)$, where $q_l^{}=n$ is the winding number for the group U(1) acting on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $q_{\sf{v}}^{}=1$ is the winding number for the U(1)-rotations on fibres of the bundle $L_{\sf{v}}\to\mathbb{R}^2$, and $E_n=\hbar\omega(q_l^{}+\frac{1}{2} q_{\sf{v}}).$ We also discuss "antioscillators" with opposite quantum charges and the same positive energy.</description>
