      <title>Network Embedding Analysis for Anti-Money Laundering Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ network embedding to detect money laundering in financial transaction networks. Using real anonymized banking data, we model over one million accounts as a directed graph and use it to refine previously detected suspicious cycles with node2vec embeddings, creating a new network parameter, the spread number. Combined with more traditional centrality measures, these define an aggregate score $R$ that highlights so-called anti-central nodes: accounts that are structurally important yet organized to avoid detection. Our results show only a small subset of cycles attain high $R$ values, flagging concentrated groups of suspicious accounts. Our approach demonstrates the potential of embedding-based network analysis to expose laundering strategies that evade traditional graph centrality measures.</description>

      <title>Socially-Informed Content Analysis of Online Human Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of social media has not only revolutionized communication but also brought challenges such as political polarization, misinformation, hate speech, and echo chambers. This dissertation employs computational social science techniques to investigate these issues, understand the social dynamics driving negative online behaviors, and propose data-driven solutions for healthier digital interactions. I begin by introducing a scalable social network representation learning method that integrates user-generated content with social connections to create unified user embeddings, enabling accurate prediction and visualization of user attributes, communities, and behavioral propensities. Using this tool, I explore three interrelated problems: 1) COVID-19 discourse on Twitter, revealing polarization and asymmetric political echo chambers; 2) online hate speech, suggesting the pursuit of social approval motivates toxic behavior; and 3) moral underpinnings of COVID-19 discussions, uncovering patterns of moral homophily and echo chambers, while also indicating moral diversity and plurality can improve message reach and acceptance across ideological divides. These findings contribute to the advancement of computational social science and provide a foundation for understanding human behavior through the lens of social interactions and network homophily.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce YTCommentVerse, a large-scale multilingual and multi-category dataset of YouTube comments. It contains over 32 million comments from 178,000 videos contributed by more than 20 million unique users spanning 15 distinct YouTube content categories such as Music, News, Education and Entertainment. Each comment in the dataset includes video and comment IDs, user channel details, upvotes and category labels. With comments in over 50 languages, YTCommentVerse provides a rich resource for exploring sentiment, toxicity and engagement patterns across diverse cultural and topical contexts. This dataset helps fill a major gap in publicly available social media datasets particularly for analyzing video sharing platforms by combining multiple languages, detailed categories and other metadata.</description>

      <title>Fast Percolation Centrality Approximation with Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present PercIS, an algorithm based on Importance Sampling to approximate the percolation centrality of all the nodes of a graph. Percolation centrality is a generalization of betweenness centrality to attributed graphs, and is a useful measure to quantify the importance of the vertices in a contagious process or to diffuse information. However, it is impractical to compute it exactly on modern-sized networks.
  First, we highlight key limitations of state-of-the-art sampling-based approximation methods for the percolation centrality, showing that in most cases they cannot achieve accurate solutions efficiently. Then, we propose and analyze a novel sampling algorithm based on Importance Sampling, proving tight sample size bounds to achieve high-quality approximations.
  Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that PercIS computes high-quality estimates and scales to large real-world networks, while significantly outperforming, in terms of sample sizes, accuracy and running times, the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>No Community Detection Method to Rule Them All!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection is a core tool for analyzing large realworld graphs. It is often used to derive additional local features of vertices and edges that will be used to perform a downstream task, yet the impact of community detection on downstream tasks is poorly understood. Prior work largely evaluates community detection algorithms by their intrinsic objectives (e.g., modularity). Or they evaluate the impact of using community detection onto on the downstream task. But the impact of particular community detection algortihm support the downstream task. We study the relationship between community structure and downstream performance across multiple algorithms and two tasks. Our analysis links community-level properties to task metrics (F1, precision, recall, AUC) and reveals that the choice of detection method materially affects outcomes. We explore thousands of community structures and show that while the properties of communities are the reason behind the impact on task performance, no single property explains performance in a direct way. Rather, results emerge from complex interactions among properties. As such, no standard community detection algorithm will derive the best downstream performance. We show that a method combining random community generation and simple machine learning techniques can derive better performance</description>

      <title>The threshold and quasi-stationary distribution for the SIS model on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model on arbitrary networks. The well-established pair approximation treats neighboring pairs of nodes exactly while making a mean field approximation for the rest of the network. We improve the method by expanding the state space dynamically, giving nodes a memory of when they last became susceptible. The resulting approximation is simple to implement and appears to be highly accurate, both in locating the epidemic threshold and in computing the quasi-stationary fraction of infected individuals above the threshold, for both finite graphs and infinite random graphs.</description>

      <title>Percolation and matrix spectrum through NIB message passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given its computational efficiency and versatility, belief propagation is the most prominent message passing method in several applications. In order to diminish the damaging effect of loops on its accuracy, the first explicit version of generalized belief propagation for networks, the KCN-method, was recently introduced. This approach was originally developed in the context of two target problems: percolation and the calculation of the spectra of sparse matrices. Later on, the KCN-method was extended in order to deal with inference in the context of probabilistic graphical models on networks. It was in this scenario where an improvement on the KCN-method, the NIB-method, was conceived. We show here that this improvement can also achieved in the original applications of the KCN-method, namely percolation and matrix spectra.</description>

      <title>Fostering cultural change in research through innovative knowledge sharing, evaluation, and community engagement strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific research needs a new system that appropriately values science and scientists. Key innovations, within institutions and funding agencies, are driving better assessment of research, with open knowledge and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles as central pillars. Furthermore, coalitions, agreements, and robust infrastructures have emerged to promote more accurate assessment metrics and efficient knowledge sharing. However, despite these efforts, the system still relies on outdated methods where standardized metrics such as h-index and journal impact factor dominate evaluations. These metrics have had the unintended consequence of pushing researchers to produce more outputs at the expense of integrity and reproducibility. In this community paper, we bring together a global community of researchers, funding institutions, industrial partners, and publishers from 14 different countries across the 5 continents. We aim at collectively envision an evolved knowledge sharing and research evaluation along with the potential positive impact on every stakeholder involved. We imagine these ideas to set the groundwork for a cultural change to redefine a more fair and equitable scientific landscape.</description>

      <title>Agentic Username Suggestion and Multimodal Gender Detection in Online Platforms: Introducing the PNGT-26K Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persian names present unique challenges for natural language processing applications, particularly in gender detection and digital identity creation, due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns. Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names, while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000 tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset, Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on Github.</description>

      <title>A Transformer-Based Cross-Platform Analysis of Public Discourse on the 15-Minute City Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first multi-platform sentiment analysis of public opinion on the 15-minute city concept across Twitter, Reddit, and news media. Using compressed transformer models and Llama-3-8B for annotation, we classify sentiment across heterogeneous text domains. Our pipeline handles long-form and short-form text, supports consistent annotation, and enables reproducible evaluation. We benchmark five models (DistilRoBERTa, DistilBERT, MiniLM, ELECTRA, TinyBERT) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, reporting F1-score, AUC, and training time. DistilRoBERTa achieved the highest F1 (0.8292), TinyBERT the best efficiency, and MiniLM the best cross-platform consistency. Results show News data yields inflated performance due to class imbalance, Reddit suffers from summarization loss, and Twitter offers moderate challenge. Compressed models perform competitively, challenging assumptions that larger models are necessary. We identify platform-specific trade-offs and propose directions for scalable, real-world sentiment classification in urban planning discourse.</description>

      <title>CognitiveSky: Scalable Sentiment and Narrative Analysis for Decentralized Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of decentralized social media platforms presents new opportunities and challenges for real-time analysis of public discourse. This study introduces CognitiveSky, an open-source and scalable framework designed for sentiment, emotion, and narrative analysis on Bluesky, a federated Twitter or X.com alternative. By ingesting data through Bluesky's Application Programming Interface (API), CognitiveSky applies transformer-based models to annotate large-scale user-generated content and produces structured and analyzable outputs. These summaries drive a dynamic dashboard that visualizes evolving patterns in emotion, activity, and conversation topics. Built entirely on free-tier infrastructure, CognitiveSky achieves both low operational cost and high accessibility. While demonstrated here for monitoring mental health discourse, its modular design enables applications across domains such as disinformation detection, crisis response, and civic sentiment analysis. By bridging large language models with decentralized networks, CognitiveSky offers a transparent, extensible tool for computational social science in an era of shifting digital ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Updating the Complex Systems Keyword Diagram Using Collective Feedback and Latest Literature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex systems keyword diagram generated by the author in 2010 has been used widely in a variety of educational and outreach purposes, but it definitely needs a major update and reorganization. This short paper reports our recent attempt to update the keyword diagram using information collected from the following multiple sources: (a) collective feedback posted on social media, (b) recent reference books on complex systems and network science, (c) online resources on complex systems, and (d) keyword search hits obtained using OpenAlex, an open-access bibliographic catalogue of scientific publications. The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's internal perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems. Four topical communities were obtained from the keyword association network, although they were highly intertwined with each other. We hope that the resulting network visualization of complex systems keywords provides a more up-to-date, accurate topic map of the field of complex systems as of today.</description>

      <title>Evidencing preferential attachment in dependency network evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preferential attachment is often suggested to be the underlying mechanism of the growth of a network, largely due to that many real networks are, to a certain extent, scale-free. However, such attribution is usually made under debatable practices of determining scale-freeness and when only snapshots of the degree distribution are observed. In the presence of the evolution history of the network, modelling the increments of the evolution allows us to measure preferential attachment directly. Therefore, we propose a generalised linear model for such purpose, where the in-degrees and their increments are the covariate and response, respectively. Not only are the parameters that describe the preferential attachment directly incorporated, they also ensure that the tail heaviness of the asymptotic degree distribution is realistic. The Bayesian approach to inference enables the hierarchical version of the model to be implemented naturally. The application to the dependency network of R packages reveals subtly different behaviours between new dependencies by new and existing packages, and between addition and removal of dependencies.</description>

      <title>Burger: Robust Graph Denoising-augmentation Fusion and Multi-semantic Modeling in Social Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Critical Nodes Identification in Complex Networks: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes: centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks</title>

Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM-Based Social Bot via an Adversarial Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing Large Language Model (LLM) agents that exhibit human-like behavior, encompassing not only individual heterogeneity rooted in unique user profiles but also adaptive response to socially connected neighbors, is a significant research challenge. Social media platforms, with their diverse user data and explicit social structures, provide an ideal testbed for such investigations. This paper introduces EvoBot, an \textbf{Evo}lving LLM-based social \textbf{Bot} that significantly enhances human-like generative capabilities through a novel adversarial learning framework. EvoBot is initialized by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on representative data from social media and then iteratively refines its generation of sophisticated, human-like content via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This refinement is guided by feedback from a co-adapting \textbf{Detector} which concurrently improves its ability to distinguish EvoBot from humans, thereby creating an increasingly challenging learning environment for EvoBot. Experiments demonstrate that EvoBot generates content aligned with diverse user profiles, increasingly bypassing the co-adapting Detector through human-like expression. Moreover, it exhibits strong social responsiveness, more accurately modeling real-world opinion dynamics and information spread in multi-agent simulations. The framework also yields a more robust Detector, underscoring its broader utility for both advanced agent development and related detection tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/kfq20/EvoBot.</description>

      <title>AI-in-the-Loop: Privacy Preserving Real-Time Scam Detection and Conversational Scambaiting by Leveraging LLMs and Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing, impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</description>
