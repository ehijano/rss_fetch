      <title>Physics-enhanced Neural Operator for Simulating Turbulent Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise simulation of turbulent flows is of immense importance in a variety of scientific and engineering fields, including climate science, freshwater science, and the development of energy-efficient manufacturing processes. Within the realm of turbulent flow simulation, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is widely considered to be the most reliable approach, but it is prohibitively expensive for long-term simulation at fine spatial scales. Given the pressing need for efficient simulation, there is an increasing interest in building machine learning models for turbulence, either by reconstructing DNS from alternative low-fidelity simulations or by predicting DNS based on the patterns learned from historical data. However, standard machine learning techniques remain limited in capturing complex spatio-temporal characteristics of turbulent flows, resulting in limited performance and generalizability. This paper presents a novel physics-enhanced neural operator (PENO) that incorporates physical knowledge of partial differential equations (PDEs) to accurately model flow dynamics. The model is further refined by a self-augmentation mechanism to reduce the accumulated error in long-term simulations. The proposed method is evaluated through its performance on two distinct sets of 3D turbulent flow data, showcasing the model's capability to reconstruct high-resolution DNS data, maintain the inherent physical properties of flow transport, and generate flow simulations across various resolutions. Additionally, experimental results on multiple 2D vorticity flow series, generated by different PDEs, highlight the transferability and generalizability of the proposed method. This confirms its applicability to a wide range of real-world scenarios in which extensive simulations are needed under diverse settings.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for prediction of vortex-induced vibration based on the nonlinear identification of general wake oscillator modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present novel identification strategies to develop a unified framework for vortex-induced vibration (VIV) prediction based on the general semi-empirical wake oscillator. Greybox nonlinear system identification method accompanying high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or experimental data could be applied for the identification process. The proposed template of general wake oscillators contains low- to high-order damping terms to be identified for characterizing the possible flow dynamics. Two different strategies, including individual identification of single wake oscillator and overall identification of coupled VIV control equations, are proposed. VIV system consisting of an elastically-mounted circular cylinder submerged in laminar flow at Reynold number of 100 is considered. Both strategies have been tested and have exhibited high accuracy. The second strategy, i.e., overall identification of coupled VIV control equations, would be more suitable for the future framework owing that its training process considers the effect of fluid damping. A detailed mathematical introduction to future works on framework development covering the wide Reynold number range is addressed. The proposed unified framework is a landmark update of past wake oscillators both in terms of prediction accuracy and physical principles and has considerable research significance and practical engineering value.</description>

      <title>Modulation instability in dispersive parity-broken systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the interplay between dispersive parity breaking and non-linearity in two contrasting continuous dynamical systems that exhibit Modulation Instability (MI). We begin by examining deep water odd surface gravity waves and derive the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) for the modulated envelope dynamics using the method of multiple scales. The parity breaking in the odd gravity waves results in distinct NLSEs for the right and the left mover, leading to chirality-dependent stability properties for the envelope dynamics. Moreover, the resonant interaction of gravity waves and odd viscosity-induced capillary dynamics creates a window of wave numbers in one of the chiral sectors where the envelope propagation remains stable. Following the odd gravity results, we design a one-dimensional non-reciprocal PT-symmetric dielectric model that exhibits parity-breaking effects that are analogous to the odd viscosity term in 2D hydrodynamics. With cubic non-linearity in the polarization dynamics, we derive the corresponding NLSE. Once again, we observe that parity breaking stabilizes the modulated envelope dynamics in the lower polariton bands. We then compare the similarities and differences between this case and that of odd gravity waves.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of instability in non-uniform dusty channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles in pressure-driven channel flow are often inhomogeneously distributed. Two modes of low-Reynolds number instability, absent in Poiseuille flow of clean fluid, are created by inhomogeneous particle loading, and their mechanism is worked out here. Two distinct classes of behaviour are seen: when the critical layer of the dominant perturbation overlaps with variations in particle concentration, the new instabilities arise, which we term overlap modes. But when the layers are distinct, only the traditional Tollmien-Schlichting mode of instability occurs. We derive the dominant critical layer balance equations in this flow along the lines done classically for clean fluid. These reveal how concentration variations within the critical layer cause two the particle-driven instabilities. As a result of these variations, disturbance kinetic energy production is qualitatively and majorly altered. Surprisingly the two overlap modes, though completely different in the symmetry of the eigenstructure and regime of exponential growth, show practically identical energy budgets, highlighting the relevance of variations within the critical layer. The wall layer is shown to be unimportant. We derive a minimal composite theory comprising all terms in the complete equation which are dominant somewhere in the flow, and show that it contains the essential physics.
  When particles are infinitely dense relative to the fluid, the volume fraction is negligible. But for finite density ratios, the volume fraction of particles causes a profile of effective viscosity. This is shown to be uniformly stabilizing in the present flow. Gravity is neglected here, and will be important to study in future. So will transient growth of perturbations due to non-normality of the stability operator, in a quest for the mechanism of transition to turbulence.</description>

      <title>Physically consistent immersed boundary method: a framework for predicting hydrodynamic forces on particles with coarse meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, a fluid-particle coupling method is directly derived from the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) by applying the concept of volume-filtering, yielding a physically consistent methodology to incorporate solid wall boundary conditions in the volume-filtered flow solution, thereby allowing to solve the governing flow equations on non-body conforming meshes. The resulting methodology possesses similarities with a continuous forcing immersed boundary method (IBM) and is, therefore, termed physically consistent IBM (PC-IBM). Based on the recent findings of arXiv:2402.05842v1, the closures arising in the volume-filtered NSE are closed by suitable models or even expressed analytically. The PC-IBM is fully compatible with the large eddy simulation framework, as the volume-filtered NSE converge to the filtered NSE away from solid boundaries. The potential of the PC-IBM is demonstrated by means of different particle-laden flow applications, including a dense packing of fixed particles and periodic settling of 500 particles. The new methodology turns out to be capable of accurately predicting the fluid forces on particles with relatively coarse mesh resolutions. For the flow around isolated spheres, a spatial resolution of six fluid mesh cells per diameter is sufficient to predict the drag force with less than 10% deviation from highly resolved simulation for the investigated particle Reynolds numbers ranging from 10 to 250.</description>

      <title>Regular sloshing modes in irregular cavities using metabathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation, combining numerical simulations and experimental measurements, into the manipulation of water waves and resonance characteristics within closed cavities utilizing anisotropic metamaterials. We engineer the anisotropic media with subwavelength-scale layered bathymetry through the application of coordinate transformation theory and the homogenization technique to a fully three-dimensional linear water wave problem. Experimental and numerical analyses of deformed cavities employing anisotropic metamaterial bathymetry demonstrate regular sloshing mode patterns and eigenfrequencies akin to those observed in rectangular reference cavities with flat bathymetry. Our study underscores the potential of water wave metamaterials in establishing robust anisotropic metabathymetry for the precise control of sloshing modes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for nonlinear differential equations and turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large spectrum of problems in classical physics and engineering, such as turbulence, is governed by nonlinear differential equations, which typically require high-performance computing to be solved. Over the past decade, however, the growth of classical computing power has slowed down because the miniaturisation of chips has been approaching the atomic scale. This is marking an end to Moore's law, which calls for a new computing paradigm: Quantum computing is a prime candidate. In this paper, we offer a perspective on the current challenges that need to be overcome in order to use quantum computing for the simulation of nonlinear dynamics. We review and discuss progress in the development of both quantum algorithms for nonlinear equations and quantum hardware. We propose pairings between quantum algorithms for nonlinear equations and quantum hardware concepts. These avenues open new opportunities for the simulation of nonlinear systems and turbulence.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion models for synthetic trajectories of heavy and light particles in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy and light particles are commonly found in many natural phenomena and industrial processes, such as suspensions of bubbles, dust, and droplets in incompressible turbulent flows. Based on a recent machine learning approach using a diffusion model that successfully generated single tracer trajectories in three-dimensional turbulence and passed most statistical benchmarks across time scales, we extend this model to include heavy and light particles. Given the particle type - tracer, light, or heavy - the model can generate synthetic, realistic trajectories with correct fat-tail distributions for acceleration, anomalous power laws, and scale dependent local slope properties. This work paves the way for future exploration of the use of diffusion models to produce high-quality synthetic datasets for different flow configurations, potentially allowing interpolation between different setups and adaptation to new conditions.</description>

      <title>The wind-shade roughness model for turbulent wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To aid in prediction of turbulent boundary layer flows over rough surfaces, a new model is proposed to estimate hydrodynamic roughness based solely on geometric surface information. The model is based on a fluid-mechanics motivated geometric parameter called the wind-shade factor. Sheltering is included using a rapid algorithm adapted from the landscape shadow literature, while local pressure drag is estimated using a piecewise potential flow approximation. Similarly to evaluating traditional surface parameters such as skewness or average slope magnitude, the wind-shade factor is purely geometric and can be evaluated efficiently from knowing the surface elevation map and the mean flow direction. The wind-shade roughness model is applied to over 100 different surfaces available in a public roughness database and some others, and the predicted sandgrain-roughness heights are compared to measured values. Effects of various model ingredients are analyzed, and transitionally rough surfaces are treated by adding a term representing the viscous stress component.</description>

      <title>Correlations among physical properties of pervious concrete with different aggregate sizes and mix proportions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permeable pavement material can benefit urban environment. Here in this work, different aggregate sizes and mix proportions were used to manufacture pervious pavement concrete and investigate correlations among its properties. The porosity, permeability, compressive strength, inner structure, thermal conductivity, and abrasion resistance of the specimens were obtained. Results showed lower aggregate-to-cement ratios and higher water-to-cement ratios led to porosity reduction, which decreased the permeability coefficient but increased the compressive strength, thermal conductivity, and abrasion resistance of the pervious concrete. Compared to the mixes, the aggregate sizes affected the physical properties of pervious concrete less. However, the sizes of pores and cement in the pervious concrete were more affected by aggregate sizes than by mixes. Moreover, the porosity, permeability coefficient, and compressive strength of the pervious concrete can be correlated by the power law, whereas the correlation between the porosity and abrasion resistance index can be fitted by a linear law.</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation for a velocity field based on the spherical Clebsch wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for preparing the quantum state for a given velocity field, e.g., in fluid dynamics, via the spherical Clebsch wave function (SCWF). Using the pointwise normalization constraint for the SCWF, we develop a variational ansatz comprising parameterized controlled rotation gates. Employing the variational quantum algorithm, we iteratively optimize the circuit parameters to transform the target velocity field into the SCWF and its corresponding discrete quantum state, enabling subsequent quantum simulation of fluid dynamics. Validations for one- and two-dimensional flow fields confirm the accuracy and robustness of our method, emphasizing its effectiveness in handling multiscale and multidimensional velocity fields. Our method is able to capture critical flow features like sources, sinks, and saddle points. Furthermore, it enables the generation of SCWFs for various vector fields, which can then be applied in quantum simulations through SCWF evolution.</description>

      <title>Effect of Feathers on Drag in Plunge Diving Birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of feathers on the hydrodynamic drag experienced by diving birds, which is critical to their foraging efficiency and survival. Employing a novel experimental approach, we analyzed the kinematics of both feathered and non-feathered projectiles during their transition from air to water using high-speed imaging and an onboard accelerometer. The drag coefficients were determined through two methods: a direct calculation from the acceleration data and a theoretical approach fitted to the observed velocity profiles. Our results indicate that feathers significantly increase the drag force during water entry, with feathered projectiles exhibiting approximately double the drag coefficient of their smooth counterparts. These findings provide new insights into the role of avian feather morphology in diving mechanics and have potential implications for the design of bio-inspired aquatic vehicles in engineering. The study also discusses the biological implications of increased drag due to feathers and suggests that factors such as body shape might play a more critical role in the diving capabilities of birds than previously understood.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of dynamic wetting behavior through curved microchannels with automated image analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09246v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preventing fluid penetration poses a challenging reliability concern in the context of power electronics, which is usually caused by unforeseen microfractures along the sealing joints. A better and more reliable product design heavily depends on the understanding of the dynamic wetting processes happening inside these complex microfractures, i.e. microchannels. A novel automated image processing procedure is proposed in this work for analyzing the moving interface and the dynamic contact angle in microchannels. In particular, the developed method is advantageous for experiments involving non-transparent samples, where extracting the fluid interface geometry poses a significant challenge. The developed method is validated with theoretical values and manual measurements and exhibits high accuracy. The implementation is made publicly available. The developed method is validated and applied to experimental investigations of forced wetting with two working fluids (water and 50 wt% glycerin/water mixture) in four distinct microchannels characterized by different dimensions and curvature. The comparison between the experimental results and molecular kinetic theory (MKT) reveals that the dynamic wetting behavior can be described well by MKT, even in highly curved microchannels. The dynamic wetting behavior shows a strong dependency on the channel geometry and curvature.</description>

Abstract: Lattice Gas Cellular Automata (LGCA) is a classical numerical method widely known and applied to simulate several physical phenomena. Among these phenomena, we find fluid flows described by the Navier-Stokes equations. We develop a quantum algorithm that allows for the simulation of fluid dynamic LGCA on a quantum computer. Furthermore, we prove the conservation of the quantities of interest, but finding more quantum invariants than expected. Finally, we develop a phase estimation procedure for detecting quantities of interest such as mass and momentum, avoiding reinitialization of the cell. In addition, we discuss a sublinear encoding of the lattice which admits a unitary streaming but constrains the collision step.</description>
