      <title>Bulk-edge correspondence in circular-symmetric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a systematic analysis of the eigenfunctions of two-band systems in two dimensions with a circular edge. Our approach is based on an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations.</description>

      <title>Realization of tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in superconducting circuit lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac-like band crossings are paradigms in condensed matter systems to emulate high-energy physics phenomena. They are associated with two aspects: gap and tilting. The ability to design sign-changing gap gives rise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is a gateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. The direction and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering the axially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate three lattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59% of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. This is obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measured microwave resonance frequencies. Harnessing the tilt of Dirac-like band crossings lays the foundation for weaving the fabric of an emergent solid-state spacetime.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cell Characterization via Hydrodynamic Compression in Suspended Microchannel Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microfluidics offer remarkable flexibility for in-flow analyte characterization and can even measure the mechanical properties of biological cells through the application of hydrodynamic forces. In this work, we present a new approach to enhance the performance of nanomechanical resonators featuring integrated microfluidic channels when they are used as cell sensors by means of applying hydrostatic compressions. For this purpose, we have studied analytically how this kind of compressions affects either the mechanical properties of the resonator as well as the analytes. We found that, depending on factors such as device geometry and material composition, the mass limit of detection of the resonator can be reduced while the buoyant mass of the particles is increased when a hydrostatic compression is applied, improving the performance of the sensor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applying these hydrostatic compressions induces shifts in mass distributions among cell lines with similar physical properties, which not only potentially enhances the ability to differentiate between these lines, but also opens the door to measure the cell's compressibility, a biophysical parameter of interest with practical diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>Polymer-based solid-state electrolytes for lithium sulfur batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries offer substantial theoretical energy density gains over Li-ion bat-teries, a crucial factor for transportation electrification. In addition, sulfur is an earth-abundant, inexpensive material obtainable from multiple resources; thus, Li-S batteries are envisioned to provide environmentally sustainable solutions to the growing demand for energy storage. A crit-ical roadblock to the realization of commercial Li-S batteries is the formation of polysulfides and their secondary reactions with liquid organic electrolytes, resulting in low coulombic efficiency for charging and fast self-discharge rates. The realization of solid-state electrolytes for Li-S bat-teries provides potential pathways to address the safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and inhib-it the formation of polysulfides and/or prevent their diffusion into the anode electrode. However, current solid-state electrolytes are limited by low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrode inter-facial compatibility, and restricted electrochemical windows. This review discusses the status of polymer-based electrolytes for Li-S batteries, and outlines current methods for their fabrication, their transport characteristics and ongoing research aimed at overcoming material properties hindering the development of all-solid-state Li-S batteries.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of 3C-SiC from configuration space sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cubic silicon carbide phonon thermal conductivity has been calculated using anharmonic phonon analysis. The atomic interaction model was built using displacement-force data obtained with the High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampling (HECSS) technique and density functional theory calculated forces. In the new version of HECSS we replaced the Markov chain scheme of Metropolis-Hastings Monte-Carlo with weighting of the final sampling according to the target distribution. This increased the efficiency of the method and allowed to use -- with appropriate weight -- all generated and ab-initio evaluated samples. The quality of the proposed method is confirmed by the accuracy with which the experimental results taken from the literature were reproduced.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh interfacial thermal conductance for cooling gallium oxide electronics using cubic boron arsenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga$_2$O$_3$) has attracted significant interest for its unique potential especially in power electronics. However, its low and anisotropic thermal conductivity poses a major challenge for heat dissipation. Here, we explore an effective cooling strategy centering on the heterogeneous integration of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices with cubic boron arsenide (cBAs), an emerging material with an ultrahigh thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of ~1300 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. Machine-learned potentials for representative $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/cBAs interfaces are trained, enabling accurate and efficient calculation of the interfacial thermal conductance $G$ via nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. At 300 K, remarkable $G$ values of 749$\pm$33 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ and 824$\pm$35 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ are predicted for Ga-As and O-B bonding across the interface, respectively, which are primarily attributed to the well-matched phonon density of states considering the similar Debye temperatures of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and cBAs. Moreover, finite-element simulations directly show a notable device temperature reduction when comparing cBAs with other substrates. The simultaneously ultrahigh $\kappa$ and $G$ highlight cBAs as an ideal substrate for Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics.</description>

      <title>Direct ab initio calculation of magnons in altermagnets: method, spin-space symmetry aspects, and application to MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties of these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in the transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.</description>

      <title>Imaging signatures of edge currents in a magnetic topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) host topologically protected edge states, but the role that these edge states play in electronic transport remains unclear. Using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy, we performed local measurements of the current distribution in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at large bias currents, where the quantization of the conductivity tensor breaks down. We find that bulk currents in the channel interior coexist with edge currents at the sample boundary. While the position of the edge current changes with the reversal of the magnetic field, it does not depend on the current direction. To understand our observations, we introduce a model which includes contributions from both the sample magnetization and currents driven by chemical potential gradients. To parameterize our model, we use local measurements of the chemical potential induced changes in the sample magnetization. Our model reveals that the observed edge currents can be understood as changes in the magnetization generated by the electrochemical potential distribution in the sample under bias. Our work underscores the complexity of electronic transport in MTIs and highlights both the value and challenges of using magnetic imaging to disentangle various contributions to the electronic transport signatures.</description>

      <title>Quantum confining excitons with electrostatic moir\'e superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum confining excitons has been a persistent challenge in the pursuit of strong exciton interactions and quantum light generation. Unlike electrons, which can be readily controlled via electric fields, imposing strong nanoscale potentials on excitons to enable quantum confinement has proven challenging. In this study, we utilize piezoresponse force microscopy to image the domain structures of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), revealing evidence of strong in-plane electric fields at the domain boundaries. By placing a monolayer MoSe2 only one to two nanometers away from the twisted hBN interface, we observe energy splitting of neutral excitons and Fermi polarons by several millielectronvolts at the moir\'e domain boundaries. By directly correlating local structural and optical properties, we attribute such observations to excitons confined in a nanoscale one-dimensional electrostatic potential created by the strong in-plane electric fields at the moir\'e domain boundaries. Intriguingly, this 1D quantum confinement results in pronounced polarization anisotropy in the excitons' reflection and emission, persistent to temperatures as high as ~80 Kelvins. These findings open new avenues for exploring and controlling strongly interacting excitons for classical and quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. Exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry sharing facilitates coherent interfaces which can transition from periodic to aperiodic structures. Motivated by the design and construction of such systems, we present hexagonal aperiodic tilings with a single edge-length which can be considered as decorations of a periodic lattice. We introduce these tilings by modifying an existing family of golden-mean trigonal and hexagonal tilings, and discuss their properties in terms of this wider family. Then, we show how the vertices of these new systems can be considered as decorations or sublattice sets of a periodic triangular lattice, before introducing methods to designing coherent aperiodic to periodic interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize the quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth spin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground for exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$ ions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large spin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles calculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing and controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in a cluster spin chain coupled with free spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Exploring Unique Characteristics in Stark Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.</description>
