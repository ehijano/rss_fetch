      <title>Spectral Similarity Masks Structural Diversity at Hydrophobic Water Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The air-water and graphene-water interfaces represent quintessential examples of the liquid-gas and liquid-solid boundaries, respectively. While the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra of these interfaces exhibit certain similarities, a consensus on their signals and interpretations has yet to be reached. Leveraging deep learning, we accessed fully first-principles SFG spectra for both systems, addressing recent experimental discrepancies. Despite both interfaces exhibiting microscopically hydrophobic characteristics, our findings reveal that similarities in SFG signals do not translate into comparable interfacial microscopic properties. Instead, graphene-water and air-water interfaces exhibit fundamental differences in SFG-active thicknesses, hydrogen-bonding networks, and dynamic diffusion behavior. These distinctions underscore the stronger confinements imposed by the solid-liquid interface compared with the weaker constraints of the gas-liquid interface.</description>

      <title>Sparse Reconstruction of Multi-Dimensional Kinetic Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we propose a novel method for reconstruction of multi-dimensional kinetic distributions, based on their representation as a mixture of Dirac delta functions. The representation is found as a solution of an optimization problem. Different target functionals are considered, with a focus on sparsity-promoting regularization terms. The proposed algorithm guarantees non-negativity of the distribution by construction, and avoids an exponential dependence of the computational cost on the dimensionality of the problem.
  Numerical comparisons with other classical methods for reconstruction of kinetic distributions are provided for model problems, and the role of the different parameters governing the optimization problem is studied.</description>

      <title>Infinite Boundary Terms and Pairwise Interactions: A Unified Framework for Periodic Coulomb Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of the infinite boundary terms and the pairwise interactions [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10, 5254, (2014)] enables a physically intuitive approach for deriving electrostatic energy and pressure for both neutral and non-neutral systems under the periodic boundary condition. For a periodic system consisting of $N$ point charges (with charge $q_j$ located at ${\mathbf r}_j$ where $j=1,2,\cdots N$) and one charge distribution of density $\rho({\mathbf r})$ within a primary cell of volume $V$, the derived electrostatic energy can be expressed as, \[ {\mathcal U} = \sum_{i&lt;j}^N q_iq_j\nu({\mathbf r}_{ij} ) + \sum_{j=1}^N q_j \int_V d{\mathbf r}_0\,\rho({\mathbf r}_0) \nu({\mathbf r}_{0j} ) + \frac{1}{2}\int_V d{\mathbf r}_0 \int_V d{\mathbf r}_1\,\rho({\mathbf r}_0)\rho({\mathbf r}_1) \nu({\mathbf r}_{01}), \] where ${\mathbf r}_{ij}={\mathbf r}_i - {\mathbf r}_j$ is the relative vector and $\nu({\mathbf r})$ represents the effective pairwise interaction. The charge density $\rho({\mathbf r})$ is free of Delta-function-like divergence throughout the volume but may exhibit discontinuity. This unified formulation directly follows that of the isolated system by replacing the Coulomb interaction $1/\lvert {\mathbf r} \rvert$ or other modified Coulomb interactions with $\nu({\mathbf r})$. For a particular system of one-component plasma with a uniform neutralizing background, the implementation of various pairwise formulations clarifies the contribution of the background and subsequently reveals criteria for arbitrary volume-dependent potentials that preserve the simple relation between energy and pressure.</description>

      <title>Accurate Ab-initio Neural-network Solutions to Large-Scale Electronic Structure Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present finite-range embeddings (FiRE), a novel wave function ansatz for accurate large-scale ab-initio electronic structure calculations. Compared to contemporary neural-network wave functions, FiRE reduces the asymptotic complexity of neural-network variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) by $\sim n_\text{el}$, the number of electrons. By restricting electron-electron interactions within the neural network, FiRE accelerates all key operations -- sampling, pseudopotentials, and Laplacian computations -- resulting in a real-world $10\times$ acceleration in now-feasible 180-electron calculations. We validate our method's accuracy on various challenging systems, including biochemical compounds, conjugated hydrocarbons, and organometallic compounds. On these systems, FiRE's energies are consistently within chemical accuracy of the most reliable data, including experiments, even in cases where high-accuracy methods such as CCSD(T), AFQMC, or contemporary NN-VMC fall short. With these improvements in both runtime and accuracy, FiRE represents a new `gold-standard' method for fast and accurate large-scale ab-initio calculations, potentially enabling new computational studies in fields like quantum chemistry, solid-state physics, and material design.</description>

      <title>Hydroxide Mobility in Aqueous Systems: Ab Initio Accuracy with Millisecond Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale simulation approach for hydroxide transport in aqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide, combining ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with force field ensemble averaging and lattice Monte Carlo techniques. This method achieves near ab initio accuracy by capturing the femtosecond scale dielectric relaxation dynamics of the aqueous hydrogen bonding network, while extending the simulation capability to millisecond diffusion timescales. This extraordinary extension of the available length and time scales enables future studies of hydroxide mobility in functional materials such as nanostructured anion-exchange membranes, where hydroxide ions migrate through nanometer-sized channels. Remarkably, our approach demonstrates that a single AIMD trajectory is sufficient to predict hydroxide conductivity over a range of concentrations, underscoring its computational efficiency and relevance to the design of advanced energy materials.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking vibrational spectra: 5000 accurate eigenstates of acetonitrile using tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate vibrational spectra are essential for understanding how molecules behave, yet their computation remains challenging and benchmark data to reliable compare different methods are sparse. Here, we present high-accuracy eigenstate computations for the six-atom, 12-dimensional acetonitrile molecule, a prototypical, strongly coupled, anharmonic system. Using a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm with a tree-tensor-network-state (TTNS) ansatz, a refinement using TTNSs as basis set, and reliable procedures to estimate energy errors, we compute up to 5,000 vibrational states with error estimates below 0.0007 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our analysis reveals that previous works underestimated the energy error by up to two orders of magnitude. Our data serve as a benchmark for future vibrational spectroscopy methods and our new method offers a path toward similarly precise computations of large, complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Improving the prediction of spatio-temporal chaos by combining parallel reservoir computing with dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computers can be used to predict time series generated by spatio-temporal chaotic systems. Using multiple reservoirs in parallel has shown improved performances for these predictions, by effectively reducing the input dimensionality of each reservoir. Similarly, one may further reduce the dimensionality of the input data by transforming to a lower-dimensional latent space. Combining both approaches, we show that using dimensionality-reduced latent space predictions for parallel reservoir computing not only reduces computational costs, but also leads to better prediction results for small to medium reservoir sizes. This synergetic approach is illustrated and evaluated on the basis of the prediction of the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Heat Transport via Evanescent Radiation by Hot Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict an additional thermal transport pathway across metal/non-metal interfaces with large electron-phonon non-equilibrium via evanescent radiative heat transfer. In such systems, electron scattering processes vary drastically and can be leveraged to guide heat across interfaces via radiative heat transport without engaging the lattice directly. We employ the formalism of fluctuational electrodynamics to simulate the spectral radiative heat flux across the interface of a metal film and a non-metal substrate. We find that the radiative conductance can exceed 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ at an electron temperature of 5000 K for an emitting tungsten film on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, becoming comparable to its conductive counterpart. This allows for a more holistic approach to the heat flow across interfaces, accounting for electron-phonon non-equilibrium and ultrafast near-field phonon-polariton coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in inverse scattering problems set in layered environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attempt to solve inverse scattering problems often leads to optimization and sampling problems that require handling moderate to large amounts of partial differential equations acting as constraints. We focus here on determining inclusions in a layered medium from the measurement of wave fields on the surface, while quantifying uncertainty and addressing the effect of wave solver quality. Inclusions are characterized by a few parameters describing their material properties and shapes. We devise algorithms to estimate the most likely configurations by optimizing cost functionals with Bayesian regularizations and wave constraints. In particular, we design an automatic Levenberg-Marquardt-Fletcher type scheme based on the use of algorithmic differentiation and adaptive finite element meshes for time dependent wave equation constraints with changing inclusions. In synthetic tests with a single frequency, this scheme converges in few iterations for increasing noise levels. To attain a global view of other possible high probability configurations and asymmetry effects we resort to parallelizable affine invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, at the cost of solving a few million wave problems. This forces the use of prefixed meshes. While the optimal configurations remain similar, we encounter additional high probability inclusions influenced by the prior information, the noise level and the layered structure, effect that can be reduced by considering more frequencies. We analyze the effect on the calculations of working with adaptive and fixed meshes, under a simple choice of non-reflecting boundary conditions in truncated layered domains for which we establish wellposedness and convergence results.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator demonstrates U-ResNet's superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. The model's non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. Statistical analysis of prediction errors reveals that U-ResNet maintains substantially narrower error distributions compared to spectral methods, confirming its reliability for critical hemodynamic assessment. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising tool for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization, with future work focusing on extension to three-dimensional geometries and integration with patient-specific data.</description>

      <title>Elongation-Induced Segregation in Periodically Textured Microfluidic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the motion of elongated microparticles in microfluidic channels at low Reynolds numbers. In channels with smooth walls, asymmetric initial conditions -- including particle orientation and lateral position -- lead to continuous variations in particle trajectories, potentially exhibiting repeated behavior depending on the channel geometry and initial conditions. However, we find that introducing periodically textured walls induces alignment of the particle with the channel centerline within a specific range of texture wavelengths. This occurs as the textured pattern disrupts the uniformity of the flow, creating localized high-velocity nodes that repeatedly guide the particle toward the centerline as it moves downstream. Notably, the characteristic length scale over which this alignment forms reduces with increasing particle elongation and diverges with increasing Reynolds number. Our findings reveal that elongation-induced alignment can be leveraged for microfluidic filtering applications, enabling the efficient separation of microparticles based on their geometric properties. This work opens new avenues for designing microfluidic devices tailored for high-precision particle sorting, with broad implications for biomedical and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Comparative Investigation of MAPbBr$_x$I$_{1-x}$ and SbH$_4$Br$_x$I$_{1-x}$ Perovskites: Electronic and Structural Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper comparatively investigates the structural and electronic properties of hybrid perovskites MAPbBr$_x$I$_{1-x}$ and SbH$_4$PbBr$_x$I$_{1-x}$ by means of DFT-based calculations. The main aim is to check if the increase in band gap due to substitution of I$^-$ ions with Br$^-$ ions can be overcome by introducing the inorganic SbH$_4^+$ cation. Since the Br$^-$ ions merely enhance structural stability of the perovskite framework and SbH$_4^+$ not only sustains that stability but also reduces the band gap to nearly ideal values and thereby improves electronic performance, these are the leading candidates among them. Of them, the reduced band gap SbH$_4$PbI$_3$ ($\sim$1.37 eV) and the perfectly matched SbH$_4$PbBrI$_2$ with its band gap being exactly 1.51 eV are top prospects for being stable and having high-efficiency solar cell applications. The findings show that SbH$_4^+$-based perovskites have potential for future photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>A data-driven convergence booster for accelerating and stabilizing pseudo time-stepping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel data-driven convergence booster that not only accelerates convergence but also stabilizes solutions in cases where obtaining a steady-state solution is otherwise challenging. The method constructs a reduced-order model (ROM) of the solution residual using intermediate solutions and periodically solves a least-square problem in the low-dimensional ROM subspace. The second-order approximation of the residual and the use of normal equation distinguish this work from similar approaches in the literature from the methodology perspective. From the application perspective, in contrast to prior studies that focus on linear systems or idealized problems, we rigorously assess the method's performance on realistic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. In addition to reducing the time complexity of point-iterative solvers for linear systems, we demonstrate substantial reductions in the number of pseudo-time steps required for implicit schemes solving the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations. Across a range of two- and three-dimensional flows-including subsonic inviscid and transonic turbulent cases-the method consistently achieves a 3 to 4 times speedup in wall-clock time. Lastly, the proposed method acts as a robust stabilizer, capable of converging to steady solutions in flows that would otherwise exhibit persistent unsteadiness-such as vortex shedding or transonic buffet-without relying on symmetry boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>REMIX SPH -- improving mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations using a generalised, material-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present REMIX, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme designed to alleviate effects that typically suppress mixing and instability growth at density discontinuities in SPH simulations. We approach this problem by directly targeting sources of kernel smoothing error and discretisation error, resulting in a generalised, material-independent formulation that improves the treatment both of discontinuities within a single material, for example in an ideal gas, and of interfaces between dissimilar materials. This approach also leads to improvements in capturing wider hydrodynamic behaviour unrelated to mixing. We demonstrate marked improvements in three-dimensional test scenarios, focusing on cases with particles of equal mass across the simulation. This choice is particularly relevant for use cases in astrophysics and engineering -- specifically those in which particles are free to evolve over a large range of density scales -- where bespoke choices of unequal particle masses in the initial conditions cannot easily be used to address emergent and evolving density discontinuities. We achieve these improvements while maintaining sharp discontinuities; without introducing additional equation of state dependence in, for example, particle volume elements; and without contrived or targeted corrections. Our methods build upon a fully compressible and thermodynamically consistent core-SPH construction, retaining Galilean invariance as well as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. REMIX is integrated in the open-source, state-of-the-art SWIFT code and is designed with computational efficiency also in mind, meaning that its improved hydrodynamic treatment can be used for high-resolution simulations without prohibitive cost to run-speed.</description>

      <title>A novel discontinuous-Galerkin deterministic neutronics model for Fusion applications: development and benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron interactions in a fusion power plant play a pivotal role in determining critical design parameters such as coil-plasma distance and breeding blanket composition. Fast predictive neutronic capabilities are therefore crucial for an efficient design process. For this purpose, we have developed a new deterministic neutronics method, capable of quickly and quickly assessing the neutron response of a fusion reactor, even in three-dimensional geometry. It uses a novel combination of arbitrary-order discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization, discrete-ordinates angular and multigroup energy discretizations, arbitrary-order anisotropic scattering, and matrix-free iterative solvers, allowing for fast and accurate solutions. One, two, and three-dimensional models are implemented. Cross sections can be obtained from standard databases or from Monte-Carlo simulations. Benchmarks and literature tests were performed, concluding with a successful blanket simulation.</description>

      <title>Numerical limits in the integration of Vlasov-Poisson equation for Cold Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson systems of equations (VP) describes the evolution of a distribution of collisionless particles under the effect of a collective-field potential. VP is at the basis of the study of the gravitational instability of cosmological density perturbations in Dark-Matter (DM), but its range of application extends to other fields, such as plasma physics.
  In the case of Cold Dark Matter, a single velocity is associated with each fluid-element (or particle) , the initial condition presents a stiff discontinuity. This creates problems such as diffusion or negative distribution function when a grid based method is used to solve VP. In this work we want to highlight this problem, focusing on the technical aspects of this phenomenon. By comparing different finite volume methods and a spectral method we observe that, while all integration schemes preserve the invariants of the system (e.g, energy), the physical observable of interest, i.e., the density, is not correctly reproduced. We thus compare the density obtained with the different Eulerian integration schemes with the result obtained from a reference N-body method. We point out that the most suitable method to solve the VP system for a self-gravitating system is a spectral method.</description>

      <title>GPU-based compressible lattice Boltzmann simulations on non-uniform grids using standard C++ parallelism: From best practices to aerodynamics, aeroacoustics and supersonic flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, creating accurate, robust, and efficient lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) on non-uniform grids with seamless GPU acceleration remains challenging. This work introduces a novel strategy to address this challenge by integrating simple yet effective components: (1) parallel algorithms in modern C++, (2) conservative cell-centered grid refinement, (3) local boundary conditions, and (4) robust collision models. Our framework supports multiple lattices (D2Q9, D2Q13, D2Q21, D2Q37) tailored to various flow conditions. It includes collision models with polynomial and numerical equilibria, a second distribution for polyatomic behavior, a Jameson-like shock sensor, and generalizes Rohde's refinement strategy.
  The framework's accuracy and robustness is validated across diverse benchmarks, including lid-driven cavity flows, Aeolian noise, 30P30N airfoil aerodynamics, inviscid Riemann problems, and viscous flows past a NACA airfoil in transonic and supersonic regimes. Modern C++ further enables our framework to reach GPU-native performance, while ensuring high portability, modularity, and ease of implementation. Notably, weakly compressible LBMs achieve state-of-the-art GPU efficiency on non-uniform grids, while fully compressible LBMs benefit from acceleration equivalent to thousands of CPU cores in the most compute-intensive cases. Our advanced performance models incorporate neighbor-list and asynchronous time-stepping effects, providing new insights into the performance decomposition of LB simulations on non-uniform grids.
  Overall, this study sets a new standard for portable, tree-based LBMs, demonstrating that a combination of well-chosen components can achieve high performance, accuracy, and robustness across various flow conditions. As a final proof-of-concept, adaptive mesh refinement is proposed for subsonic and supersonic applications.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) motivated mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods, such as the Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and the Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods, is that these methods are nearly all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips-Kleinman and PAW pseudopotential methods we show that there is an explicit all electron reformulation (which is nearly equivalent). In the all electron reformulation, as part of the basis set, there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions (plane waves) and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment relevant to nuclei of the substances studied. Using this as motivation, here we propose a new, PAW method motivated, basis set for small molecules, where we use the LO or lo (Localized Orbitals) basis wave functions, and pair them with a Gaussian basis, e.g. Gaussian Type Orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). Several different, but related, LO (lo) basis wave functions are considered. We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals, combined with LO or lo orbitals. This is done using shape functions.</description>

      <title>Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing &gt;10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with &gt;10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Negative and positive anisotropic thermal expansion in 2D fullerene networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular C$-$C single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>
