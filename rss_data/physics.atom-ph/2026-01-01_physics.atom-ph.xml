      <title>Investigation of the benefits and disadvantages of using double-pair anti-Helmholtz coils in BEC-producing MOT setups and optimizing their design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work has investigated the Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) system used to produce Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). A primary challenge addressed in this study concerns the geometric limitations of traditional single-pair anti-Helmholtz coil configurations, where the magnetic field peaks occur outside the accessible inter-coil region. To overcome this limitation, we have explored the use of double-pair anti-Helmholtz coil configurations that create well-shaped magnetic field potentials centered at the experimentally accessible $z=0$ location. This investigation encompasses the three sequential processes of atom cooling: cooling in a linear external magnetic field through Doppler cooling, cooling in a well-shaped magnetic field through trapping, and evaporative cooling of atoms to achieve sub-microkelvin temperatures. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, we have determined optimal geometric parameters for the coil configuration and operational parameters including laser detuning, saturation intensity, and initial atom populations for ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ BEC production. The results indicate that with the optimized configuration, the system can achieve final temperatures of approximately $T_f \sim 60\,\mathrm{nK}$ and produce condensate populations of $\sim 10^5$ atoms with a mean density of $n_0 = 4.9 \times 10^{15}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, providing systematic design guidance for experimental BEC systems</description>

      <title>Optical pumping and laser slowing of a heavy molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurements of the electron's electric dipole moment (eEDM) are critical for testing fundamental symmetries in particle physics, and heavy polar molecules-such as barium monofluoride (BaF)-have emerged as promising candidates for advancing the sensitivity. However, the achievement of a 3D magneto-optical trap (MOT) required slowing BaF molecules to near-zero velocity by scattering over 10^4 photons per molecule, demanding a quasi-cycling transition with minimal leakage. We present a detailed study of the leakage channels, including higher vibrational and rotational states. By combining microwave remixing with optical pumping of rotational and vibrational dark states, we reduced the total leakage fraction to 10^-5. Using frequency-chirped laser slowing, we slowed a subset of buffer-gas-cooled BaF molecules from approximately 80 m/s to near-zero velocity, which is critical for efficient MOT loading. This work establishes the technical foundation for precision eEDM measurements using laser-cooled heavy molecules.</description>

      <title>High-flux cold lithium-6 and rubidium-87 atoms from compact two-dimensional magneto-optical traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a compact setup with in-series two-dimensional magneto-optical traps (2D MOTs) that provides high-flux cold lithium and rubidium atoms. Thanks to the efficient short-distance Zeeman slowing, the maximum 3D MOT loading rate of lithium atoms reaches a record value of $6.6\times 10^{9}$ atoms/s at a moderate lithium-oven temperature of 372 degrees Celsius, which is 44 times higher than that without the Zeeman slowing light. The flux of rubidium is also as high as $2.3\times10^9$ atoms/s with the rubidium oven held at room temperature. Meanwhile, the entire vacuum-chamber system, including an ultra-high-vacuum science cell, is within a small volume of $55\times65\times70~\mathrm{cm}^3$. Our work represents a substantial improvement over traditional bulky and complex dual-species cold-atom setups. It provides a good starting point for the fast production of a double-degenerate lithium-rubidium atomic mixture and large samples of ultracold lithium-rubidium ground-state molecules.</description>

      <title>Sub-Ensemble Correlations as a Covariance Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional practice of spatially resolved detection in diffusion-coupled thermal atomic vapors implicitly treat localized responses as mutually independent. However, in this study, it is shown that observable correlations are governed by the intrinsic spatiotemporal covariance of a global spin-fluctuation field, such that spatial separation specifies only overlapping statistical projections rather than independent physical components. A unified field-theoretic description is established in which sub-ensembles are defined as measurement-induced statistical projections of a single stochastic field. Within this formulation, sub-ensemble correlations are determined by the covariance operator, inducing a natural geometry in which statistical independence corresponds to orthogonality of the measurement functionals. For collective spin fluctuations described by a diffusion-relaxation Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic field, the covariance spectrum admits only a finite set of fluctuation modes in a bounded domain, imposing an intrinsic, field-level limit on the number of statistically distinguishable sub-ensembles. The loss of sub-ensemble independence is formalized through the notion of spatial sampling overlap, which quantifies the unavoidable statistical coupling arising from shared access to common low-order fluctuation modes. While multi-channel atomic magnetometry provides a concrete physical setting in which these constraints become explicit, the framework applies generically to diffusion-coupled stochastic fields.</description>

      <title>ExoAtom: A Database of Atomic Spectra in ExoMol Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ExoAtom database, www.exomol.com/exoatom, an extension of the ExoMol database to provide atomic line lists in the ExoMol format. ExoAtom is designed for detailed astrophysical, planetary, and laboratory applications. ExoAtom currently includes atomic data for 80 neutral atoms and 74 singly charged ions. These data are extracted from both the NIST and Kurucz databases, with 79/71 atoms/ions sourced from NIST and 38/37 atoms/ions sourced from Kurucz. ExoAtom uses the file types .all, .def, .states, .trans and .pf as fundamental components for structuring atomic data in a consistent hierarchy. The .states file contains quantum numbers, uncertainties, lifetimes, etc. The .trans file specifies Einstein A coefficients and their associated wavenumbers. The .pf file provides partition functions over a wide grid of temperatures. Post-processing of the ExoAtom data is provided by the program PyExoCross. Future development of ExoAtom will include additional ionization stages.</description>

      <title>Assembling a Bose-Hubbard superfluid from tweezer-controlled single atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing Using Atomic Clocks for Nuclear and Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Technologies for manipulating single atoms have advanced drastically in the past decades. Due to their excellent controllability of internal states, atoms serve as one of the ideal platforms as quantum systems. One major research direction in atomic systems is the precise determination of physical quantities using atoms, which is included in the field of precision measurements. One of such precisely measured physical quantities is energy differences between two energy levels in atoms, which is symbolized by the remarkable fractional uncertainty of $10^{-18}$ or lower achieved in the state-of-the-art atomic clocks. Two-level systems in atoms are sensitive to various external fields and can, therefore, function as quantum sensors. The effect of these fields manifests as energy shifts in the two-level system. Traditionally, such shifts are induced by electric or magnetic fields, as recognized even before the advent of precision spectroscopy with lasers. With high-precision measurements, tiny energy shifts caused by hypothetical fields weakly coupled to ordinary matter or by small effects mediated by massive particles can be potentially detectable, which are conventionally dealt with in the field of nuclear and particle physics. In most cases, the atomic systems as quantum sensors have not been sensitive enough to detect such effects. Instead, experiments searching for these interactions have placed constraints on coupling constants, except in a few cases where effects are predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Nonetheless, measurements and searches for these effects in atomic systems have led to the emergence of a new field of physics.</description>

      <title>A Radio-Frequency Emitter Design for the Low-Frequency Regime in Atomic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. We present a compact and efficient RF circuit based on a capacitive transformer network, where a low-frequency coil operating up to 30MHz serves as both an intrinsic inductor and a power-sharing element. The design enables high current delivery and flexible impedance matching across a wide frequency range. We integrate both broadband and narrowband RF networks into a unified configuration that overcomes the geometric constraints imposed by the metallic chamber. In evaporative cooling, the broadband network allows a reduction of the applied RF input power from 14.7dBW to -3.5dBW, owing to its non-zero coil current even at ultra-low frequencies. This feature enables the Bose-Fermi mixture to be cooled below 10{\mu}K. In a Landau-Zener protocol, the coil driven by the narrowband network transfers 80% of rubidium atoms from |F = 2,mF = 2&gt; to |2,-2&gt; in 1 millisecond, achieving a Rabi frequency of approximately 9 kHz at an input power of 0.1dBW.</description>

      <title>Elimination of angular dependency in quantum three-body problem made easy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a systematic account of elimination of angular dependency from nonrelativistic Schr\"odinger equation for a three-body quantum system with arbitrary masses, charges, angular momentum, and parity. The resulting reduced Schr\"odinger equation (RSE) for the reduced wave components, corresponding to the basis of solid bipolar harmonics, is presented in a compact matrix operator form. The variational form of RSE, providing a practical tool for calculating energy levels and wave functions, is also derived. The resulting angular integrals were derived by expanding bipolar harmonics in a basis of parity-adapted Wigner functions. The theoretical results are numerically validated by computing accurate energy levels for selected states of the helium atom in the explicitly correlated Hylleraas-type basis. The work aims to serve as a self-contained reference for the previously scattered throughout the scientific literature formulation of RSE, offering a convenient foundation for further analytical studies of three-particle quantum systems with arbitrary angular momentum and parity.</description>

      <title>Long-lived giant circular Rydberg atoms at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stability achieved by large angular momentum is ubiquitous in nature, with examples ranging from classical mechanics, over optics and chemistry, to nuclear physics. In atoms, angular momentum can protect excited electronic orbitals from decay due to selection rules. This manifests spectacularly in highly excited Rydberg states. Low angular momentum Rydberg states are at the heart of recent breakthroughs in quantum computing, simulation and sensing with neutral atoms. For these applications the lifetime of the Rydberg levels sets fundamental limits for gate fidelities, coherence times, or spectroscopic precision. The quest for longer Rydberg state lifetimes has motivated the generation, coherent control and trapping of circular Rydberg atoms, which are characterized by the maximally allowed electron orbital momentum and were key to Nobel prize-winning experiments with single atoms and photons. Here, we report the observation of individually trapped circular Rydberg atoms with lifetimes of more than 10 milliseconds, two orders of magnitude longer-lived than the established low angular momentum orbitals. This is achieved via Purcell suppression of blackbody modes at room temperature. We coherently control individual circular Rydberg levels at so far elusive principal quantum numbers of up to $n=103$, and observe tweezer trapping of the Rydberg atoms on the few hundred millisecond scale. Our results pave the way for quantum information processing and sensing utilizing the combination of extreme lifetimes and giant Rydberg blockade.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the parity non-conserving (PNC) electric-dipole ($E1$) transition amplitudes for the $5s - 6s$ and $5s - 4d_{3/2}$ transitions in Rb and Sr$^+$. Our results include both the nuclear-spin-independent and nuclear-spin-dependent contributions, with particular emphasis on the potential effects of a hypothetical additional $Z'$-boson. We highlight possible advantages of using light atoms in searches for such new interaction. The ratio of the contribution of a low mass $Z'$-boson to the contribution of the Standard model $Z$-boson to PNC effects increases rapidly (faster than $1/Z^2$) with decreasing nuclear charge $Z$. Another advantage is that theoretical interpretations of experiments in lighter systems may be carried out with a higher accuracy than that in Cs, Ba$^+$, Fr and Ra$^+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present relativistic many-body perturbation theory plus configuration interaction (MBPT+CI) calculations of the lowest four excited states of Ni$^{12+}$, a promising candidate for highly charged ion (HCI) optical clocks. By combining the convergence behavior from multiple calculation models, we perform a detailed analysis of the electron-correlation effects and both the excitation energies and their uncertainties are obtained. Our computed energies for the first two excited states deviate from experimental values by less than $10~\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, with relative uncertainties estimated below $0.2\%$. Building on the same computational procedure, we calculate the mass shift and field shift constants for the lowest four excited states of Ni$^{12+}$, and the resulting isotope shifts exhibit valence-correlation-induced relative uncertainties below the $1\%$ level. These results provide essential atomic-structure input for high-precision isotope shift spectroscopy in Ni$^{12+}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>
