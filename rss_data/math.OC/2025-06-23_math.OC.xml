      <title>Ahlfors-regularity for minimizers of a multiphase optimal design problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an Alhfors-regularity result for minimizers of a multiphase optimal design problem. It is a variant of the classical variational problem which involves a finite number of chambers $\mathcal{E}(i)$ of prescribed volume that partition a given domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. The cost functional associated with a configuration $\left(\{\mathcal{E}(i)\}_i,u\right)$ is made up of the perimeter of the partition interfaces and a Dirichlet energy term, which is discontinuous across the interfaces. We prove that the union of the optimal interfaces is $(n-1)$-Alhfors-regular via a penalization method and decay estimates of the energy.</description>

      <title>Parallel Polyhedral Projection Method for the Convex Feasibility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the Parallel Polyhedral Projection Method (3PM) and the Approximate Parallel Polyhedral Projection Method (A3PM) for finding a point in the intersection of finitely many closed convex sets. Each iteration has two phases: parallel projections onto the target sets (exact in 3PM, approximate in A3PM), followed by an exact or approximate projection onto a polyhedron defined by supporting half-spaces. These strategies appear novel, as existing methods largely focus on parallel schemes like Cimmino's method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that A3PM often outperforms both classical and recent projection-based methods when the number of sets is greater than two. Theoretically, we establish global convergence for both 3PM and A3PM without regularity assumptions. Under a Slater condition or error bound, we prove linear convergence, even with inexact projections. Additionally, we show that 3PM achieves superlinear convergence under suitable geometric assumptions.</description>

      <title>Tikhonov regularized second-order dynamical systems with Hessian-driven damping for solving convex optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a Tikhonov regularized second-order dynamical system that incorporates time scaling, asymptotically vanishing damping and Hessian-driven damping for solving convex optimization problems. Under appropriate setting of the parameters, we first obtain fast convergence results of the function value along the trajectory generated by the dynamical system. Then, we show that the trajectory generated by the dynamical system converges weakly to a minimizer of the convex optimization problem. We also demonstrate that, by properly tuning these parameters, both the fast convergence rate of the function value and the strong convergence of the trajectory towards the minimum norm solution of the convex optimization problem can be achieved simultaneously. Finally, we present numerical experiments to illustrate the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Infinite horizon discounted LQ optimal control problems for mean-field switching diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an infinite horizon discounted linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control problem for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) incorporating regime switching and mean-field interactions. The regime switching is modeled by a finite-state Markov chain acting as common noise, while the mean-field interactions are characterized by the conditional expectation of the state process given the history of the Markov chain. To address system stability in the infinite horizon setting, a discounted factor is introduced. Within this framework, the well-posedness of the state equation and adjoint equation -- formulated as infinite horizon mean-field forward and backward SDEs with Markov chains, respectively -- is established, along with the asymptotic behavior of their solutions as time approaches infinity. A candidate optimal feedback control law is formally derived based on two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), which are introduced for the first time in this context. The solvability of these AREs is proven through an approximation scheme involving a sequence of Lyapunov equations, and the optimality of the proposed feedback control law is rigorously verified using the completion of squares method. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings, including solutions to the AREs, the optimal control process, and the corresponding optimal (conditional) state trajectory. This work provides a comprehensive framework for solving infinite horizon discounted LQ optimal control problems in the presence of regime switching and mean-field interactions, offering both theoretical insights and practical computational tools.</description>

      <title>Train Unit Scheduling Optimization Considering Unit Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The train unit scheduling problem (TUSP) is an important part of the scheduling process for passenger railway operators. Currently, scholars in various countries have proposed a variety of optimization models based on specific local railway situations and scheduling needs. This research investigates the train unit scheduling problem in the UK. We propose an Enhanced Train Unit Scheduling Problem with Unit Ordering based on existing integer multicommodity flow models. We innovatively introduce unit ordering variables representing the order in which train units are coupled for serving the same trip as well as train direction parameters so that our model can provide unit order information and avoid unit blockage in stations. We present experimental results based on three different sizes of artificial data, as well as real-world data based on the Trans Pennine Express' Anglo-Scottish route. The experimental results showed that our model is able to provide the ordering information corresponding to each train unit and prevents the blockage in the station.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider output tracking and disturbance rejection for abstract infinite-dimensional systems with input saturation. We solve the control problem using a control law which consists of a stabilising error feedback term and a feedforward term based on the reference and disturbance signals. We use our results to design control laws for output tracking and disturbance rejection for a two-dimensional heat equation and a one-dimensional wave equation with boundary control and observation.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence Rates of Iterative Regularization Algorithms for Composite Bi-Level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates iterative methods for solving bi-level optimization problems where both inner and outer functions have a composite structure. We provide novel theoretical results, including the first convergence rate analysis for the Iteratively REgularized Proximal Gradient (IRE-PG) method, a variant of Solodov's algorithm. Our results establish simultaneous convergence rates for the inner and outer functions, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between their respective convergence rates. We further extend this analysis to an accelerated version of IRE-PG, proving faster convergence rates under specific settings. Additionally, we propose a new scheme for handling cases where these methods cannot be directly applied to the bi-level problem due to the difficulty of computing the associated proximal operator. This scheme offers surrogate functions to approximate the original problem and a framework to translate convergence rates between the surrogate and original functions. Our results show that the accelerated method's advantage diminishes under this translation.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Strategic Plan for Transition to Campus-Scale Clean Electricity Using Multi-Stage Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to clean energy systems at large-scale campuses is a critical step toward achieving global decarbonization goals. However, this transition poses significant challenges, including substantial capital requirements, technological uncertainties, and the operational complexities of integrating renewable energy technologies. This study presents a dynamic strategic planning framework for campus-scale clean electricity transitions, utilizing a multi-stage stochastic programming model that jointly optimizes technology deployment, storage operations, and grid interactions. The model enables adaptive decision-making by incorporating uncertainties in technological cost trajectories and efficiency improvements, providing a tool for large-scale electricity consumers aiming to achieve clean and self-sufficient electricity systems. The framework is applied to a case study of Middle East Technical University, which has committed to achieving carbon-neutral electricity by 2040. By integrating solar photovoltaic, wind, and lithium-ion battery technologies, the model generates annual investment and operational strategies aligned with high-resolution temporal demand and generation profiles. The results demonstrate that uncertainty-aware, temporally detailed planning can significantly enhance the economic viability and operational feasibility of campus-scale clean energy transitions.</description>

      <title>Online Feedback Optimization for Monotone Systems without Timescale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) steers a dynamical plant to a cost-efficient steady-state, only relying on input-output sensitivity information, rather than on a full plant model. Unlike traditional feedforward approaches, OFO leverages real-time measurements from the plant, thereby inheriting the robustness and adaptability of feedback control. Unfortunately, existing theoretical guarantees for OFO assumes that the controller operates on a slower timescale than the plant, which can affect responsiveness and transient performance. In this paper, we focus on relaxing this ``timescale separation'' assumption. Specifically, we consider the class of monotone systems, and we prove that OFO can achieve an optimal operating point, regardless of the time constants of controller and plant. By leveraging a small gain theorem for monotone systems, we derive several sufficient conditions for global convergence. Notably, these conditions depend only on the steady-state behavior of the plant, and they are entirely independent of the transient dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a special class of nonconvex semidefinite programming problems and show that every point satisfying the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions is globally optimal despite nonconvexity. This property is related to pseudoconvex optimization. This class of problems is motivated by an eigenfrequency topology optimization problem in structural engineering, but is presented in a more general form.</description>

      <title>General Linear-Quadratic Mean Field Stochastic Differential Game with Common Noise: a Direct Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of general linear-quadratic mean field games with common noise, where the diffusion terms of the system contain the state variables, control variables, and the average state terms. We solve the problem using both the direct method and the fixed-point method in the paper. First, by using the variational method to solve a finite $N$-players game problem, we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the centralized open-loop Nash equilibrium strategy. Subsequently, by employing the decoupling technique, we derive the state feedback representation of the centralized open-loop Nash equilibrium strategy in terms of Riccati equations. Next, by studying the asymptotic solvability of the Riccati equations, we construct the decentralized open-loop asymptotic Nash equilibrium strategies. Finally, through some estimates, we prove the asymptotic optimality of the decentralized open-loop Nash equilibrium strategies. Moreover, we find that the decentralized open-loop asymptotic Nash equilibrium strategies obtained via the fixed-point method are identical to those derived using the direct method.</description>

      <title>Non-linear estimators for the observation and stabilisation of falling liquid films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Falling liquid films are complex physical processes modelled by infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. The interfacial behaviour is characterised by the Reynolds number, a nondimensional parameter, and above a critical value the uniform film becomes unstable and travelling waves occur. By injecting and removing fluid from the base at discrete locations, we aim to stabilise otherwise unstable flat interfaces, with the additional limitation that observations of the state are restricted to finitely many measurements of the film height. Successful feedback control has recently been achieved in the case of full observations using linear-quadratic regulator controls coupled to asymptotic approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations, but restricted observations severely curtailed their performance. In this study we couple the well understood full-information feedback control strategy to a non-linear estimator. The dynamics of the estimator are designed to approximate those of the film, and we apply a forcing term chosen to ensure that measurements of the estimator match the available measurements of the film. Using this method, we restore the performance of the controls to a level approaching their full information counterparts, even at moderately large Reynolds numbers. We also briefly investigate the effects of the relative positioning of actuators and observers on the resulting dynamics.</description>

      <title>Worst-case convergence analysis of relatively inexact gradient descent on smooth convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical gradient descent algorithm with constant stepsizes, where some error is introduced in the computation of each gradient. More specifically, we assume some relative bound on the inexactness, in the sense that the norm of the difference between the true gradient and its approximate value is bounded by a certain fraction of the gradient norm. This paper presents a worst-case convergence analysis of this so-called relatively inexact gradient descent on smooth convex functions, using the Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) framework. We first derive the exact worst-case behavior of the method after one step. Then we study the case of several steps and provide computable upper and lower bounds using the PEP framework. Finally, we discuss the optimal choice of constant stepsize according to the obtained worst-case convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Modeling society with a responsible elite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the ViSE (Voting in a Stochastic Environment) model, we examine the dynamics in a society, part of which can be considered an elite. The model allows us to analyze the influence of social attitudes, such as collectivism, individualism, altruism on the well-being of agents. The dynamics is determined by collective decisions and changes in the structure of society, in particular, by the formation of groups of cooperating agents. It is found that the presence of a "responsible elite", combining the support of other agents with limited concern for their own benefit, stabilizes society and eliminates the "pit of losses" paradox. The benefit to society from having a responsible elite is comparable to that from having a prosocial group of the same size. If the elite radically increases the weight of the group component in its combined voting strategy, then its incomes rise sharply, while society's incomes decline. If, in response to the selfish transformation of the elite, a new responsible elite emerges, proportionally larger than the previous one, then society will stabilize again, and the old elite will lose its dominant position. This process can be repeated as long as the size of society allows the formation of new responsible elites of the required size.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Factorization Approach for High-Order Structured Tensor Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.
  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold. Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably, both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker and tensor-train format tensors.</description>

      <title>Solving Zero-Sum Convex Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We contribute the first provable guarantees of global convergence to Nash equilibria (NE) in two-player zero-sum convex Markov games (cMGs) by using independent policy gradient methods. Convex Markov games, recently defined by Gemp et al. (2024), extend Markov decision processes to multi-agent settings with preferences that are convex over occupancy measures, offering a broad framework for modeling generic strategic interactions. However, even the fundamental min-max case of cMGs presents significant challenges, including inherent nonconvexity, the absence of Bellman consistency, and the complexity of the infinite horizon.
  We follow a two-step approach. First, leveraging properties of hidden-convex--hidden-concave functions, we show that a simple nonconvex regularization transforms the min-max optimization problem into a nonconvex-proximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz (NC-pPL) objective. Crucially, this regularization can stabilize the iterates of independent policy gradient methods and ultimately lead them to converge to equilibria. Second, building on this reduction, we address the general constrained min-max problems under NC-pPL and two-sided pPL conditions, providing the first global convergence guarantees for stochastic nested and alternating gradient descent-ascent methods, which we believe may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Optimal Online Bookmaking for Any Number of Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Online Bookmaking problem, where a bookmaker dynamically updates betting odds on the possible outcomes of an event. In each betting round, the bookmaker can adjust the odds based on the cumulative betting behavior of gamblers, aiming to maximize profit while mitigating potential loss. We show that for any event and any number of betting rounds, in a worst-case setting over all possible gamblers and outcome realizations, the bookmaker's optimal loss is the largest root of a simple polynomial. Our solution shows that bookmakers can be as fair as desired while avoiding financial risk, and the explicit characterization reveals an intriguing relation between the bookmaker's regret and Hermite polynomials. We develop an efficient algorithm that computes the optimal bookmaking strategy: when facing an optimal gambler, the algorithm achieves the optimal loss, and in rounds where the gambler is suboptimal, it reduces the achieved loss to the optimal opportunistic loss, a notion that is related to subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The key technical contribution to achieve these results is an explicit characterization of the Bellman-Pareto frontier, which unifies the dynamic programming updates for Bellman's value function with the multi-criteria optimization framework of the Pareto frontier in the context of vector repeated games.</description>

Abstract: We investigate linear operators $A:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. We give explicit operators $A$ such that, for fixed $d\in\mathbb{N}_0$ and closed $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(K)_{\leq 2d}\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]_{\leq d}^2$. We give an explicit operator $A$ such that $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(\mathbb{R}^n)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. For $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, we give a condition such that $A$ exists with $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. In the framework of regular Fr\'echet Lie groups and Lie algebras we investigate the linear operators $A$ such that $e^{tA}:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is well-defined for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$. We give a three-line-proof of Stochel's Theorem.</description>

      <title>A Minimalist Optimizer Design for LLM Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1) column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights, we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition, our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer design.</description>

      <title>Soft decision trees for survival analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15 well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended to consider group fairness.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Zernike-Lyapunov Framework for Aberration-Based Statistical Wavefront Reconstruction of Chaotic Optical Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that unifies chaotic wavefront dynamics with classical aberration theory through a Statistical Wavefront Reconstruction Framework (SWRF) formalism. By establishing rigorous connections between ray trajectory deflections and wave-optical phase perturbations through the eikonal equation, we decompose chaotic wavefront perturbations into modified Zernike-Lyapunov hybrid expansions, establishing mathematical equivalences between Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimensions, and traditional aberration coefficients. This chaotic aberration theory enables systematic incorporation of non-integrable wavefront dynamics into deterministic design frameworks, providing a rigorous foundation for controlled chaos in optical systems. We derive analytical relationships connecting surface chaos parameters to optical performance metrics, demonstrate the framework's validity through phase space analysis, and establish convergence criteria for the chaotic expansion. The theory reveals how chaotic surface geometries can be intentionally designed to achieve specific optical functionalities, including beam homogenization, speckle reduction, and novel wavefront shaping capabilities, while maintaining mathematical rigor comparable to classical aberration analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimal Depth of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the optimal depth of a neural network is a fundamental yet challenging problem, typically resolved through resource-intensive experimentation. This paper introduces a formal theoretical framework to address this question by recasting the forward pass of a deep network, specifically a Residual Network (ResNet), as an optimal stopping problem. We model the layer-by-layer evolution of hidden representations as a sequential decision process where, at each layer, a choice is made between halting computation to make a prediction or continuing to a deeper layer for a potentially more refined representation. This formulation captures the intrinsic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Our primary theoretical contribution is a proof that, under a plausible condition of diminishing returns on the residual functions, the expected optimal stopping depth is provably finite, even in an infinite-horizon setting. We leverage this insight to propose a novel and practical regularization term, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm depth}$, that encourages the network to learn representations amenable to efficient, early exiting. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by extending it to the Transformer architecture and exploring its connection to continuous-depth models via free-boundary problems. Empirical validation on ImageNet confirms that our regularizer successfully induces the theoretically predicted behavior, leading to significant gains in computational efficiency without compromising, and in some cases improving, final model accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the analytic adjoint solution of the two-dimensional (2D) full potential equation for subcritical flows for a cost function measuring aerodynamic force by the Green's function approach and by the connection of the adjoint full potential and compressible Euler equations. The solution for aerodynamic lift is written in terms of two unknown functions encoding the effect of perturbations to the Kutta condition. We analyze the properties of these functions from an analytic viewpoint and also by examining numerical adjoint solutions. We also discuss a possible formulation of the Kutta condition within the adjoint framework</description>

      <title>Moment Constrained Optimal Transport for Control Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the application of techniques from optimal transport (OT) to mean field control, in which the probability measures of interest in OT correspond to empirical distributions associated with a large collection of controlled agents. The control objective of interest motivates a one-sided relaxation of OT, in which the first marginal is fixed and the second marginal is constrained to a moment class: a set of probability measures defined by generalized moment constraints. This relaxation is particularly interesting for control problems as it enables the coordination of agents without the need to know the desired distribution beforehand. The inclusion of an entropic regularizer is motivated by both computational considerations, and also to impose hard constraints on agent behavior. A computational approach inspired by the Sinkhorn algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. This new approach to distributed control is illustrated with an application of charging a fleet of electric vehicles while satisfying grid constraints. An online version is proposed and applied in a case study on the ElaadNL dataset containing 10,000 EV charging transactions in the Netherlands. This empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach to optimizing flexibility while respecting grid constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents GeNI-ADMM, a framework for large-scale composite convex optimization that facilitates theoretical analysis of both existing and new approximate ADMM schemes. GeNI-ADMM encompasses any ADMM algorithm that solves a first- or second-order approximation to the ADMM subproblem inexactly. GeNI-ADMM exhibits the usual $\mathcal{O} (1/t)$-convergence rate under standard hypotheses and converges linearly under additional hypotheses such as strong convexity. Further, the GeNI-ADMM framework provides explicit convergence rates for ADMM variants accelerated with randomized linear algebra, such as NysADMM and sketch-and-solve ADMM, resolving an important open question on the convergence of these methods. This analysis quantifies the benefit of improved approximations and can aid in the design of new ADMM variants with faster convergence.</description>

      <title>A BSDE approach to the asymmetric risk-sensitive optimization and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09430v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to proposing a new asymmetric risk-sensitive criterion involving different risk attitudes toward varying risk sources. The criterion can only be defined through the initial value of the minimal solutions of quadratic backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). Before uncovering the mean-variance representation for the introduced criterion by the variational approach, some axioms are given for the first time to characterize a variance decomposition of square integrable random variables. The stochastic control problems under this criterion are described as a kind of stochastic recursive control problems that includes controlled quadratic BSDEs. An asymmetric risk-sensitive global stochastic maximum principle is derived when the quadratic BSDEs are equipped with bounded data. A closed-form solution of a stochastic linear-quadratic risk-sensitive control problem is obtained by introducing a novel completion-of-squares technique for controlled quadratic BSDEs. In addition, a dynamic portfolio optimization problem featuring a stochastic return rate is provided as an application of the asymmetric risk-sensitive control.</description>

      <title>Solving equilibrium problems in economies with financial markets, home production, and retention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new methodology to compute equilibria for general equilibrium problems on exchange economies with real financial markets, home-production, and retention. We demonstrate that equilibrium prices can be determined by solving a related maxinf-optimization problem. We incorporate the non-arbitrage condition for financial markets into the equilibrium formulation and establish the equivalence between solutions to both problems. This reduces the complexity of the original by eliminating the need to directly compute financial contract prices, allowing us to calculate equilibria even in cases of incomplete financial markets.
  We also introduce a Walrasian bifunction that captures the imbalances and show that maxinf-points of this function correspond to equilibrium points. Moreover, we demonstrate that every equilibrium point can be approximated by a limit of maxinf points for a family of perturbed problems, by relying on the notion of lopsided convergence.
  Finally, we propose an augmented Walrasian algorithm and present numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. Our methodology allows for efficient calculation of equilibria in a variety of exchange economies and has potential applications in finance and economics.</description>

      <title>On the true detection probability of the uniformly optimal search plan</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18226v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gold standard for designing a search plan is to select a target distribution and then find the uniformly optimal search plan based on it. This approach has been successfully applied in several high-profile civil and military search missions. Since the target distribution is subjective and chosen at an analyst's discretion, it is natural to ask whether this approach can generate a search plan that maximizes the true detection probability at each moment. This article gives a negative answer by establishing that, under mild conditions, for a given target distribution and the uniformly optimal search plan based on it, there is another target distribution whose induced uniformly optimal search plan leads to an increased true detection probability at every moment. In particular, it implies that the problem of finding a search plan that maximizes the true detection probability at each moment remains unsolved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the null controllability for parabolic SPDEs involving both the state and the gradient of the state. To start with, an improved global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with general random coefficients and square-integrable source terms is derived. Based on this, we further develop a new global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with source terms in the Sobolev space of negative order, which enables us to deal with the global null controllability for linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs with gradient terms. As a byproduct, a special weighted energy-type estimate for the controlled system that explicitly depends on the parameters $\lambda,\mu$ and the weighted function $\theta$ is obtained, which makes it possible to extend the linear null controllability to semi-linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs by applying the fixed-point argument in an appropriate Banach space.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this work is to develop a deep learning method for solving high-dimensional stochastic control problems based on the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation and physics-informed learning. Our approach is to parameterize the feedback control and the value function using a decoupled neural network with multiple outputs. We train this network by using a loss function with penalty terms that enforce the HJB equation along the sampled trajectories generated by the controlled system. More significantly, numerical results on various applications are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient and applicable.</description>

      <title>Particle Filter Optimization: A Bayesian Approach for Global Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel global optimization algorithm, Particle Filter-Based Optimization (PFO), designed for a class of stochastic optimization problems in which the objective function lacks an analytical form and is subject to noisy evaluations. PFO utilizes the Bayesian inference framework of Particle Filters (PF) by reformulating the optimization task as a state estimation problem. In this context, evaluations of the objective function are interpreted as measurements, and a customized transition model based on covariance ellipsoids is introduced to guide particle propagation. This model serves as a surrogate for classical acquisition functions, equipping the PF framework with local search capabilities and supporting efficient exploration of the global optimum. To mitigate the adverse effects of measurement noise, the Unscented Transform (UT) is employed to approximate the underlying mean of the objective function, enhancing the accuracy of particle updates. The algorithm offers notable improvements over existing stochastic optimization algorithms for black-box multi-modal objective functions. First, PFO provides a fully probabilistic definition of particle weights, enhancing adaptability and robustness. Second, PFO integrates exploration and exploitation within a unified Bayesian framework, ensuring a non-zero probability of sampling from unexplored regions throughout the optimization process. This approach contrasts with traditional particle filter methods that are primarily used for state estimation, and heuristic optimization algorithms that lack theoretical guarantees. The novelty of PFO lies in its unique integration of particle filtering with a dynamic search space prediction, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to acquisition functions in Bayesian Optimization (BO).</description>

      <title>A multiscale Consensus-Based algorithm for multi-level optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel multiscale consensus-based optimization (CBO) algorithm for solving bi- and tri-level optimization problems is introduced. Existing CBO techniques are generalized by the proposed method through the employment of multiple interacting populations of particles, each of which is used to optimize one level of the problem. These particle populations are evolved through multiscale-in-time dynamics, which are formulated as a singularly perturbed system of stochastic differential equations. Theoretical convergence analysis for the multiscale CBO model to an averaged effective dynamics as the time-scale separation parameter approaches zero is provided. The resulting algorithm is presented for both bi-level and tri-level optimization problems. The effectiveness of the approach in tackling complex multi-level optimization tasks is demonstrated through numerical experiments on various benchmark functions. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed method performs well on min-max optimization problems, comparing favorably with existing CBO algorithms for saddle point problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Optimal Control of State-Triggered Affine Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of the dynamics and control for linear and affine hybrid systems subjected to either temporally- or spatially-triggered resets is presented. Hybrid trajectories are capable of degeneracies not found in continuous-time systems namely beating, blocking, and Zeno. These pathologies are commonly avoided by enforcing a lower bound on the time between events. While this constraint is straightforward to implement for temporally-triggered resets, it is impossible to do so for spatially-triggered systems. In particular, linear spatially-triggered hybrid systems always posses trajectories that are beating and blocking while affine systems may also include Zeno trajectories. The hybrid Pontryagin maximum principle is studied in the context of affine hybrid systems. The existence/uniqueness of the induced co-state jump conditions is studied which introduces the notion of strongly and weakly actuated resets. Finally, optimal control in the context of beating and Zeno is discussed. This work concludes with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Faster Stochastic Optimization with Arbitrary Delays via Asynchronous Mini-Batching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of asynchronous stochastic optimization, where an optimization algorithm makes updates based on stale stochastic gradients of the objective that are subject to an arbitrary (possibly adversarial) sequence of delays. We present a procedure which, for any given $q \in (0,1]$, transforms any standard stochastic first-order method to an asynchronous method with convergence guarantee depending on the $q$-quantile delay of the sequence. This approach leads to convergence rates of the form $O(\tau_q/qT+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for non-convex and $O(\tau_q^2/(q T)^2+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for convex smooth problems, where $\tau_q$ is the $q$-quantile delay, generalizing and improving on existing results that depend on the average delay. We further show a method that automatically adapts to all quantiles simultaneously, without any prior knowledge of the delays, achieving convergence rates of the form $O(\inf_{q} \tau_q/qT+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for non-convex and $O(\inf_{q} \tau_q^2/(q T)^2+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for convex smooth problems. Our technique is based on asynchronous mini-batching with a careful batch-size selection and filtering of stale gradients.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Interaction Dynamics with Dual Model Predictive Control for Multi-Agent Systems Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of a single agent in complex and uncertain multi-agent environments requires careful consideration of the interactions between the agents. In this context, this paper proposes a dual model predictive control (MPC) method using Gaussian process (GP) models for multi-agent systems. While Gaussian process MPC (GP-MPC) has been shown to be effective in predicting the dynamics of other agents, current methods do not consider the influence of the control input on the covariance of the predictions, and hence lack the dual control effect. Therefore, we propose a dual MPC that directly optimizes the actions of the ego agent, and the belief of the other agents by jointly optimizing their state trajectories as well as the associated covariance while considering their interactions through a GP. We demonstrate our GP-MPC method in a simulation study on autonomous driving, showing improved prediction quality compared to a baseline stochastic MPC. The results show that GP-MPC can learn the interactions between the agents online, demonstrating the potential of GPs for dual MPC in uncertain and unseen scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper extends the widely used in optimisation theory decoupling techniques to infinite collections of functions. Extended concepts of uniform lower semicontinuity and firm uniform lower semicontinuity are discussed. The main theorems give fuzzy subdifferential necessary conditions (multiplier rules) for a local minimum of the sum of an infinite collection of functions and fuzzy subdifferential sum rules without the traditional Lipschitz continuity assumptions. More subtle "quasi" versions of the uniform infimum and uniform lower semicontinuity properties are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We frame dynamic persuasion in a partial observation stochastic control Leader-Follower game with an ergodic criterion. The Receiver controls the dynamics of a multidimensional unobserved state process. Information is provided to the Receiver through a device designed by the Sender that generates the observation process. The commitment of the Sender is enforced. We develop this approach in the case where all dynamics are linear and the preferences of the Receiver are linear-quadratic. We prove a verification theorem for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the HJB equation satisfied by the Receiver's value function. An extension to the case of persuasion of a mean field of interacting Receivers is also provided. We illustrate this approach in two applications: the provision of information to electricity consumers with a smart meter designed by an electricity producer; the information provided by carbon footprint accounting rules to companies engaged in a best-in-class emissions reduction effort. In the first application, we link the benefits of information provision to the mispricing of electricity production. In the latter, we show that information provision is a substitute for best-in-class objective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we deal with the problem of computing a comprehensive front of efficient solutions in multi-objective portfolio optimization problems in presence of sparsity constraints. We start the discussion pointing out some weaknesses of the classical linear scalarization approach when applied to the considered class of problems. We are then motivated to propose a suitable algorithmic framework that is designed to overcome these limitations: the novel algorithm combines a gradient-based exploration-refinement strategy with a tailored initialization scheme based on memetic or multi-start descent procedures. Thorough computational experiments highlight how the proposed method is far superior to both linear scalarization and popular genetic algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17012v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model of infinite horizon linear dynamic optimization and obtain results concerning existence of solution and satisfaction of the competitive condition and transversality condition being unconditionally sufficient for optimality of a trajectory. We also show that under some mild restrictions the optimal trajectory satisfies the Euler condition and a related transversality condition. The optimal trajectory satisfies the functional equation of dynamic programming. Under an additional convexity assumption for the two-period constraint sets, we show that the optimal value function is concave and continuous. Linearity bites when it comes to the definition of optimal decision rules which can no longer be guaranteed to be single-valued. We show that if all the two-period constraint sets are convex, then the optimal decision rule is an upper semi-continuous correspondence. For linear cake-eating problems, we obtain monotonicity results for the optimal value function and a conditional monotonicity result for optimal decision rules. We also introduce the concept of a two-phase linear cake eating problem and obtain a necessary condition that must be satisfied by all solutions of such problems. We show that for a class of linear dynamic optimization problems, known as interlinked linear dynamic optimization problems, a slightly modified version of the functional equation of dynamic programming is satisfied.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new intermediate optimization problem situated between Kantorovich's primal and dual formulations. This new problem extends Kantorovich's duality to separable Baire measures, which are strictly more general than tight (or Radon) measures in completely regular Hausdorff spaces. In the special case where the measures are Radon, our intermediate problem aligns with the classical Kantorovich's primal problem. Existence of solutions for all three formulations are also provided within this comprehensive framework.</description>

      <title>Integral Form of Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto Collocation for Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method is described for solving optimal control problems using direct collocation at Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto points. The approach of this paper employs a polynomial approximation of the right-hand side vector field of the differential equations and leads to the following important outcomes. First, the first-order optimality conditions of the LGL integral form are derived, which lead to a full-rank transformed adjoint system and novel costate estimate. Next, a derivative-like form of the LGL collocation method is obtained by multiplying the system by the inverse of an appropriate full-rank block of the integration matrix. The first-order optimality conditions of the LGL derivative-like form are then derived, leading to an equivalent full-rank transformed adjoint system and secondary novel costate estimate which is related to the costate estimate of the integral form via a linear transformation. Then, it is shown that a second integral form can be constructed by including an additional noncollocated support point, but such a point is superfluous and has no impact on the solution to the nonlinear programming problem. Finally, the method is demonstrated on two benchmark problems: a one-dimensional initial value optimal control problem with an analytic solution and a time-variant orbit raising optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Worst-Case Services and State-Based Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06062v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we shed new light on a classical scheduling problem: given a slot-timed, constant-capacity server, what short-run scheduling decisions must be made to provide long-run service guarantees to competing flows of unit-sized tasks? We model each flow's long-run guarantee as a worst-case service that maps each queued arrival vector recording the flow's cumulative task arrivals, including those initially queued, to a worst-case acceptable departure vector lower-bounding its cumulative served tasks. We show that these maps are states that can be updated as tasks arrive and are served, introduce state-based scheduling, find the schedulability condition necessary and sufficient to maintain all flows' long-run guarantees, and use this condition to identify all short-run scheduling decisions that preserve schedulability. Our framework is general but computationally complex. To reduce complexity, we consider three specializations. First, we show that when satisfactory short-run scheduling decisions exist, at least one can be efficiently identified by maximizing the server's capacity slack, a generalization of the earliest-deadline-first rule. Second, we show that a special class of worst-case services, min-plus services, can be efficiently specified and updated using properties of the min-plus algebra. Finally, we show that efficiency can be further improved by restricting attention to a min-plus service subclass, dual-curve services. This last specialization turns out to be a dynamic extension of service curves that maintains all essential features of our framework while approaching near practical viability.</description>

      <title>EF21 with Bells &amp; Whistles: Six Algorithmic Extensions of Modern Error Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.03294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First proposed by Seide (2014) as a heuristic, error feedback (EF) is a very popular mechanism for enforcing convergence of distributed gradient-based optimization methods enhanced with communication compression strategies based on the application of contractive compression operators. However, existing theory of EF relies on very strong assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients), and provides pessimistic convergence rates (e.g., while the best known rate for EF in the smooth nonconvex regime, and when full gradients are compressed, is $O(1/T^{2/3})$, the rate of gradient descent in the same regime is $O(1/T)$). Recently, Richt\'arik et al. (2021) proposed a new error feedback mechanism, EF21, based on the construction of a Markov compressor induced by a contractive compressor. EF21 removes the aforementioned theoretical deficiencies of EF and at the same time works better in practice. In this work we propose six practical extensions of EF21, all supported by strong convergence theory: partial participation, stochastic approximation, variance reduction, proximal setting, momentum, and bidirectional compression. To the best of our knowledge, several of these techniques have not been previously analyzed in combination with EF, and in cases where prior analysis exists -- such as for bidirectional compression -- our theoretical convergence guarantees significantly improve upon existing results.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Decision-Focused Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16487v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) is an emerging learning paradigm that tackles the task of training a machine learning (ML) model to predict missing parameters of an incomplete optimization problem, where the missing parameters are predicted. DFL trains an ML model in an end-to-end system, by integrating the prediction and optimization tasks, providing better alignment of the training and testing objectives. DFL has shown a lot of promise and holds the capacity to revolutionize decision-making in many real-world applications. However, very little is known about the performance of these models under adversarial attacks. We adopt ten unique DFL methods and benchmark their performance under two distinctly focused attacks adapted towards the Predict-then-Optimize problem setting. Our study proposes the hypothesis that the robustness of a model is highly correlated with its ability to find predictions that lead to optimal decisions without deviating from the ground-truth label. Furthermore, we provide insight into how to target the models that violate this condition and show how these models respond differently depending on the achieved optimality at the end of their training cycles.</description>

      <title>Safe Guaranteed Exploration for Non-linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safely exploring environments with a-priori unknown constraints is a fundamental challenge that restricts the autonomy of robots. While safety is paramount, guarantees on sufficient exploration are also crucial for ensuring autonomous task completion. To address these challenges, we propose a novel safe guaranteed exploration framework using optimal control, which achieves first-of-its-kind results: guaranteed exploration for non-linear systems with finite time sample complexity bounds, while being provably safe with arbitrarily high probability. The framework is general and applicable to many real-world scenarios with complex non-linear dynamics and unknown domains. We improve the efficiency of this general framework by proposing an algorithm, SageMPC, SAfe Guaranteed Exploration using Model Predictive Control. SageMPC leverages three key techniques: i) exploiting a Lipschitz bound, ii) goal-directed exploration, and iii) receding horizon style re-planning, all while maintaining the desired sample complexity, safety and exploration guarantees of the framework. Lastly, we demonstrate safe efficient exploration in challenging unknown environments using SageMPC with a car model.</description>

Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) provides a value function that encodes the set of states from which a system with bounded control inputs can reach or avoid a target despite any bounded disturbance, and the corresponding robust, optimal control policy. Though powerful, traditional methods for HJR rely on dynamic programming (DP) and suffer from exponential computation growth with respect to state dimension. The recently favored Hopf formula mitigates this ``curse of dimensionality'' by providing an efficient and space-parallelizable approach for solving the reachability problem. However, the Hopf formula can only be applied to linear time-varying systems. To overcome this limitation, we show that the error between a nonlinear system and a linear model can be transformed into an adversarial bounded artificial disturbance. One may then solve the dimension-robust generalized Hopf formula for a linear game with this ``antagonistic error" to perform guaranteed conservative reachability analysis and control synthesis of nonlinear systems; this can be done for problem formulations in which no other HJR method is both computationally feasible and guaranteed. In addition, we offer several technical methods for reducing conservativeness in the analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our results through one illustrative example (the controlled Van der Pol system) that can be compared to standard DP, and one higher-dimensional 15D example (a 5-agent pursuit-evasion game with Dubins cars).</description>

      <title>State-Augmented Linear Games with Antagonistic Error for High-Dimensional, Nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) is a popular method for analyzing the liveness and safety of a dynamical system with bounded control and disturbance. The corresponding HJ value function offers a robust controller and characterizes the reachable sets, but is traditionally solved with Dynamic Programming (DP) and limited to systems of dimension less than six. Recently, the space-parallelizeable, generalized Hopf formula has been shown to also solve the HJ value with a nearly three-log increase in dimension limit, but is limited to linear systems. To extend this potential, we demonstrate how state-augmented (SA) spaces, which are well-known for their improved linearization accuracy, may be used to solve tighter, conservative approximations of the value function with any linear model in this SA space. Namely, we show that with a representation of the true dynamics in the SA space, a series of inequalities confirms that the value of a SA linear game with antagonistic error is a conservative envelope of the true value function. It follows that if the optimal controller for the HJ SA linear game with error may succeed, it will also succeed in the true system. Unlike previous methods, this result offers the ability to safely approximate reachable sets and their corresponding controllers with the Hopf formula in a non-convex manner. Finally, we demonstrate this in the slow manifold system for clarity, and in the controlled Van der Pol system with different lifting functions.</description>

      <title>IID Prophet Inequality with Random Horizon: Going Beyond Increasing Hazard Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11752v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. In the iid model, a gambler sees values in an online fashion, sampled independently from a given distribution. Upon observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  This model has been studied with infinite, finite and unknown number of values. When the gambler faces a random number of values, the model is said to have random horizon. We consider the model in which the gambler is given a priori knowledge of the horizon's distribution. Alijani et al. (2020) designed a single-threshold algorithm achieving a ratio of $1/2$ when the random horizon has an increasing hazard rate and is independent of the values. We prove that with a single threshold, a ratio of $1/2$ is actually achievable for several larger classes of horizon distributions, with the largest being known as the $\mathcal{G}$ class in reliability theory. Moreover, we show that this does not extend to its dual, the $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$ class (which includes the decreasing hazard rate class), while it can be extended to low-variance horizons. Finally, we construct the first example of a family of horizons, for which multiple thresholds are necessary to achieve a nonzero ratio. We establish that the Secretary Problem optimal stopping rule provides one such algorithm, paving the way towards the study of the model beyond single-threshold algorithms.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing Safety and Speed: A Human-Algorithm Approach to Enhance the FDA's Medical Device Clearance Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Premarket Notification 510(k) pathway allows manufacturers to gain approval for a medical device by demonstrating its substantial equivalence to another legally marketed device. However, the inherent ambiguity of this regulatory procedure has led to high recall rates for many devices cleared through this pathway. This trend has raised significant concerns regarding the efficacy of the FDA's current approach, prompting a reassessment of the 510(k) regulatory framework. In this paper, we develop a combined human-algorithm approach to assist the FDA in improving its 510(k) medical device clearance process by reducing the risk of recalls and the workload imposed on the FDA. We first develop machine learning methods to estimate the risk of recall of 510(k) medical devices based on the information available at submission time. We then propose a data-driven clearance policy that recommends acceptance, rejection, or deferral to FDA's committees for in-depth evaluation. We conduct an empirical study using a unique large-scale dataset of over 31,000 medical devices that we assembled based on data sources from the FDA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS). A conservative evaluation of our proposed policy based on this data shows a 32.9% improvement in the recall rate and a 40.5% reduction in the FDA's workload. Our analyses also indicate that implementing our policy could result in significant annual cost savings of $1.7 billion, which highlights the value of using a holistic and data-driven approach to improve the FDA's current 510(k) medical device evaluation pathway.</description>

      <title>COS-DPO: Conditioned One-Shot Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In LLM alignment and many other ML applications, one often faces the Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning (MOFT) problem, i.e., fine-tuning an existing model with datasets labeled w.r.t. different objectives simultaneously. To address the challenge, we propose a Conditioned One-Shot fine-tuning framework (COS-DPO) that extends the Direct Preference Optimization technique, originally developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By direct conditioning on the weight across auxiliary objectives, our Weight-COS-DPO method enjoys an efficient one-shot training process for profiling the Pareto front and is capable of achieving comprehensive trade-off solutions even in the post-training stage. Based on our theoretical findings on the linear transformation properties of the loss function, we further propose the Temperature-COS-DPO method that augments the temperature parameter to the model input, enhancing the flexibility of post-training control over the trade-offs between the main and auxiliary objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the COS-DPO framework through its applications to various tasks, including the Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment tasks, highlighting its viability for large-scale ML deployments.</description>

      <title>Computing and Learning Stationary Mean Field Equilibria with Scalar Interactions: Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean field equilibrium (MFE) has emerged as a computationally tractable solution concept for large dynamic games. However, computing MFE remains challenging due to nonlinearities and the absence of contraction properties, limiting its reliability for counterfactual analysis and comparative statics. This paper focuses on MFE in dynamic models where agents interact through a scalar function of the population distribution, referred to as the scalar interaction function. Such models naturally arise in a wide range of applications involving market dynamics and strategic competition. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce iterative algorithms that leverage the scalar interaction structure and are guaranteed to converge to the MFE under mild assumptions. Leveraging this structure, we also establish an MFE existence result for non-compact state spaces and analytical comparative statics. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms with global convergence guarantees in such settings. Unlike existing approaches, our algorithms do not rely on monotonicity or contraction properties, significantly broadening their applicability. Furthermore, we provide a model-free algorithm that learns the MFE via simulation and reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning and policy gradient methods without requiring prior knowledge of payoff or transition functions. We apply our algorithms to classic models of dynamic competition, such as capacity competition, and to competitive models motivated by online marketplaces, including ridesharing and inventory competition, as well as to social learning models. We show how key market parameters influence equilibrium outcomes through reliable comparative statics in these representative models, providing insights into the design of competitive systems.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based error bounds of bilinear Koopman surrogate models for nonlinear data-driven control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive novel deterministic bounds on the approximation error of data-based bilinear surrogate models for unknown nonlinear systems. The surrogate models are constructed using kernel-based extended dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Unlike previous methods that require restrictive assumptions on the invariance of the dictionary, our approach leverages kernel-based dictionaries that allow us to control the projection error via pointwise error bounds, overcoming a significant limitation of existing theoretical guarantees. The derived state- and input-dependent error bounds allow for direct integration into Koopman-based robust controller designs with closed-loop guarantees for the unknown nonlinear system. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Data Envelopment Analysis with Robust and Closest Targets:Integrating Full-Dimensional Efficient Facets for Risk-Resilient Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the external environment become increasingly volatile and unpredictable, the selection of benchmarking targets in data envelopment analysis should account for their ability to consider risks; however, this aspect has not received sufficient attention. We propose a robust benchmarking target defined by the intersection of the maximum number of full-dimensional efficient facets, each representing a unique marginal substitution relationship. These targets can serve as robust projections for decision making units that are lacking prior risk information because they incorporate the maximum number of marginal substitution relationships. This enables decision makers to adjust their production through these relationships, thereby maximizing the likelihood of achieving globally optimal outcomes. Furthermore, we propose a novel, well-defined efficiency measure based on robust and closest targets. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed measure using a dataset comprising 38 universities from China's 985 Project.</description>

      <title>Cooperation and the Design of Public Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the cooperative elements that arise in the design of public goods, such as transportation policies and infrastructure. These involve a variety of stakeholders: governments, businesses, advocates, and users. Their eventual deployment depends on the decision maker's ability to garner sufficient support from each of these groups; we formalize these strategic requirements from the perspective of cooperative game theory. Specifically, we introduce non-transferable utility, linear production (NTU LP) games, which combine the game-theoretic tensions inherent in public decision-making with the modeling flexibility of linear programming. We derive structural properties regarding the non-emptiness, representability and complexity of the core, a solution concept that models the viability of cooperation. In particular, we provide fairly general sufficient conditions under which the core of an NTU LP game is guaranteed to be non-empty, prove that determining membership in the core is co-NP-complete, and develop a cutting plane algorithm to optimize various social welfare objectives subject to core membership. Lastly, we apply these results in a data-driven case study on service plan optimization for the Chicago bus system. As our study illustrates, cooperation is necessary for the successful deployment of transportation service plans and similar public goods, but it may also have adverse or counterintuitive distributive implications.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking for local minimizers of a free discontinuity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a functional defined on the class of piecewise constant functions, combining a jump penalization, which discourages discontinuities, with a fidelity term that penalizes deviations from a given linear function, called the forcing term.
  In one dimension, it is not difficult to see that local minimizers form staircases that approximate the forcing term. Here we show that in two dimensions symmetry breaking occurs, leading to the emergence of exotic minimizers whose level sets are not simple stripes with boundaries orthogonal to the gradient of the forcing term.
  The proof relies on a suitable adaptation of the calibration method for free discontinuity problems; as a side benefit, our version requires less regularity than the classical one.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas. For reader who are interested in our research, we release our source code at https://github.com/Cherry0302/Enhanced-TR-SCO.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods rely on the positive definite property of the Euclidean metric, and do not easily extend to the indefinite Minkowski metric. In this paper, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The method we outline is conceptually simple and easily extends to alignment problems in other matrix Lie groups.</description>
