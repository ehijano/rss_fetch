      <title>pop-cosmos: Redshifts and physical properties of KiDS-1000 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principled Bayesian inference of galaxy properties has not previously been performed for wide-area weak lensing surveys with millions of sources. We address this gap by applying the pop-cosmos generative model to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for 4 million KiDS-1000 galaxies. Calibrated on deep COSMOS2020 photometric data, pop-cosmos specifies a physically-motivated prior over the galaxy population up to $z \simeq 6$ in stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameter space. Using the Speculator SPS emulator with GPU-accelerated MCMC sampling, we perform full posterior inference at 6.5 GPU seconds per galaxy, obtaining joint constraints on galaxy redshifts and physical properties. We validate photometric redshifts against $\sim\!185,\!000$ KiDS galaxies cross-matched to DESI DR1 spectroscopic samples, achieving low bias ($3\times10^{-3}$), scatter ($\sigma_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.04$), and outlier fraction (3.7%) for the Bright Galaxy Survey, with comparable performance (bias $3\times10^{-2}$, $\sigma_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.05$, 1.3% outliers) for luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Within the LRG sample, we identify massive, dusty, star-forming contaminants at $z \simeq 0.4$ satisfying standard colour selections for quenched populations. We infer trends in stellar mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust across five tomographic redshift bins consistent with established scaling relations. Using specific star formation rate constraints, we identify $\sim$10% of KiDS-1000 galaxies as quenched, versus 37% implied by conservative colour cuts. This enables the construction of weak lensing samples defined by physical properties while mitigating intrinsic alignment systematics and preserving statistical power. Our analysis validates pop-cosmos out-of-sample, establishing it as a scaleable approach for galaxy evolution and cosmological analyses in photometric surveys.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systematics on Time Delay Lenses and the Impact on the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While time-delay lenses can be an independent probe of $H_0$ the estimates are degenerate with the convergence of the lens near the Einstein radius. Velocity dispersions, $\sigma$, can be used to break the degeneracy, with uncertainties $\Delta H/H_0 \propto \Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2$ ultimately limited by the systematic uncertainties in the kinematic measurements - measuring $H_0$ to 2% requires $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2$ &lt; 2%. Here we explore a broad range of potential systematic uncertainties contributing to eight time-delay lenses used in cosmological analyses. We find that: (1) The characterization of the PSF both in absolute scale and in shape is important, with biases in $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2$ up to 1-6%, depending on the lens system. Small slit miscenterings of the lens are less important. (2) The difference between the measured velocity dispersion and the mean square velocity needed for the Jeans equations is important, with up to $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2 \sim$ 3-8%. (3) The choice of anisotropy models is important with maximum changes of $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2 \sim$ 5-18% and the frequently used Osipkov-Merritt models do not produce $h_4$ velocity moments typical of early-type galaxies. (4) Small differences between the true stellar mass distribution and the model light profile matter ($\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2 \sim$ 5-40%), with radial color gradients further complicating the problem. Finally, we discuss how the homogeneity of the early-type galaxy population means that many dynamically related parameters must be marginalized over the lens sample as a whole and not over individual lenses.</description>

      <title>Low-mass stars dominate the hot (0.7 keV) Galactic X-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way is composed of a tenuous atmosphere filled with multi-phase plasma, including a warm-hot virialised component. Recent studies suggest a much hotter (~0.7 keV) super-virial component detected in both absorption and emission. We want to shed light on the nature of this putative super-virial component. We analysed the X-ray background as observed by SRG/eROSITA over the entire western Galactic hemisphere. We show that low-mass stars provide a large fraction of the 0.7 keV emission. Indeed, a tight correlation is found between the surface brightness of the 0.7 keV emission and the mass distribution of the Milky Way across a large portion of the western Galactic hemisphere. The correlation coefficient implies an X-ray luminosity per unit of stellar mass comparable to that of the average low-mass stars within 10 pc of the Sun, suggesting that unresolved M dwarfs and F, G, and K type stars dominate the 0.7 keV emission. This emission is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, influenced by the asymmetric distribution of nearby star-forming regions, and broadly consistent with the known offset of the Sun above the Galactic midplane. The remaining signal might be produced by the cumulative emission of stars of different types or ages, in addition to other sources (e.g. hot interstellar medium, Galactic corona, etc.). Assuming that the putative residual hot super-virial atmosphere is homogeneous and has a spherical beta profile with slope $\beta=0.4$, we constrain its density at 10 kpc to be $n_e&lt;4\times10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$. Our findings may help refine models of the circumgalactic medium around external galaxies, advancing our understanding of hot baryon flows and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>On the coupled origin of the stellar IMF and multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the solar neighborhood, the Initial Mass Function (IMF) follows is canonically described by the Salpeter power-law slope for the high-mass range. The stellar IMF may directly result from a Core Mass Function (CMF) through accretion, gravitational collapse, and fragmentation. This inheritance implies that the mass of the gaseous fragments may be connected to the properties of clustered and multiple stellar systems. We aim to (i) quantify the influence of hierarchical fragmentation of cores on the resulting IMF, and (ii) determine the consequences of this fragmentation on the multiplicity of the stellar systems. We employed a scale-free, hierarchical fragmentation model to investigate the fragmentation of top-heavy CMF. Hierarchical fragmentation of gas clumps shifts the CMF towards lower mass range and can modify its shape. Starting from the top-heavy power-law CMF observed in W43-MM2&amp;MM3 star forming region, we show that at least four levels of hierarchical fragmentation are required to generate the turn-over peak of the cIMF. Within a radius of 0.2-2.5 kAU, massive stars (M &gt; 10 Msun) have on average 0.9 companions, five times fewer than low-mass stars (M &lt; 0.1 Msun); the latter are less dynamically stable and should disperse. We show that a universal IMF can emerge from mass-dependent fragmentation processes provided that more massive cores produce less fragments compared to lower mass cores and transfer their mass less efficiently to their fragments. Hierarchical fragmentation alone cannot reconcile a universal IMF with observed stellar multiplicity. We propose that fragmentation is not scale-free but operates in two distinct regimes: a mass-dependent phase establishing the Salpeter slope and a mass-independent phase setting the turn-over. Our framework provides a way to compare core subfragmentation in various star-forming regions and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A gas-phase "top-down" chemical link between aldehydes and alcohols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alcohols and aldehydes represent two key classes of interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs). This work seeks to better understand their possible chemical connections, with a focus on such molecules in the sources of the star-forming region Sgr B2 (N). The gas-phase reaction between ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and the halogens fluorine and chlorine was investigated via DFT calculations, with the goal of determining whether astrochemically viable chemical pathways leading to acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) exist. The studied reactions were then included in an astrochemical model of Sgr B2 (N) to determine their significance under real interstellar conditions. Our DFT calculations revealed that both chlorine and fluorine can react barrierlessly with ethanol to abstract a hydrogen atom. We further found that, following this initial step, the resulting ethanol radicals can undergo further reactions with atomic hydrogen, with some routes leading to acetaldehyde. Incorporation of these novel reactions in astrochemical models of hot cores suggest that they are indeed efficient under those conditions, and can lead to modest increases in the abundance of CH3CHO during model times where gas-phase ethanol is abundant. Of the ethanol radicals included in our chemical network, we found CH3CHOH to have the highest abundances in our simulations comparable to that of ethanol at some model times. Overall, this work reveals a novel gas-phase ``top-down'' link from alcohols to aldehydes that compliments the better studied ``bottom-up'' routes involving grain-surface H-addition reactions yielding alcohols from aldehydes. Moreover, results from our astrochemical models suggest that the ethanol radical CH3CHOH may be detectable in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Formation from Hierarchical Mergers in Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense stellar environments like nuclear star clusters (NSCs) can dynamically assemble gravitational wave (GW) sources. We consider a population of single stellar mass black holes (BHs) in the inner $0.1$~pc of a NSC surrounding a $4 \times 10^6$~M$_\odot$ supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using a semianalytic model, we account for direct collisions between BHs and stars and GW capture between BHs. We explore the effect of the initial BH mass and spin distributions on their final properties and the production of GW sources. Specifically, we consider upper and lower limits for the BH initial mass distribution, and we account for the possibility that a subset of our initial population are the merger products of primordial BH binaries. We find that $\sim 500$ M$_{\odot}$ intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) can form for our upper limit mass distribution, while our lower limit mass distribution forms none. Most IMBHs $\gtrsim 200$~M$_\odot$ eventually sink towards the center of the cluster and merge with the SMBH. We also find that BH-star collisions create a more uniform spin distribution. Our results have implications for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sources. We find that the overall merger rate depends primarily on the upper limits of the initial BH mass distribution, ranging from $\sim10^{-10}$ to $\sim10^{-9}$~yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy. However, primordial binaries increase the number of second and higher generation mergers by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Kinematic-Distance Biases in the Inner Milky Way from a Stellar-Dynamically Constrained Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify how bar-driven non-circular motions bias Milky-Way gas maps inferred with the kinematic-distance (KD) method. KD reconstructions of H\,\textsc{i} and CO surveys assume circular rotation in an axisymmetric potential, an assumption that is strongly violated in the barred inner Milky Way. We use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of gas flow in an observationally constrained barred Milky Way potential. From a quasi-steady snapshot we generate synthetic longitude--velocity data and apply a standard axisymmetric KD inversion using the circular-speed curve derived from the $m=0$ component of the same potential. To isolate non-circular effects, we remove the near--far ambiguity by selecting, for each gas element, the KD branch closest to its true distance. We find that the KD method reproduces the gas distribution reasonably well outside the bar-dominated region ($R \gtrsim 5$~kpc), but fails systematically in the bar region ($R \sim 0.5$--3~kpc). There the KD-reconstructed face-on map exhibits anisotropic, quadrant-dependent artifacts, including arc-like overdensities and LOS-elongated low-density cavities. In azimuthally averaged profiles, these anisotropic misassignments translate into net radial mixing: the axisymmetric KD inversion substantially fills in the true bar-induced depression (hereafter, the ``bar gap'') and yields a flatter inner profile. Distance-error maps show coherent structures with $|\Delta d| \sim 1$--2~kpc and relative errors of several tens of percent along the bar and inner ring, coincident with zones where the KD mapping is intrinsically ill-conditioned, quantified by a large geometric sensitivity $S \equiv \left|\partial d/\partial V_{\rm LOS}^{\rm circ}\right|$. In these regions the error is well approximated to first order by $\Delta d \simeq S\,\Delta V_{\rm LOS}$, linking KD failures directly to bar-driven streaming velocities. ...</description>

      <title>A high rate of foreground contaminants toward high-redshift galaxies resolved by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) with multiple components using HST and JWST. High-redshift galaxies are mostly point-like objects on ground-based images, but they often exhibit multiple components in higher spatial resolution images. JWST for the first time allow detailed analyses on these individual components. We collect 840 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $z=2\sim7$ from the literature and nearly 50\% of them appear to have multiple components in JWST images. We further construct a sample of 248 LAEs that have two or more relatively isolated components in a circular aperture of 2$\arcsec$ in diameter. We estimate photometric redshifts for all 593 components of the 248 LAEs, and find that 68\% of them are `real components' with photometric redshifts consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts of the LAEs. The remaining components are mostly foreground objects. The fraction of the `real components' decreases rapidly with the projected distance to the LAE centers from $\sim80\%$ at $0\farcs2-0\farcs4$ to $\sim30\%$ at $0\farcs8-1\farcs0$. Our SED modeling results suggest that the majority of the LAEs are young, low-mass, low extinction starburst galaxies (partly due to a selection effect), and their `real components' have stronger star-forming activities than main-sequence galaxies. We investigate the potential impact of the high foreground contamination rate on previous studies based on ground-based images that often use a 2$\arcsec$ aperture for photometry, and find that some of key parameters such as stellar mass would have been largely affected.</description>

      <title>BEACON: JWST NIRCam Pure-parallel Imaging Survey. IV. A Systematic Search for Galaxy Overdensities and Evidence for Gas Accretion Mode Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically search for galaxy overdensities using 20 independent fields with a minimum of six filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F277W, F356W, and F444W) from BEACON, the JWST Cycle 2 NIRCam pure-parallel imaging survey. We apply an adaptive kernel-density estimation method that incorporates the full photometric redshift probability distribution function of each galaxy to map galaxy overdensities, and identify 207 significant ($&gt;4\,\sigma$) overdensities at $1.5&lt;z&lt;5$. We measure the quenched-galaxy fraction, the median specific star formation rate (sSFR), the total halo mass, and the local galaxy density of each system. By investigating the correlation among these observables, we find that galaxy quenching proceeds in two paths:($i$) Overdensities within more massive halos exhibit higher quenched fractions and lower averaged sSFRs. This trend weakens at $z\gtrsim2$, consistent with cold gas streams penetrating shock-heated massive halos and sustaining star formation activity at early times. ($ii$) We also find a dependence of the same parameters on local densities at $z&lt;2$, where the quenched fraction increases and the sSFR decreases toward higher densities. The environmental trend in sSFR weakens at $z\sim2$--$3$ and shows tentative evidence for a reversal at $z&gt;3$, potentially due to a larger cold gas supply in earlier times. Our study reveals a complex interplay between individual galaxies and large-scale environmental properties, marking the onset of environmental effects on galaxy quenching in massive halos at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Atom Addition Formation of Thionylimide (HNSO) on Interstellar Dust Grains: Chemical routes requiring oxygen and nitrogen atom surface diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of the recently detected HNSO molecule using quantum chemical calculations on ices and astrochemical models in tandem. Our results indicate that HNSO is efficiently produced on grain surfaces through reactions involving atomic oxygen and nitrogen atoms with the radicals NS and SO, forming NSO as a key intermediate. Subsequent hydrogenation of NSO leads to HNSO, with a clear preference for the lowest energy cis conformer, while the trans form is metastable and may be short-lived under typical interstellar conditions. The models predict that solid HNSO can reach abundances comparable to icy OCS, placing it among the major sulfur-bearing species in interstellar ices. Gas-phase abundances, in contrast, remain lower than those of OCS. The implementation of a multibinding scheme in our models clarifies the role of diffusive chemistry in the production of HNSO at early times, improving agreement with observations. These findings suggest that reactions involving diffusing O and N atoms on icy grains contribute significantly to sulfur chemistry and beyond in dense clouds and motivate further searches for molecules containing simultaneously H, N, O and S in other astronomical environments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Saturation of the Acoustic Resonant Drag Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant drag instabilities (RDIs) are a novel type of dust/fluid instability relevant to a diverse range of astrophysical environments. They are driven by a resonant interaction between streaming dust and waves in a background medium, which results in dust density fluctuations and amplification of the waves. This broad class of instabilities includes recently-proposed modes incorporating acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves, as well as the well-studied disk streaming instability. As the study of RDIs is at an early stage, their evolution beyond the linear regime is not well understood. In order to make inroads into the nonlinear theory of RDIs, we performed simulations of the simplest case, the acoustic RDI, in which sound waves in a gas are amplified by interaction with supersonically streaming dust. This particular instability is of interest both due its potential relevance in various poorly ionized environments, and due to its resemblance to the fast magnetosonic RDI. We find that the nonlinear growth and saturation of the instability are characterized by a balance between time scales of instability growth and turbulent eddy turnover. The simulations demonstrate a saturated state possessing an anisotropic outer forcing range in which this balance is maintained, and suggest the presence of an isotropic turbulent inertial range below this scale. By presenting a model for the nonlinear growth and saturated state of the acoustic RDI, this work provides a framework for further study of the nonlinear behavior of this and other RDIs.</description>

      <title>Evolution of dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies with UV slope, stellar mass, and redshift out to $z \sim 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We derive a dependence of the IRX on UV slope $\beta$, stellar mass $M_\ast$, and redshift out to $z \simeq 5$, and establish consistent functional relations that can be used for correcting the UV/optical-selected galaxy samples for the effects of dust absorption.
  Methods. This work is based on a $K$-band selected sample of $\sim 10^5$ star-forming galaxies detected in the UDS and COSMOS fields. Quiescent sources and known starbursts are removed, and the IR luminosities are established through stacking in FIR {\it Herschel} and JCMT maps. UV slopes are found from SED fits and stacked IRX values are derived by taking the median of individual IRX measurements in bins of $\beta$, $M_\ast$ and redshift.
  Results. While our best-fit IRX-$\beta$ relation is consistent with a Calzetti-like attenuation curve at $\beta\gtrsim -1$, at bluer values the IRX seems to increase with redshift due to different mass-completeness limits imposed. When deriving the IRX-$\beta$ relation in stellar-mass bins, a systematic trend is found, where the effective slope of the attenuation law becomes progressively shallower with increasing mass. We incorporate this into the IRX-$\beta$ relation through the slope of the underlying reddening law, $dA_{1600}/d\beta$, being a quadratic function of $\log(M_\ast/{\rm M_\odot})$. Expressing IRX as a function of the stellar mass we find a tight correlation, with IRX rising monotonically with mass but exhibiting a clear high-mass turnover at $z\lesssim 2-3$, consistent with suppressed cold-gas accretion and dust growth in massive systems.</description>

      <title>Discovery of crested quasi-periodic eruptions following the most luminous SRG/eROSITA tidal disruption event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of complex flaring activity from the galactic nucleus hosting the five-year-old tidal disruption event eRASSt J234402.9-352640 (J2344). With Einstein Probe and XMM-Newton observations, we detected highly structured soft X-ray variability. Through temporal decomposition of the XMM-Newton light curve and time-resolved spectral analysis, we identified broad, thermal flares recurring every $\sim$12 hours and lasting $\sim$2 hours, consistent with quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). Remarkably, these QPEs are accompanied by an unprecedented crest of hotter, shorter flares, each lasting between 5 and 30 minutes. These flares are predominantly found in the rising phases of the QPEs, although they also appear throughout the quiescence. These findings establish J2344 as a new member of the QPE emitter population and uncover a previously unobserved phenomenology that challenges current models of QPEs. In this letter, we present the phenomenological properties of this unique source and discuss possible interpretations within the framework of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>SN 2017ati: A luminous type IIb explosion from a massive progenitor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type~IIb supernova (SN)~2017ati. It reached the maximum light at about 27~d after the explosion and the light curve shows a broad, luminous peak with an absolute $r$-band magnitude of $M_{r} = -18.48 \pm 0.16$~mag. At about 50~d after maximum light, SN~2017ati exhibits a decline rate close to that expected from the $^{56}$Co $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe radioactive decay, at 0.98 mag per 100 days, as usually observed in SNe IIb. However, it remains systematically brighter at late times by about 1--2~mag, exceeding the usual upper luminosity range of this class. As a result, modelling the light curve of SN~2017ati with a standard $^{56}$Ni decay scenario requires a large nickel mass of up to $\sim0.37\,M_{\odot}$ and still fails to reproduce the early-time light curve adequately. In contrast, incorporating additional energy input from a magnetar yields a significantly improved fit to the light curve of SN~2017ati, which would reduce the nickel mass to $\sim0.21\,M_{\odot}$, still close to the upper end of the range typically inferred for SNe~IIb. Comparing the fitted results of SN~2017ati with the known sample of SNe~IIb indicates that its luminosity evolution is best explained by a combination of neutron star spin-down energy and radioactive nickel deposition. From late-time nebular spectra of SN~2017ati, the luminosity of the [\Oi]~$\lambda\lambda6300,6364$ doublet implies an oxygen mass of $\sim1.82-3.34\,M_{\odot}$, and the combination of a [\Caii]/[\Oi] flux ratio of $\sim0.5$ with nebular spectral model comparisons favours a progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of $\geq17\,M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Large-scale halo velocity correlations and the impact of finite simulation volumes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The velocity correlation functions directly measured from the peculiar velocity field of dark matter in numerical simulations are known to have an amplitude lower than that predicted by theoretical models at large scales. The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $f\sigma_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators.</description>

      <title>Separation of polarized dust emission in Planck observations with Scattering Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized dust emission is a major astrophysical foreground contaminant of the cosmic microwave background polarization (CMB), which must be accurately measured to look for the faint primordial polarization B-modes of inflationary origin. The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Ray Lines -- Signatures of Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Rays, Positron Annihilation, and Fundamental Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear $\gamma$-ray lines in the MeV range of the electromagnetic spectrum hold a vast variety of astrophysical, particle-physical, and fundamental physical information that is otherwise extreme difficult to access. MeV $\gamma$-ray line observations provide the most direct evidence for ongoing nucleosynthesis in galaxies by measuring freshly produced radioactive isotopes from massive stars, supernovae, classical novae, or binary neutron star mergers. Their flux ratios can determine the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum in different objects and of the Milky Way as a whole. Different phases of the interstellar medium are traced by hot nucleosynthesis ejecta, cooling positrons, or cosmic-ray interactions with molecular clouds. Positron annihilation itself can be considered as an astrophysical messenger as their production and destruction in typical space environments is inevitable. Finally, as-of-yet unknown signatures from beyond standard model physics might have their elusive imprints in $\gamma$-ray lines. This Chapter gives an overview of historical $\gamma$-ray line measurements, newest results, and open questions that may only be solved by a new generation of MeV telescopes.</description>

      <title>The incidence of LBV variability in the LMC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous blue variables (LBVs) exhibit unique variability features, characterized by episodic outbursts ($&gt;$1 mag) accompanied by spectroscopic changes (S Dor variables). It is debated if all massive stars undergo an LBV-like phase during their evolution, or instead LBVs are exotic phenomena. We aim to quantify the incidence of LBV-like variability in the blue supergiant (BSgs) population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the OGLE survey. Here, we extend previous work in the Small Magellanic Cloud to the LMC, where we examine the light curves of 87 B Supergiants (BSgs) (out of 254 known BSgs) spanning timescales of twenty years, and 37 objects across a three year timescale for aperiodic variations resembling known S Dor variables. One blue supergiant, [ST92] 4-13 shows S Dor type photometric variations. New spectra of this object reveals a potential change in spectral type compared to the literature classification. However, based on its spectral characteristics and low luminosity and mass, we do not currently classify it as an LBV. Our study highlights the need to classify bona fide LBVs as stars undergoing both photometric and spectroscopic variations. Based on currently known stellar population of S Dor variables in the LMC, the lifetime of the S Dor phase is at most $\sim$10$^3$ yrs, in agreement with our duty cycle study based on OGLE data in the SMC. This is orders of magnitude shorter than assumed in literature. Our discovery of LBV-like variability at low luminosities may suggest that S Dor variations could arise from Eddington limit related physics over a wide range of stellar masses, rather than being linked to a unique evolutionary stage.</description>

      <title>Wide binaries without viable bound Newtonian orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Wide binaries offer a unique opportunity to test gravity in the low acceleration regime, where deviations from Newtonian dynamics may appear. Aims. We use high-resolution VLT-ESPRESSO archival spectra to study 26 wide binaries with projected separations larger than 13,000 AU. By combining precise radial velocities with Gaia proper motions and parallaxes, we aim to test whether these systems are consistent with Newtonian gravity in the low acceleration regime. Methods. We use multiple radial velocity measurements and stellar parameters to remove systems affected by unresolved triples, chance alignments, or young systems. For the remaining binaries, we combine radial velocities (corrected for convective shift and gravitational redshift) with Gaia proper motions, parallaxes, and positions to attempt bound Newtonian orbital solutions Results. Fourteen of the 26 initial systems were discarded: 12 due to radial velocity variability indicating unresolved close binaries, one hosting a faint Gaia companion, and one too young. Of the remaining 12, nine can be fitted with bound orbital solution, while three show velocity differences too large to be reconciled with any bound Newtonian orbit. Conclusions. For the three systems that cannot be fitted with a bound orbit, repeated radial velocity observations allow us to confidently exclude, with one possible exception, unresolved triple stellar companions or massive close-in planets as causes. Given their likely large 3-dimensional separations, these binaries may have been dynamically perturbed or disrupted by stellar encounters or Galactic tides, and may no longer be gravitationally bound. This highlights how utmost caution must be applied when studying wide binaries as isolated systems.</description>

      <title>EPISODE III: The Nested Jet/Outflow Morphology of EC 53 Revealed by JWST and ALMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extensive study of the structure and kinematics of the jet and outflow of EC 53, a Class I protostar with a quasi-periodic variability, using combined James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. ALMA continuum observations resolve a compact disk with a radius of $\sim$0.14\arcsec\ (60\,au). Scattered light from the outflow cavity is prominent in the short-wavelength NIRCam and NIRSpec observations, revealing only the southeast nearside lobe. We detected 27 H$_2$ emission lines tracing a narrow, cone-shaped structure within the outflow cavity. A high-velocity ionized jet is detected in several forbidden atomic lines, characterized by a position angle of 142\degree, an opening angle of 1.4\degree, and an estimated geometric launching radius of at most $\sim$40\,au. Mid-infrared CO ro-vibrational emission lines, stronger in the P-branch, show a similar distribution to the H$_2$ emission and are likely to originate from hot gas within the outflow cavity. CO and C$_2$H emission lines detected by ALMA trace slower, colder outflow components and cavity walls. The spatial and kinematic stratification between the hot atomic and molecular components and the colder molecular gas is consistent with predictions from MHD disk wind models, although envelope material entrained by a wide-angle wind or jet may also contribute. Our analysis highlights the powerful synergy between JWST and ALMA in advancing the understanding of protostellar jets and outflows across multiple spatial and physical scales.</description>

      <title>A Two-Dimensional Analytic Solution for the Generation of Hyperbolic Trajectories Via A Single Close Encounter with Applications To Interstellar Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of interstellar interlopers such as 1I/`Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS have highlighted the necessity of understanding the dynamical pathways that eject small bodies from planetary systems into hyperbolic trajectories. In this paper we examine the orbital elements of particles in the restricted three-body problem prior to and post scattering onto hyperbolic trajectories by massive perturbers. Building on previous work, we calculate closed-form -- but approximate -- analytic criteria that map pre- to post-encounter orbital elements. An application of these equations demonstrates that ejection occurs most efficiently when the orbital eccentricity of the massless test particle exceeds a minimum threshold, $e\gtrsim0.4$. The primary driver of the final eccentricity is the component of the perturber-centric velocity projected along the direction of motion of the perturber. These analytic criteria are then benchmarked and validated against numerical simulations which demonstrate that they provide a reasonably good zeroth-order approximation for ejection behavior. However, system-specific cases will generally require numerical simulations in addition to this analytic construction. The methodology is applied to (i) the solar system and exoplanetary systems (ii) $\beta$ Pictoris and (iii) HR 8799 to evaluate the pre-scattering orbits of ejected particles. This method provides a transparent and computationally efficient tool for identifying orbits within a given system from which interstellar objects are efficiently ejected via a single scattering event from a massive perturber.</description>

Abstract: Galactic rotation curves are crucial for understanding the distribution of mass in galaxies. Despite advances in precision observations, there are discrepancies between the inferred mass from luminosity and the observed rotational velocities, often attributed to dark matter. While traditional parametric models provide valuable insights, they struggle with complex galactic features like prominent bulges and non-circular motions. In this study, we apply artificial neural networks to generate robust, data-driven models, tailored to each galaxy, for the rotation curves of spiral galaxies using high-quality observational data. Our approach demonstrates that neural networks can effectively capture the intricate structure of rotation curves without relying on predefined astrophysical assumptions. By comparing the data-based models with the Navarro-Frenk-White model under two different assumptions for the stellar component, we classify galaxies based on the model that best fits their rotation curves, offering insights into the limitations and strengths of both theoretical and data-based methods. This work highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in identifying galaxies whose dynamics are not well captured by standard theoretical models, pointing to the need for more refined physical descriptions.</description>

Abstract: We present a new approach for understanding how galaxies lose or retain baryons by utilizing a pipeline of two machine learning methods applied the IllustrisTNG100 simulation. We employed a Random Forest Regressor and Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) model to connect the retained baryon fraction of approximately 10^5 simulated galaxies to their properties. We employed Random Forest models to filter and used the five most significant properties to train an EBM. Interaction functions identified by the EBM highlight the relationship between baryon fraction and three different galactic mass measurements, the location of the rotation curve peak, and the velocity dispersion. This interpretable machine learning-based approach provides a promising pathway for understanding the baryon cycle in galaxies.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: Estimating Physical Parameters of Galaxies Using Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data, notably, near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset down to $\sim28$ mag (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies -- redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age -- directly from photometric data out to $z=3.5$. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto 2D maps, showing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions. We first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers robust estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics ($\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ typically between $0.1$--$0.3$, and Pearson correlation between $0.7$ and $0.9$) confirm the precision of the method, with $\sim$ $70\%$ of predictions within 1$\sigma$ dex of reference values. Although redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web remains challenging (median $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}} = 0.04$), the overall success of the highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation. A key advance of this work is the use of JWST/NIRCam photometry, particularly the F444W band, which enhances SOM training and allows more accurate estimation of stellar mass, SFR, and age compared to previous studies using IRAC/Spitzer filters.</description>

      <title>Novel method to trace the dark matter density profile around supermassive black holes with AGN reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping (RM) measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The mapping of multiple emission lines allows the measurement of the enclosed mass within different radii from the central SMBH, which can be used to infer or constrain the dark matter density profile on sub-parsec scales. We apply a toy model based on this method to a sample of fourteen AGN to test its feasibility based on current measurements. We find that for five objects, the observed enclosed mass does grow with radii, hinting towards the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2 $\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$, consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by stellar heating processes. The enclosed dark matter mass, however, is found to be significantly larger than expected. We show that the current RM based mass measurements suffer from large systematic uncertainties, that limit the effectiveness of our method. Our work emphasizes the importance of applying the recent developments in mass determination techniques to target multiple emission lines with future RM and interferometry campaigns. This provides the most direct way of constraining the dark matter density in the sub-parsec regions around extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>MIRACLE II: Unveiling the multi-phase gas interplay in the circumnuclear region of NGC 1365 via multi-cloud modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08077v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases.
  MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (&lt;25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material.
  The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions.
  Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet.
  For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Modeling of Supernova Remnants Collisions: Implications for Triggered Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical models of star formation consistently underestimate the rates observed in astronomical surveys. Stars form within giant molecular clouds, which fragment into dense clumps under the combined influences of turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation, and gravity. While some of these clumps collapse spontaneously, others require an external trigger, a mechanism estimated to account for 14%-25% of star formation in regions such as the Elephant Trunk Nebula. Laboratory astrophysics has emerged as a powerful approach for investigating such triggering processes, in particular those involving supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent experiments, guided by well-established scaling laws, have successfully replicated the dynamics of SNRs and their interactions with dense clumps or other SNRs. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of these experimental configurations using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics code TROLL. The simulations provide enhanced insight into the underlying physical mechanisms, accurately reproduce key experimental phenomena, and offer valuable comparisons with analytical models. This study underscores the strong synergy between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, laying a robust foundation for future advancements in laboratory astrophysics. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental setup that offers improved scaling for the asymmetric collision observed in the DEM L316 system. Our findings also show that SNR collisions in dense environments can decrease the gravitational stability of dense clumps, thereby promoting their collapse and potentially triggering star formation.</description>

      <title>The GUAPOS project. VI: the chemical inventory of shocked gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the chemical composition of star-forming regions is key to understanding the chemical ingredients available during the formation of planetary systems. Because the chemical inventory of interstellar dust grains in prestellar phases might be altered by protostellar warming, an alternative to inferring the chemical composition of the grains might be to observe regions that are affected by shocks associated with molecular outflows. These shocks can desorb the molecules and might produce less chemical processing because the timescales are shorter. We present a detailed study of the chemical reservoir of a shocked region located in the G31.41+0.31 protocluster using data from the G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey (GUAPOS). We report the detection of 30 molecular species (plus 18 isotopologs). We compared the molecular ratios in the shocked region with those derived toward the hot core of G31.41+0.31. They are poorly correlated, with the exception of N-bearing species. Our results confirm observationally that a different level of chemical alteration is present in hot cores and in shocks. While the former likely alter the molecular ratios by thermal processing during longer timescales, the latter might represent freshly desorbed material that constitutes a better proxy of the composition of the ice mantle. The similarity of the molecular ratios of the N-bearing species in the G31.41+0.31 shock and the hot core suggests that these species are predominantly formed at early evolutionary stages. Interestingly, the abundances in the G31.41+0.31 shock are better correlated with other shock-dominated regions (two protostellar outflows and a molecular cloud in the Galactic center). This suggests that gas-phase chemistry after shock-induced ejection from grains is negligible and that the composition of the ice mantle is similar regardless of the Galactic environment.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution of Nuclear Star Clusters and Massive Black Holes: Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in the co-evolution of massive black holes (MBHs) and nuclear star clusters (NSCs), which host diverse stellar populations across a wide range of masses. The dynamics are simulated self-consistently with GNC, which we have updated to incorporate gravitational wave orbital decay, the loss cone of a spinning MBH, and stellar evolution. Over $12$ Gyr, we investigate the evolution of the NSC with a mass-growing MBH, as well as the EMRIs of stellar black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs (BDs), and low-mass main-sequence stars (MSs), along with tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving MSs, BDs, and post-MSs. The mass growth of the MBH contributed by TDEs is typically $\sim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$, $\sim 10^6\,M_{\odot}$, and $\sim 5\times10^4\,M_{\odot}$ for massive, Milky-Way-like, and smaller NSCs, respectively. Between $40\%$ and $70\%$ of the stellar mass is lost during stellar evolution, which dominates the mass growth of the MBH if a significant fraction of the lost mass is accreted. The evolution of EMRI rates is generally affected by the cluster's size expansion or contraction, stellar population evolution, MBH mass growth, and the stellar initial mass function. The EMRI rates for compact objects peak at early epochs ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) and then gradually decline over cosmic time. LISA-band ($0.1$ mHz) EMRIs involving compact objects around Milky-Way-like MBHs tend to have high eccentricities, while those around spinning MBHs preferentially occupy low-inclination (prograde) orbits. In contrast, MS- and BD-EMRIs usually have eccentricity and inclination distributions that are distinct from those of compact objects.</description>

      <title>The multimessenger view of Pulsar Timing Array black holes with the Horizon-AGN simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio $&gt;3$ to be $4\%$ ($20\%$) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range $0.05-1$, with chirp masses of $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass $\sim 10^{13}\, M_\odot$. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with $f_{\rm Edd}&gt;10^{-3}$ can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at $f=1/\rm yr$, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.</description>

      <title>A Possible "Too-Many-Satellites" Problem in the Isolated Dwarf Galaxy DDO 161</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundance of satellite galaxies provides a direct test of $\Lambda$CDM and galaxy formation physics on small scales. While satellites of Milky Way-mass galaxies are well studied, those of dwarf galaxies remain largely unexplored. We present a systematic search for satellites around the isolated dwarf galaxy DDO~161 ($M_\star \approx 10^{8.4}\, M_\odot$) at a distance of 6 Mpc. We identify eight satellite candidates within the projected virial radius and confirm three new satellites through surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements from deep Magellan imaging data. Together with its confirmed satellite UGCA~319, DDO~161 has four confirmed satellites above $M_{\star}^{\rm sat} &gt; 10^{5.4}\, M_\odot$, making it the most satellite-rich dwarf galaxy known to date. We compare this system with predictions from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, combined with currently established galaxy-halo connection models calibrated on Milky Way satellites, and find that DDO~161 has a satellite abundance far exceeding all current expectations. The rich satellite system of DDO~161 offers new insight into how low-mass galaxies occupy dark matter halos in low-density environments and may provide new constraints on the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Mean Mass Density near the Sun from the Divergence Theorem and Pulsar Accelerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new, non-parametric method for estimating the mass enclosed within a sphere of arbitrary radius centered on the Sun. The method is based on the divergence theorem as applied to measurements of the line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars. We describe a procedure for inferring the mean mass density within a sphere of a given radius centered on the Sun and find results that are consistent with previous analyses. When combined with a model for the distribution of baryons, this provides the mean mass density of dark matter as a function of distance from the Sun, rather than a single value as is typically reported by kinematic studies. However, with the present pulsar data, the method cannot unambiguously measure a signal from the local distribution of dark matter at this time; such a measurement is expected to soon become possible as the amount of pulsar acceleration data grows and its precision improves. We derive an extension of the well-known shell theorem to a spherical-harmonics expansion of the density and potential, and use the result to obtain estimates for density asymmetries with respect to the Galactic midplane from the observed acceleration data. The predicted asymmetries do not follow the observed distribution of MW disk stars or gas; this can potentially be explained by a non-uniform distribution of dark matter in the Solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>MAGellanic Outflow and chemistry Survey (MAGOS): Hot cores in the LMC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) provides a key laboratory for exploring the diversity of star formation and interstellar chemistry under subsolar metallicity conditions. We present the results of a hot core survey toward 30 massive protostellar objects in the LMC using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 350 GHz. Continuum imaging reveals 36 compact sources in total, among which line analyses identify 9 hot cores and 1 hot-core candidate, including two newly identified sources. We detect CO, HCO+, H13CO+, HC15N, HC3N, SiO, SO, SO+, NS, SO2, 34SO2, 33SO2, CH3OH, 13CH3OH, HCOOH, HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, H2CCO (tentative), and hydrogen recombination lines from hot cores. CH3OCH3, a complex organic molecule larger than CH3OH, is detected for the first time in a hot core outside the LMC bar region. All hot cores show stronger emission in the high-excitation SO line compared to non-hot-core sources, suggesting that its strong detection will be useful for identifying hot-core candidates in the LMC. Chemical analysis reveals a spread of more than two orders of magnitude in CH3OH abundances, with some sources deficient in COMs. In contrast, SO2 is detected in all hot cores, and its abundance shows a good correlation with rotational temperature. The hot cores without CH3OH detections are all located outside the LMC bar region and are characterized by either high luminosity or active star formation in their surroundings. A combination of locally low metallicity, active star formation in the vicinity, and high protostellar luminosity may jointly trigger the COM-poor hot core chemistry observed in the LMC.</description>

Abstract: We present a deep photometric study of the globular cluster NGC 5466 and its tidal stream using Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging with the metallicity-sensitive narrowband filter NB395. We develop an improved member-selection technique based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm applied to the color-color-magnitude diagram (CCMD), enabling reliable candidate identification down to $i_{2,0} &lt; 23.5$. Photometric metallicities derived from NB395 colors agree with previous measurements, supporting the robustness of our calibration. While modest residual contamination and possible offsets - potentially driven by variations in light-element abundances - may remain beyond 10 arcmin, the metallicity distribution of high-probability inner members matches the known mean metallicity of NGC 5466, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The spatial distribution of NB395-selected stars clearly delineates the tidal stream. Beyond the tidal radius, the azimuthally averaged radial surface density profile follows a power law with slope $\alpha = -4.53_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$. We also detect a power-law component perpendicular to the stream, suggestive of multiple apogalactic passages. A density gap is identified at a projected distance of $\sim200$ pc from the cluster center, consistent with eTidal N-body predictions and possibly associated with a recent pericentric passage or Galactic disk interaction. Analysis of the main-sequence mass function reveals a strong negative radial gradient in the slope within the tidal radius, whereas the slope along the outer stream is relatively flat, consistent with preferential tidal stripping of low-mass stars. These results highlight the power of HSC/NB395 photometry for identifying metal-poor populations and deriving photometric metallicities, underscoring its value for future wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>Inference on inner galaxy structure via gravitational waves from supermassive binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar-timing arrays indicates the presence of a population of supermassive black hole binaries. Although the observed spectrum generally matches predictions for orbital evolution driven by gravitational-wave emission in circular orbits, there is a preference for a spectral turnover at the lowest observed frequencies, which may point to substantial hardening during a transition from early environmental influences to later stages dominated by emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. Here we model how the gravitational-wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile before scouring by binary ejections while accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. By analysing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we find that a parsec-scale galactic-centre density of around $10^6 M_{\odot} \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ is favoured across most of the parameter space, thus shedding light on the environmental effects that shape black hole evolution and the combined matter density near galaxy centres.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Stacking as a Line Intensity Mapping Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is a growing technique that measures the integrated spectral-line emission from unresolved galaxies over a three-dimensional region of the Universe. Although LIM experiments ultimately aim to provide powerful cosmological constraints via auto-correlation, many LIM experiments are also designed to take advantage of overlapping galaxy surveys, enabling joint analyses of the two datasets. We introduce a flexible simulation pipeline that can generate mock galaxy surveys and mock LIM data simultaneously for the same population of simulated galaxies. Using this pipeline, we explore a simple joint analysis technique: three-dimensional co-addition (stacking) of LIM data on the positions of galaxies from a traditional galaxy catalogue. We test how the output of this technique reacts to changes in experimental design of both the LIM experiment and the galaxy survey, its sensitivity to various astrophysical parameters, and its susceptibility to common systematic errors. We find that an ideal catalogue for a stacking analysis targets as many high-mass dark matter halos as possible. We also find that the signal in a LIM stacking analysis originates almost entirely from the large-scale clustering of halos around the catalogue objects, rather than the catalogue objects themselves. While stacking is a sensitive and conceptually simple way to achieve a LIM detection, thus providing a valuable way to validate a LIM auto-correlation detection, it will likely require a full cross-correlation to achieve further characterization of the galaxy tracers involved, as the cosmological and astrophysical parameters we explore here have degenerate effects on the stack.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Matter with Mass Segregation: A Unified Explanation of Dwarf Cores and Small-Scale Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-component self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models with inter-species interactions, mass segregation arises naturally from collisional relaxation, enhancing central densities and gravothermal evolution. We demonstrate that models with velocity-dependent interactions, both within and between species, can connect several small-scale observations while remaining consistent with cluster-scale constraints. This combination enables core formation in dwarf halos, where the presence of baryons increases the inner densities and enhances the predicted strong lensing signatures. Using cosmological and controlled simulations alongside an accurate parametric model, we present proof-of-principle examples showing that this framework can explain the structure of dark perturbers observed in strong lensing systems, and can enhance the efficiency of small-scale lenses by a factor of a few, in line with the excess reported in galaxy-galaxy strong-lensing observations. Importantly, mass segregation can enhance the Einstein radii of SIDM halos relative to their cold dark matter (CDM) counterparts, overcoming a key challenge in one-component SIDM scenarios. Our results present mass segregation in two-component SIDM as a self-consistent, testable framework with the potential to address multiple small-scale challenges in structure formation.</description>

      <title>NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory Observations of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the observation and measurement of astrometry, photometry, morphology, and activityof the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, also designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) with the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, was discovered on UT 2025 July 1. Rubin Observatory had coincidentally collected images of the object's region of the sky during routine commissioning. Facilitated by Rubin's high resolution and large aperture, we successfully recovered object detections from Rubin observations spanning UT 2025 June 21 (10 days before discovery, when 3I/ATLAS was 4.5 au from the Sun) through the date of discovery, and we acquired additional images through UT 2025 July 20 as part of commissioning. We measure on-sky locations of 3I/ATLAS in Rubin ugrizy bands, with a typical precision of about 70 mas, and briefly describe the reason this is coarser than our measured static source astrometric precision of about 3 mas in Rubin images. We measure grizy magnitudes of 3I/ATLAS photometry at about 0.01 mag precision, detecting no short-term photometric variability above 0.01 mag. We derive an estimated near-nucleus dust-to-nucleus scattering cross-section ratio of eta &gt;= 13 on UT 2025 July 2 based on Rubin photometry and an upper limit nucleus size computed from Hubble Space Telescope observations. We find Rubin colors of g - r = (0.657 +/- 0.013) mag, r - i = (0.235 +/- 0.018) mag, i - z = (0.147 +/- 0.042) mag, z - y = (0.047 +/- 0.052) mag. These data represent the earliest observations of this object by a large (&gt;=8-meter class) telescope and illustrate the type of measurements (and discoveries) Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will begin to provide after it begins in early 2026.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Magnetohydrodynamics: A New Two-Moment Framework with Numerical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) play a pivotal role in various astrophysical systems, delivering feedback over a broad range of scales. However, modeling CR transport remains challenging due to its inherently multi-scale nature and complex microphysics. Recent advances in two-moment CR hydrodynamics have alleviated some of these challenges, improving understanding of CR feedback. Yet, current two-moment methods may not be able to directly incorporate all relevant CR transport processes, while the outcome of CR feedback sensitively depends on these underlying microphysics. Furthermore, numerical challenges persist, including instabilities from streaming terms and ambiguities in solver design for coupled CR-MHD systems. In this work, we develop a two-moment description for CR hydrodynamics from first principles. Beyond canonical CR streaming, our formulation accounts for CR pressure anisotropy and Alfv\'en waves propagating in both directions along the magnetic field, providing a general framework to incorporate more CR transport physics. We implement this framework as a new CR fluid module in the \textit{Athena}++ code, and validate it through a suite of benchmark tests. In particular, we derive the full dispersion relation of the two-moment CR-MHD system, identifying the CR-acoustic instability as well as other wave branches. These CR-MHD waves serve as rigorous benchmarks and also enable the use of realistic signal speeds in our Riemann solver. We propose a time step guideline to mitigate numerical instabilities arising from streaming source terms.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of non-singular black holes at finite size: a ray tracing approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational microlensing of various static and spherically symmetric non-singular black holes (and horizonless, non-singular compact objects of similar size). For pointlike sources we extend the parametrized post-Newtonian lensing framework to fourth order, whereas for extended sources we develop a ray tracing approach via a simple radiative transfer model. Modelling non-relativistic proper motion of the lens in front of a background star we record the apparent brightness as a function of time, resulting in a photometric lightcurve. Taking the star radius to smaller values, our numerical results approach the theoretical predictions for point-like sources. Compared to the Schwarzschild metric in an otherwise unmodified lensing geometry, we find that non-singular black hole models (and their horizonless, non-singular counterparts) both at finite size and for point lenses tend to feature larger magnifications in microlensing lightcurves.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to estimate the spectral index, $\beta_s$, of polarised synchrotron emission, combining the moment expansion of CMB and the constrained-ILC. We reconstructed the maps of the first two synchrotron moments, combining multi-frequency data, and applied the `T-T plot' technique between two moment maps to estimate the synchrotron spectral index. This approach offers a new technique for mapping the foreground spectral parameters, complementing the model-based parametric component separation methods. Applying this technique, we derived a new constraint on the spectral index of polarised synchrotron emission using QUIJOTE MFI wide-survey 11 and 13 GHz data, Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data at K and Ka bands, and Planck LFI 30 GHz data. In the Galactic plane and North Polar Spur regions, we obtained an inverse-variance-weighted mean synchrotron index of $\beta_s = -3.11$ with a standard deviation of $0.21$ due to intrinsic scatter, consistent with previous results based on parametric methods using the same dataset. We find that the inverse-variance-weighted mean spectral index, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties, is $\beta_s^{\rm plane} = -3.05 \pm 0.01$ in the Galactic plane and $\beta_s^{\rm high\text{-}lat} = -3.13 \pm 0.02$ at high latitudes, indicating a moderate steepening of the spectral index from low to high Galactic latitudes. Our analysis indicates that, within the current upper limit on the Anomalous Microwave Emission polarisation fraction, our results are not subject to any appreciable bias. Furthermore, we infer the spectral index over the entire QUIJOTE survey region, partitioning the sky into 21 patches. This technique can be further extended to constrain the synchrotron spectral curvature by reconstructing higher-order moments when better-quality data become available.</description>

      <title>VLBI astrometry of radio stars to link radio and optical celestial reference frames. II. 11 radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The alignment between the radio-based International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and the optical Gaia Celestial Reference Frame (Gaia-CRF) is critical for multi-waveband astronomy, yet systematic offsets at the optical bright end (G&lt;13) limit their consistency. While radio stars offer a potential link between these frames, their utility has been restricted by the scarcity of precise Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. In this study, we present new VLBI astrometry of 11 radio stars using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), expanding the existing sample with positions, parallaxes, and proper motions measured. All 11 radio stars were detected, for 10 of which parallaxes and proper motions can be estimated, achieving median uncertainties better than 0.1 mas and 0.1 mas/yr, respectively. These new samples greatly contribute to the link between ICRF and Gaia-CRF at the optical bright end.</description>

      <title>Cosmological redshift of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole: Towards estimating the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we estimate the parameters of several astrophysical black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei by studying the kinematics of test objects in their accretion disk. First, we derive expressions for the redshift and blueshift of photons emitted by a massive particle circularly orbiting a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, and detected by a distant receding observer. The frequency-shift depends on the mass and distance of the black hole, the orbital radius of the photon source, as well as the Hubble constant, directly relating these quantities to astrophysical observables, namely, the redshift and the angular position of the emitting particle on the sky. We apply for the first time this theoretical model, which accounts for the universe expansion through the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, to real astrophysical systems using megamaser galaxies within the Hubble flow, namely UGC 3789, NGC 5765b, NGC 6264, NGC 6323, and CGCG 074-064. Bayesian inference based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods is employed to estimate the mass-to-distance ratio, the product of the Hubble constant with the distance, and the black hole angular position. Additionally, by assuming a Gaussian prior on the Hubble constant, the mass, distance, and the Hubble constant are also estimated. Furthermore, we find that cosmic expansion is embedded in the gravitational contribution of the frequency-shift within this spacetime metric. Therefore, our results introduce a general relativistic framework that accounts for cosmic expansion and differs from the standard empirical Hubble law.</description>

      <title>The steep redshift evolution of the hierarchical binary black hole merger rate may cause the $z$-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $17.0^{+18.3}_{-4.4},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($10.5^{+29.7}_{-4.7},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.0\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.03^{+0.05}_{-0.02}$, compared to $0.09^{+0.11}_{-0.07}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.</description>

      <title>The X-ray properties and structure of A3571 up to $R_{500}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abell 3571 is a nearby, X-ray bright galaxy cluster located in the Shapley Supercluster. Although it appears morphologically relaxed in X-ray images, multiwavelength observations reveal subtle indications of residual dynamical activity, likely associated with past merger events. Using wide-field ($1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$) data from the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT), we extend measurements of the cluster's properties beyond its $R_{500}$ radius. We detect surface-brightness excesses on both the northern and southern sides, consistent with previous XMM-Newton results. The temperature, pressure, and entropy in the northern excess region are lower than the average values, whereas those on the southern side are slightly higher. However, we find no evidence for cold fronts or shocks. These features can be interpreted as sloshing motions triggered by an off-center minor merger. Our findings suggest that, despite its symmetric appearance, A3571 is still recovering from a minor merger and is currently in a post-merger phase. This work also demonstrates the excellent capability of EP-FXT for probing the outskirts of galaxy clusters.</description>
