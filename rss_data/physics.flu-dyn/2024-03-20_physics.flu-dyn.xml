      <title>Coriolis effects on wind turbine wakes across atmospheric boundary layer regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind turbines operate in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), where Coriolis effects are present. As wind turbines with larger rotor diameters are deployed, the wake structures that they create in the ABL also increase in length. Contemporary utility-scale wind turbines operate at rotor diameter-based Rossby numbers, the nondimensional ratio between inertial and Coriolis forces, of O(100) where Coriolis effects become increasingly relevant. Coriolis forces provide a direct forcing on the wake, but also affect the ABL base flow, which indirectly influences wake evolution. These effects may constructively or destructively interfere because both the magnitude and sign of the direct and indirect Coriolis effects depend on the Rossby number, turbulence, and buoyancy effects in the ABL. Using large eddy simulations, we investigate wake evolution over a wide range of Rossby numbers relevant to offshore wind turbines. Through an analysis of the streamwise and lateral momentum budgets, we show that Coriolis effects have a small impact on the wake recovery rate, but Coriolis effects induce significant wake deflections which can be parsed into two regimes. For high Rossby numbers (weak Coriolis forcing), wakes deflect clockwise in the northern hemisphere. By contrast, for low Rossby numbers (strong Coriolis forcing), wakes deflect anti-clockwise. Decreasing the Rossby number results in increasingly anti-clockwise wake deflections. The transition point between clockwise and anti-clockwise deflection depends on the direct Coriolis forcing, pressure gradients, and turbulent fluxes in the wake. At a Rossby number of 125, Coriolis deflections are comparable to wake deflections induced by 17{\deg} of yaw-misalignment.</description>

      <title>The advancing wave front on a sloping channel covered by a rod canopy following an instantaneous dam break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drag coefficient $C_d$ for a rigid and uniformly distributed rod canopy covering a sloping channel following the instantaneous collapse of a dam was examined using flume experiments. The measurements included space $x$ and time $t$ high resolution images of the water surface $h(x,t)$ for multiple channel bed slopes $S_o$ and water depths behind the dam $H_o$ along with drag estimates provided by sequential load cells. Analysis of the Saint-Venant Equation (SVE) for the front speed using the diffusive wave approximation lead to a front velocity $U_f=\sqrt{\Gamma_h 2 g \phi_v'/(C_d m D)}$, where $\Gamma_h=-\partial h/\partial x$, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, $\phi_v'=1-\phi_v$ is fluid volume fraction per ground area, $\phi_v=m \pi D^2/4$ is the solid volume fraction per ground area, $m$ is the number of rods per ground area, and $D$ is the rod diameter. An inferred $C_d=0.4$ from the $h(x,t)$ data near the advancing front region, also confirmed by load cell measurements, is much reduced relative to its independently measured steady-uniform flow case. This finding suggests that drag reduction mechanisms associated with transients and flow disturbances are more likely to play a dominant role when compared to conventional sheltering or blocking effects on $C_d$ examined in uniform flow. The increased air volume entrained into the advancing wave front region as determined from an inflow-outflow volume balance partly explains the $C_d$ reduction from unity.</description>

      <title>Phase field modelling of the detachment of bubbles from a solid substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the evolution and detachment of a gas bubble resting on a solid substrate and surrounded by a viscous liquid. The bubble has a static contact angle $\theta $ and will be subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the cricital Bond number over which bubbles detach from the substrate. Then, we perform similar studies for bubble resting on inclined substrates and bubbles under the action of an external flow. We provide approximate formulas for the critical Bond number under all these circumstances. Our method is also able to resolve the pinchoff of the bubble and the possible appearence of satellites.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh Taylor Instability in Multiple Finite-Thickness Fluid Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general transfer-matrix formalism for determining the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a fluid system with spatially varying density and viscosity. We use this formalism to analytically and numerically treat the case of a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We introduce the inviscid-flow approximation in our transfer-matrix formalism to find analytic solutions in the limit of uniform kinematic viscosity for a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We discuss the applicability of these results and the no-acceleration approximation that also yields analytical solutions in the large viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Wave Turbulence of a Liquid Surface Using the Dynamic Conformal Transformation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic conformal transformation method has been generalized for the first time to numerically simulate the capillary wave turbulence of a liquid surface in the plane symmetric anisotropic geometry. The model is strongly nonlinear and involves effects of surface tension, as well as energy dissipation and pumping. Simulation results have shown that the system of nonlinear capillary waves can pass to the quasistationary chaotic motion regime (wave turbulence). The calculated exponents of spectra do not coincide with those for the classical Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum for isotropic capillary turbulence but are in good agreement with the estimate obtained under the assumption of the dominant effect of five-wave resonant interactions.</description>

      <title>Surfactant-laden liquid thread breakup driven by thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakup of liquid threads into droplets is crucial in various applications, such as nanoprinting, nanomanufacturing, and inkjet printing, where a detailed understanding of the thinning neck dynamics allows for a precise droplet control. Here, the role of surfactant in the breakup process is studied by many-body dissipative particle dynamics, in particular, the various regime transitions and thread profiles, shedding light on molecular-level intricacies of this process hitherto inaccessible to continuum theory and experiments. Moreover, the role of surfactant in the most unstable perturbation, the formed droplet size, and surfactant distributions have been unraveled. As surfactant concentration rises, both the wavelength and time to breakup steadily increase due to the lowering of surface tension below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and viscous effects introduced by micelles above the CMC. These changes prior to the breakup lead to larger droplets being formed in cases with higher surfactant concentration. We also compared the thinning dynamics to existing theoretical predictions, revealing that the surfactant-laden breakup starts at the inertial regime and transitions into the thermal fluctuation regime when the concentration is increased. Thus, we illuminate the hitherto poorly investigated and intricate breakup process of surfactant-laden liquid threads driven by thermal fluctuations, contributing to a deeper understanding of this process at molecular scales.</description>

      <title>Intricacies of CO2-Basalt Interactions, Reactive Flow and Carbon Mineralization: Bridging Numerical Forecasts to Empirical Realities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsurface fluid flow and solute transport are pivotal in addressing pressing energy, environmental, and societal challenges, such as geological CO2 storage. Basaltic rocks have gained prominence as suitable geological substrates for injecting substantial CO2 volumes and carbon mineralization, driven by their widespread occurrence, high concentrations of cation-rich silicate minerals, reported fast mineralization rate, and favorable characteristics such as porosity, permeability, and injectivity. The mineralization process within basaltic rocks is intricately linked, involving the dissolution of silicate minerals and the subsequent precipitation of carbonate minerals. Columnar flow and batch surface growth experiments revealed the spontaneous formation of a limited number of large crystals at various locations, rationalized by the overarching influence of probabilistic mineral nucleation. Experiments with CO2-acidified brine versus freshwater prove to be more challenging regarding the sweet spots for heavy carbon mineralization due to clay formation on the surface, particularly smectites. Despite numerical predictions suggesting the formation of MgFeCa-carbonates in CO2-basalt interactions at higher temperatures, our laboratory findings primarily indicated the growth of calcium carbonates. The experimental and numerical outcomes highlight the necessity of a probabilistic approach for accurately modeling reaction kinetics, crystal growth distribution, and the dynamic interplay between reactive flow, geochemical reactions, mineral carbonation, and geometry alteration.</description>

      <title>Boundary layers in thermal convection are fluctuation-dominated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of thermal and momentum boundary layers in three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection for the Rayleigh number range $10^5 \le Ra \le 10^{11}$ and $Pr=0.7$. Using a Cartesian slab with horizontal periodic boundary conditions and an aspect ratio of 4, we obtain statistical homogeneity in the horizontal $x$- and $y$-directions, thus approximating an infinitely extended system. We observe that upon canonical use of long-time and area averages, a coherent mean flow is practically absent. Instead, the velocity field close to the wall is a collection of differently oriented local shear patches interspersed by shear-free, incoherent flow regions. These shear patches occupy an area fraction of approximately $40\%$ for all $Ra$. Rather than resulting in a pronounced mean with small fluctuations about it, the velocity field is dominated by strong fluctuations of all three components around a non-existent or weak mean. This feature is particularly pronounced for $Ra \ge 10^9$. We discuss the consequences of these observations for convection layers with larger aspect ratios, including boundary layer instabilities and the resulting turbulent heat transport.</description>

      <title>Simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics in the vicinity of a critical endpoint belonging to the universality class of the Ising model. This study is motivated by the challenge of modeling the dynamics of critical fluctuations near a conjectured critical endpoint in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We focus on the interaction of shear modes with a conserved scalar density, which is known as model H. We show that the observed dynamical scaling behavior depends on the correlation length and the shear viscosity of the fluid. As the correlation length is increased or the viscosity is decreased we observe a cross-over from the dynamical exponent of critical diffusion, $z\simeq 4$, to the expected scaling exponent of model H, $z\simeq 3$. We use our method to investigate time-dependent correlation function of non-Gaussian moments $M^n(t)$ of the order parameter. We find that the relaxation time depends in non-trivial manner on the power $n$.</description>

      <title>Coalescence induced late departure of bubbles improves water electrolysis efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the effects of bubble collisions and coalescence on electrolysis performance using micro-electrodes in a 0.5 M H2SO4. We observe that the addition of electrolytes such as HClO4, despite increasing conductivity, significantly reduces energy conversion efficiency by inhibiting bubble coalescence. A phase diagram illustrates the trade-off between improved conductivity and inhibition of coalescence with varying concentrations of supporting electrolytes (HClO4 or Na2SO4) at different electrolysis current. Contrary to conventional understanding, we find that larger bubbles resulting from coalescence enhance efficiency. This can be attributed to the early release of smaller bubbles, approximately 10 micron in size, facilitated by the coalescence of the surface microbubble and the just-detached large bubble. Additionally, the merge of two bubbles, at a critical velocity of ~2 m/s, enhances agitation at the electrode surface that significantly improves electrolyte transport within the stagnant layer. These findings challenge conventional perspectives on bubble detachment size and suggest innovative approaches to optimize energy consumption in electrolysis, especially in systems where the bubble coalescence is inhibited, such as alkaline water electrolysis and the chlor-alkali industry.</description>

      <title>Large-scale flood modeling and forecasting with FloodCast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale hydrodynamic models generally rely on fixed-resolution spatial grids and model parameters as well as incurring a high computational cost. This limits their ability to accurately forecast flood crests and issue time-critical hazard warnings. In this work, we build a fast, stable, accurate, resolution-invariant, and geometry-adaptative flood modeling and forecasting framework that can perform at large scales, namely FloodCast. The framework comprises two main modules: multi-satellite observation and hydrodynamic modeling. In the multi-satellite observation module, a real-time unsupervised change detection method and a rainfall processing and analysis tool are proposed to harness the full potential of multi-satellite observations in large-scale flood prediction. In the hydrodynamic modeling module, a geometry-adaptive physics-informed neural solver (GeoPINS) is introduced, benefiting from the absence of a requirement for training data in physics-informed neural networks and featuring a fast, accurate, and resolution-invariant architecture with Fourier neural operators. GeoPINS demonstrates impressive performance on popular PDEs across regular and irregular domains. Building upon GeoPINS, we propose a sequence-to-sequence GeoPINS model to handle long-term temporal series and extensive spatial domains in large-scale flood modeling. Next, we establish a benchmark dataset in the 2022 Pakistan flood to assess various flood prediction methods. Finally, we validate the model in three dimensions - flood inundation range, depth, and transferability of spatiotemporal downscaling. Traditional hydrodynamics and sequence-to-sequence GeoPINS exhibit exceptional agreement during high water levels, while comparative assessments with SAR-based flood depth data show that sequence-to-sequence GeoPINS outperforms traditional hydrodynamics, with smaller prediction errors.</description>

      <title>Mass Flows in Expanding Coronal Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An expansion of cross-sectional area directly impacts the mass flow along a coronal loop, and significantly alters the radiative and hydrodynamic evolution of that loop as a result. Previous studies have found that an area expansion from chromosphere to corona significantly lengthens the cooling time of the corona, and appears to suppress draining from the corona. In this work, we examine the fluid dynamics to understand how the mass flow rate, the energy balance, and the cooling and draining timescales are affected by a non-uniform area. We find that in loops with moderate or large expansion (cross-sectional area expansion factors of 2, 3, 10, 30, 100 from photosphere to apex), impulsive heating, for either direct thermal heating or electron beam heating, induces a steady flow into the corona, so that the coronal density continues to rise during the cooling phase, whereas a uniform loop drains during the cooling phase. The induced upflow carries energy into the corona, balancing the losses from thermal conduction, and continues until thermal conduction weakens enough so that it can no longer support the radiative losses of the transition region (TR). As a result, the plasma cools primarily radiatively until the onset of catastrophic collapse. The speed and duration of the induced upflow both increase in proportion to the rate of area expansion. We argue that observations of blue-shifted spectral lines, therefore, could place a constraint on a loop's area expansion.</description>

      <title>Impact of Engine Nacelle Flow on Buffet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transonic flow around the OAT15A airfoil is computed at buffet conditions, i.e., freestream Mach number $Ma_\infty = 0.73$, chord-based freestream Reynolds number $Re_c = 2\cdot10^6$, and angle of attack $\alpha = 3.5^\circ$ using wall-modeled LES. Two configurations are considered, one which includes a generic ultra-high bypass ratio (UHBR) engine nacelle geometry and one without an engine, which is denoted the baseline case. The introduction of the UHBR-engine nacelle leads to a significant deviation of the flow onto the airfoil from the baseline case and has an essential effect on the occurring shock dynamics. The flow field of the nacelle configuration is characterized by a shock wave on the upper part of the nacelle sharing dynamic features with the shock on the airfoil. This impact of the nacelle shock on the airfoil shock means a reduced strength of the airfoil shock resulting in a less developed buffet. The perturbation of the general flow field is evaluated as to established buffet models and the dynamic features of the shock waves are analyzed by the sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition. This analysis shows the existence of a shared dynamic mode of the nacelle and the airfoil shock which suggests a coupling mechanism between them.</description>

      <title>Connecting finite-time Lyapunov exponents with supersaturation and droplet dynamics in the bulk of a turbulent cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of turbulent mixing on the droplet size distribution is studied deep inside a warm ice-free cloud. A simplified cloud mixing model was implemented therefore which summarizes the balance equations of water vapor mixing ratio and temperature to an effective advection-diffusion equation for the supersaturation field $s(\textbf{x},t)$. Our three-dimensional direct numerical simulations connect the scalar supersaturation field to the cloud droplet dynamics, in particular to the droplet size distribution for different box sizes. In addition, finite-time Lyapunov exponents are monitored such that we can relate regions of higher compressive strain to those of high local supersaturation amplitudes. We find that the mixing process in terms of the droplet evaporation is always homogeneous in the bulk of the cloud, while being inhomogeneous in view to the relaxation of the supersaturation field. The probability density function of $\lambda_3$ is related to the one of $s$ by a simple one-dimensional aggregation model. The distributions of the compressive finite-time Lyapunov exponents $\lambda_3$, the supersaturation field, and the droplet size are found to be Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of vorticity in unbounded flow from limited pressure measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the instantaneous inference of an unbounded planar flow from sparse noisy pressure measurements. The true flow field comprises one or more regularized point vortices of various strength and size. We interpret the true flow's measurements with a vortex estimator, also consisting of regularized vortices, and attempt to infer the positions and strengths of this estimator assuming little prior knowledge. The problem often has several possible solutions, many due to a variety of symmetries. To deal with this ill-posedness and to quantify the uncertainty, we develop the vortex estimator in a Bayesian setting. We use Markov-chain Monte Carlo and a Gaussian mixture model to sample and categorize the probable vortex states in the posterior distribution, tailoring the prior to avoid spurious solutions. Through experiments with one or more true vortices, we reveal many aspects of the vortex inference problem. With fewer sensors than states, the estimator infers a manifold of equally-possible states. Using one more sensor than states ensures that no cases of rank deficiency arise. Uncertainty grows rapidly with distance when a vortex lies outside of the vicinity of the sensors. Vortex size cannot be reliably inferred, but the position and strength of a larger vortex can be estimated with a much smaller one. In estimates of multiple vortices their individual signs are discernible because of the non-linear coupling in the pressure. When the true vortex state is inferred from an estimator of fewer vortices, the estimate approximately aggregates the true vortices where possible.</description>

      <title>More considerations about the symmetry of the stress tensor of fluids</title>

Abstract: Regarding a recent dispute about the symmetry of the stress tensor of fluids, more considerations are presented. The usual proofs of this symmetry are reviewed, and contradictions between this symmetry and the mechanism of gas viscosity are analyzed for simple gas flows. It is emphasized that these proofs may not be valid because they depend on the theorem of angular momentum which preassumes that the internal forces between any two fluid particles are always along the line connecting them. From Newton's laws of motion, however, one can only obtain the theorem of angular momentum with an additional term. It is proved that this additional term represents the total moment of internal forces in a fluid, both by using continuum model and by considering the microscopic structure of the fluid. In the latter case, this term has the form of the total moment of the forces exerted on the nuclei by the electrons. This moment of internal forces may lead to nonsymmetry of the stress tensor and is in general nonzero as long as shear stress exists. A nonsymmetrical stress tensor suggested in the literature is discussed in terms of its effect in eliminating the contradictions and simplifying the Navier-Stokes equation. The derivation of this stress tensor for ideal gases based on the kinetic theory of gas molecules is presented, and its form in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system is given. Finally, a possible experimental verification of this nonsymmetrical stress tensor is discussed.</description>

      <title>Fully Eulerian models for the numerical simulation of capsules with an elastic bulk nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational framework based on fully Eulerian models for fluid-structure interaction for the numerical simulation of biological capsules. The flexibility of such models, given by the Eulerian treatment of the interface and deformations, allows us to easily deal with the large deformations experienced by the capsule. The modeling of the membrane is based on a full membrane elasticity Eulerian model that is capable of capturing both area and shear variations thanks to the so-called backward characteristics. In the validation section several test cases are presented with the goal of comparing our results to others present in the literature. In this part, the comparisons are done with different well-known configurations (capsule in shear flow and square-section channel), and by deepening the effect of the elastic constitutive law and capillary number on the membrane dynamics. Finally, to show the potential of this framework we introduce a new test case that describes the relaxation of a capsule in an opening channel. In order to increase the challenges of this test we study the influence of an internal nucleus, modeled as a hyperelastic solid, on the membrane evolution. Several numerical simulations of a 3D relaxation phenomenon are presented to provide characteristic shapes and curves related to the capsule deformations, while also modifying size and stiffness parameter of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for the hydrodynamics of the classical one-component plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic equations for a one-component plasma are derived as a generalization of the Euler equations to include the effects of the long-range Coulomb interaction. By using a variational principle, these equations self-consistently unify thermodynamics, dispersion laws, nonlinear motion, and conservation laws. In the moderate and strong coupling limits, it is argued that these equations work down to the length scale of the average interparticle spacing. Closure and self-consistency of these nonlocal equations are achieved via the implementation of a variational principle. Hydrodynamic equations are evaluated in both the Eulerian frame, where the dependent variables depend on the position in the laboratory, and the Lagrangian frame, where they depend on the position in some reference state, such as the initial position. Each frame has its advantages and our final theory combines elements of both. The properties of longitudinal and transverse dispersion laws are calculated for the hydrodynamic equations. A simple step function approximation for the pair distribution function is used that allows for simple calculations that reveal the structure of the equations of motion. The obtained dispersion laws are compared to molecular dynamics simulations and the theory of quasilocalized charge approximation. The action, which gives excellent agreement for both longitudinal and transverse dispersion laws for a wide range of coupling strengths, is elucidated. Agreement with numerical experiments shows that such a hydrodynamic approach can be used to accurately describe a one-component plasma at very small length scales comparable to the average interparticle spacing. The validity of this approach suggests considering nonlinear flows and other systems with long-range interactions in the future.</description>

      <title>Relativistic second-order dissipative and anisotropic fluid dynamics in the relaxation-time approximation for an ideal gas of massive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study all transport coefficients of second-order dissipative fluid dynamics derived by V. E. Ambrus et al. [Phys. Rev. D 106, 076005 (2022)] from the relativistic Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation for the collision integral. These transport coefficients are computed for a classical ideal gas of massive particles, with and without taking into account the conservation of intrinsic quantum numbers. Through rigorous comparison between kinetic theory, second-order dissipative fluid dynamics, and leading-order anisotropic fluid dynamics for a (0+1)--dimensional boost-invariant flow scenario, we show that both fluid-dynamical theories describe the early far-from-equilibrium stage of the expansion reasonably well.</description>
