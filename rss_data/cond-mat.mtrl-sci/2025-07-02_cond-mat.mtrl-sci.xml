      <title>Electronic structure and optical absorption of armchair graphene/boron nitride lateral heterostructures from first principles and models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic and optical properties of lateral heterostructures made of alternated armchair ribbons of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. We employ ab initio theories (DFT and the G0W0 method) as well as a tight-binding ladder model originally introduced to study the gapwidth of isolated nanoribbons. After investigating the charge distribution across the interface, we identify the nature of the states around the gap and scrutinize their evolution as a function of the characteristic dimensions of the system (the graphene ribbons' width N and the boron nitride ribbons' width L). We also disclose how the very interface between graphene and boron nitride changes the electronic properties of both materials with respect to the corresponding isolated nanoribbons. Finally we discuss the light absorption properties of these systems by deriving specific selection rules for the heterostructures and calculating spectra from first principles in the independent particle and the random phase approximations</description>

      <title>Deformation band patterns and dislocation structures in finite strain crystal viscoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformation band patterning in single crystals is investigated using a finite strain crystal viscoplasticity model based on the evolution of dislocation densities. In the presence of strong latent hardening and weak rate dependence, the deformation organizes into laminate microstructures consisting of single-slip regions separated by dislocation walls. The influence of material and numerical parameters on the nucleation and morphology of these patterns is analyzed in 2D single crystals under plane strain compression. Pattern formation is also observed in 3D single-crystal cylinders subjected to tension, where the characteristic size of deformation microstructures is found to depend on mesh size and boundary conditions in the absence of an intrinsic material length scale. To address this limitation, strain gradient plasticity is introduced, providing a length scale that governs the size of the patterns. Finally, we demonstrate that deformation patterns and dislocation structures also emerge in 2D and 3D polycrystals, highlighting the generality of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Engineering NV Centers via Hydrogen-Driven Defect Chemistry in CVD Diamonds for Quantum Applications: NVHx Dissociations into NV, Origin of 468nm Center, and Cause of Brown Coloration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high NV center conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in advancing diamond-based quantum technologies. The generally accepted mechanism for NV formation is that irradiation-induced vacancies become mobile during annealing and are trapped by substitutional nitrogen. However, the suggested mechanism does not consider the presence and role of hydrogen in the diamond and its influence on the NV formation pathway. This is despite ab-initio calculations, which strongly suggest the formation of hydrogen-passivated NV centers during CVD diamond growth. Recent experimental observations showing a strong spatial correlation between NV centers, brown coloration, and the 468 nm luminescence center in as-grown CVD diamonds prompted us to investigate the atomistic origin of these phenomena in the presence of NxVHy-type complex defects. We used hybrid density functional theory DFT calculations and spectroscopic analysis of CVD diamonds grown with varying nitrogen content to investigate defect equilibria during growth. We identified the 468 nm center as the NVH- defect, a hydrogen-passivated NV center, and assigned the characteristic UV-VIS absorption bands at 270 360 and 520 nm to NxVHy complexes. Our findings reveal that hydrogen plays a central role in stabilizing these defects during growth. We further showed that NVHx complex defects dissociate into NV centers and interstitial hydrogen during post-growth irradiation and annealing, complementing vacancy trapping by substitutional nitrogen. These results provide a unified picture of the defect chemistry underlying brown coloration, 468 nm center, and NV formation in CVD diamonds, offering new insights for optimizing diamond synthesis and processing for quantum applications by taking advantage of hydrogens role and dissociation of NVHx complexes.</description>

      <title>Phase field dislocation dynamics study of grain boundary-dislocation interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new phase field dislocation dynamics formulation is presented, which couples micromechanical solvers and the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. Grain boundary (GB)-dislocation interactions are studied by describing GBs as inclusions. Grain boundary properties are computed from Molecular Statics simulations and an additional contribution to the total energy that takes into account the GB energy is considered in the calculations. Interaction of a screw dislocation with minimum energy and metastable states of low and high angle $\langle$110$\rangle$ symmetric tilt grain boundaries are studied. We show good agreement between predictions from our phase field dislocation dynamics formulation and molecular dynamics simulations of grain boundary-dislocation interactions.</description>

      <title>Termination-Dependent Resistive Switching in SrTiO$_3$ Valence Change Memory Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valence change memory (VCM) cells based on SrTiO$_3$ (STO), a perovskite oxide, are a promising type of emerging memory device. While the operational principle of most VCM cells relies on the growth and dissolution of one or multiple conductive filaments, those based on STO are known to exhibit a distinctive, 'interface-type' switching, which is associated with the modulation of the Schottky barrier at their active electrode. Still, a detailed picture of the processes that lead to interface-type switching is not available. In this work, we use a fully atomistic and ab initio model to study the resistive switching of a Pt-STO-Ti stack. We identify that the termination of the crystalline STO plays a decisive role in the switching mechanism, depending on the relative band alignment between the material and the Pt electrode. In particular, we show that the accumulation of oxygen vacancies at the Pt side can be at the origin of resistive switching in TiO$_2$-terminated devices by lowering the conduction band minimum of the STO layer, thus facilitating transmission through the Schottky barrier. Moreover, we investigate the possibility of filamentary switching in STO and reveal that it is most likely to occur at the Pt electrode of the SrO-terminated cells.</description>

      <title>Quenching of excitons at grain boundaries in C60 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton lifetimes play a critical role in the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. In this work, we investigate how the presence of multiple rotational domains, and therefore grain boundaries, impacts exciton dynamics in thin films of C60/Au(111) using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). We find that films with multiple rotational domains exhibit shorter exciton lifetimes and evidence of exciton-exciton annihilation, even when one domain predominates. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements reveal electronic structure changes resulting from a locally reduced dielectric constant at grain boundaries, providing a mechanism for lifetime reduction through exciton funneling and other additional decay channels. These findings highlight the critical role of film quality in determining intrinsic exciton lifetimes, and show that minuscule amounts of disorder that are nearly undetectable by ensemble measurements can significantly impact dynamics. These results imply that precise structural control is essential for optimize the performance of organic optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>AstroECP: towards more practical Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based technique that enables bulk-sample characterization of crystallographic defects (e.g. dislocations, stacking faults, low angle boundaries). Despite its potential, ECCI remains underused for quantitative defect analysis as compared to transmission electron microscope (TEM) based methods. Here, we overcome barriers that limit the use of ECCI including optimizing signal-to-noise contrast, precise determination of the incident beam vector with calibrated and easy to use simulations and experimental selected area electron channeling patterns (SA-ECP). We introduce a systematic ECCI workflow, alongside a new open-source software tool (AstroECP), that includes calibration of stage tilting, SA-ECP field of view, and the energy that forms the ECP/ECCI contrast using dynamical simulations. The functionality of this workflow is demonstrated with case studies that include threading dislocations in GaAs and the cross validation of precession based ECCI-contrast, which is otherwise known as Electron Channeling Orientation Determination (eCHORD). To assist the reader, we also provide best practice guidelines for ECCI implementation to promote high-resolution defect imaging in the SEM.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond photocurrents by the Dresselhaus bulk spin-galvanic effect in an inversion-asymmetric ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ultrafast photocurrents in thin films of a model ferromagnetic metal with broken bulk inversion symmetry, the half-metallic Heusler compound NiMnSb, following excitation with an optical pump pulse with photon energy 1.55 eV. Remarkably, in terms of the direction of the sample magnetization M, all photocurrents are found to be a superposition of a component with Rashba- and Dresselhaus-type symmetry. We explain the Dresselhaus bulk photocurrent as follows: Pump-induced electron heating induces an excess of spin {\mu}_s||M, which transfers spin angular momentum into states with Dresselhaus-type spin-momentum locking. The resulting charge current relaxes on a time scale of 10 fs by momentum relaxation and, thus, follows {\mu}_s quasi-instantaneously. The relaxation of {\mu}_s is governed by the cooling of the electrons and not by the significantly slower spin-lattice relaxation of half-metals. Our findings add the Dresselhaus spin-galvanic effect (SGE) to the set of ultrafast spin-charge-conversion phenomena. They indicate a route to more efficient spintronic terahertz emitters and detectors based on the volume scaling of the bulk SGE.</description>

      <title>Generation of Pure Spin Current with Insulating Antiferromagnetic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of pure spin currents is critical for low-dissipation spintronic applications, yet existing methods relying on spin-orbit coupling or ferromagnetic interfaces face challenges in material compatibility and operational robustness. We propose a paradigm-shifting approach to generate symmetry-protected pure spin currents by applying mechanical stress on insulating antiferromagnetic materials, i.e., the pure piezospintronic effect. We first classify magnetic point groups enabling pure piezospintronic effects. A novel first-principles method is developed to compute the spin dipole moments and coefficients of the piezospintronic effect. Integrating these methodologies with high-throughput screening, we identify FeOOH, Cr2O3 and NaMnX (X=As, Bi, P, Sb) with significant pure piezospintronic effects. Interestingly, we reveal that the ionic displacement contribution dominates the piezospintronic effect, in contrast to the piezoelectric effect. Our study not only provides first-principles approach for investigating spin dipole moment related phenomena (e.g., ferrotoroidicity, fractional quantum spin dipole moment, piezospintronics), but also provide promising piezospintronic materials for experimental verification and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing ferroelectric stability: Wide-range of adaptive control in epitaxial HfO2/ZrO2 superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metastability of the polar phase in HfO2, despite its excellent compatibility with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process, remains a key obstacle for its industrial applications. Traditional stabilization approaches, such as doping, often induce crystal defects and impose constraints on the thickness of ferroelectric HfO2 thin films. These limitations render the ferroelectric properties vulnerable to degradation, particularly due to phase transitions under operational conditions. Here, we demonstrate robust ferroelectricity in high-quality epitaxial (HfO2)n/(ZrO2)n superlattices, which exhibit significantly enhanced ferroelectric stability across an extended thickness range. Optimized-period superlattices maintain stable ferroelectricity from up to 100 nm, excellent fatigue resistance exceeding 109 switching cycles, and a low coercive field of ~0.85 MV/cm. First-principles calculations reveal that the kinetic energy barrier of phase transition and interfacial formation energy are crucial factors in suppressing the formation of non-polar phases. This work establishes a versatile platform for exploring high-performance fluorite-structured superlattices and advances the integration of HfO2-based ferroelectrics into a broader range of applications.</description>

      <title>Second-order microscopic nonlinear susceptibility in a centrosymmetric material: application to imaging valence electron motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of phase-matched nonlinear x-ray and optical sum-frequency generation from single-crystal silicon using sub-resonant 0.95 eV laser pulses and 9.5 keV hard x-ray pulses from the LCLS free-electron laser. The sum-frequency signal appears as energy and momentum sidebands to the elastic Bragg peak. It is proportional to the magnitude squared of the relevant temporal and spatial Fourier components of the optically induced microscopic charges/currents. We measure the first- and second-order sideband to the 220 Bragg peak and find that the efficiency is maximized when the applied field is along the reciprocal lattice vector. For an optical intensity of $\sim10^{12} \text{W}/\text{cm}^2$, we measure peak efficiencies of $3\times 10^{-7}$ and $3\times 10^{-10}$ for the first and second-order sideband respectively (relative to the elastic Bragg peak). The first-order sideband is consistent with induced microscopic currents along the applied electric field (consistent with an isotropic response). The second-order sideband depends nontrivially on the optical field orientation and is consistent with an anisotropic response originating from induced charges along the bonds with C$_{3v}$ site symmetry. The results agree well with first-principles Bloch-Floquet calculations.</description>

      <title>Process-aware and high-fidelity microstructure generation using stable diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.</description>

      <title>Influence of oxygen-defects on intraband terahertz conductivity of carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional charge transport properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) enable numerous ultrafast optoelectronic applications. Modifying SWCNTs by introducing defects significantly impacts the performance of nanotube-based devices, making defect characterization crucial. This research tracked these effects in oxygen plasma-treated SWCNT thin films. Sub-picosecond electric fields of varying strengths and additional photoexcitation were used to assess how defects influence charge carrier transport. Changes in effective conductivity within the terahertz (THz) range were found to be strongly dependent on impurity levels. The plasmon resonance shift to higher THz frequencies aligns with the defect-induced reduction in conductivity and slowed carrier migration within the network. An increase in THz field strength resulted in diminished conductivity due to intraband absorption bleaching. To address the emergence of hot charge carriers, a modified Drude model, which considers non-equilibrium charge carrier distribution via fielddependent scattering rates, was applied. The dominant charge-impurity scattering rate in plasma-treated samples corresponded with an increase in defects. Additionally, the impact of defects on charge carrier dynamics on a picosecond timescale was examined. The modeled plasma-treated SWCNTs wire-grid polarizer for the THz range reveals the potential for multi-level engineering of THz devices to customize properties through controlled defect populations.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent Resonant X-ray Inelastic Scattering at Ni L3-edge for NaNiO2 and LiNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiNiO2 is a promising cathode material for Li-ion battery but its atomic and electronic structure is under debate. Indeed, two sets of Ni-O distances are identified from local structural probes that are related with either Jahn-Teller distortion or bond disproportionation of NiO6 octahedra. Moreover, LiNiO2 undergoes a monoclinic to rhombohedral transition at 200 K which origin is still unclear. On the other hand, isostructural NaNiO2 shows differences from LiNiO2, as it is a well-known Jahn-Teller distorted system, and it undergoes monoclinic to rhombohedral transition at 500 K associated to the loss of the Jahn-Teller distortion. To understand better these differences, we report here Ni L3-edge Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments on LiNiO2 and NaNiO2 at different temperatures (25 to 520 K) and follow the spectral changes below and above the phase transition temperatures. The observed RIXS spectra and the mapping indicate strong spectral changes for NaNiO2 confirming the disappearance of Jahn-Teller distortion during phase transition while the changes are minor for LiNiO2 suggesting very few modifications in the local structure. Theoretical simulations of RIXS spectra are required for further understanding, however, we believe that the reported dataset can be a crucial resource for developing advanced simulations that are essential to deepening our understanding of the atomic and electronic structure of these nickelates.</description>

      <title>Monolayer Two-dimensional Materials Database (ML2DDB) and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) materials with tailored properties is critical to meet the increasing demands of high-performance applications across flexible electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, and energy storage. However, current 2D material databases are constrained by limited scale and compositional diversity. In this study, we introduce a scalable active learning workflow that integrates deep neural networks with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to efficiently explore a vast set of candidate structures. These structures are generated through physics-informed elemental substitution strategies, enabling broad and systematic discovery of stable 2D materials. Through six iterative screening cycles, we established the creation of the Monolayer 2D Materials Database (ML2DDB), which contains 242,546 DFT-validated stable structures-an order-of-magnitude increase over the largest known 2D materials databases. In particular, the number of ternary and quaternary compounds showed the most significant increase. Combining this database with a generative diffusion model, we demonstrated effective structure generation under specified chemistry and symmetry constraints. This work accomplished an organically interconnected loop of 2D material data expansion and application, which provides a new paradigm for the discovery of new materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the impact of trivalent metal cation transmutation on Cs$_{2}$AgM(III)Cl$_{6}$ double perovskites using many-body perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free halide double perovskites A$_{2}$M(I)M(III)X$_{6}$ have garnered significant attention in the past decade as promising alternatives to CsPbX$_{3}$ perovskites, addressing concerns related to lead toxicity and material instability. In this work, we employ a trivalent metal cation transmutation strategy to design a series of inorganic Pb-free halide double perovskites Cs$_{2}$AgM(III)Cl$_{6}$ and perform a comprehensive investigation into their potential for applications in optoelectronic devices. Our first-principles calculations, rooted in density functional theory, demonstrate that these materials possess a face-centered cubic lattice structure while showcasing remarkable thermodynamic, dynamical, and mechanical stability. The G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE electronic bandgap ranges from 1.47-6.20 eV, while the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) indicates strong optical absorption spanning near-infrared to ultraviolet regions for these compounds. Furthermore, the excitonic properties suggest that these perovskites exhibit intermediate exciton binding energies (0.17 to 0.60 eV) and generally longer exciton lifetimes, except for the materials with M(III) = Sc, Y, Tb, and Lu. The Fr\"ohlich model indicates that these materials exhibit intermediate to strong carrier-phonon interactions, with hole-phonon coupling more prominent than electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, the charge-separated polaronic states are found to be less stable than the bound exciton states, with higher polaron mobility for electrons (4.92-29.03 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) than for holes (0.56-8.69 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) in these materials. Overall, our study demonstrates that trivalent metal cation transmutation in Cs$_{2}$AgM(III)Cl$_{6}$ enables the creation of stable and lead-free halide double perovskites with exceptional, tunable optoelectronic properties, making them ideal for flexible optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>High pressure synthesis and structural study of AuGa2 intermetallic compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of the AuGa2 intermetallic compound, using a direct reaction of the relevant elements at room temperature and at very low pressure. The pressure needed to synthesize the AuGa2 compound is below 1 GPa, that is at the lower limit of modern large volume presses, routinely used to synthesize other commercially available materials. This study presents a new method of synthesizing AuGa2, which is much more cost efficient and environmentally friendly than the previously used high-temperature synthesis techniques, and will open new possibilities of synthesizing other intermetallic compounds using high-pressure athermal techniques.</description>

      <title>Structural, dielectric, and ferroelectric characteristics of the low-temperature sintered 65PMN-35PT sample for electroceramic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single-phase 65PMN-35PT ceramic was synthesized at a relatively low temperature (875 oC) using a modified columbite method. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the single-phase formation of perovskite 65PMN-35PT with a tetragonal structure. Morphological studies indicated that the sample consisted of small grains with a size of about 2 micro-m. The dielectric properties of the material demonstrate its relaxor behavior near the ferroelectric transition temperature, TC = 457 K. The saturation and remnant polarization values of approximately 25.9 and 20.1 micro-C cm-2 were achieved for an electrically poled sample. Additionally, the poling induced a negative internal electric field of about -0.2 kV cm-1 was detected due to the presence of ferroelectric nano-grains in this bulk 65PMN-35PT sample. These observed characteristics of the pyrochlore-free 65PMN-35PT ceramic are similar to those of its single-crystal counterpart.</description>

      <title>Testing the spin-bath view of self-attention: A Hamiltonian analysis of GPT-2 Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p&lt;10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable, physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter physics and AI.</description>

      <title>The interplay of ferroelectricity and magneto-transport in non-magnetic moir\'{e} superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of ferroelectricity and magnetic order provides rich tunability for engineering material properties and demonstrates great potential for uncovering novel quantum phenomena and multifunctional devices. Here, we report interfacial ferroelectricity in moir\'{e} superlattices constructed from graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. We observe ferroelectric polarization in an across-layer moir\'{e} superlattice with an intercalated layer, demonstrating a remnant polarization comparable to its non-intercalated counterpart. Remarkably, we reveal a magnetic-field enhancement of ferroelectric polarization that persists up to room temperature, showcasing an unconventional amplification of ferroelectricity in materials lacking magnetic elements. This phenomenon, consistent across devices with varying layer configurations, arises purely from electronic rather than ionic contributions. Furthermore, the ferroelectric polarization in turn modulates quantum transport characteristics, suppressing Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and altering quantum Hall states in polarized phases. This interplay between ferroelectricity and magneto-transport in non-magnetic materials is crucial for exploring magnetoelectric effects and advancing two-dimensional memory and logic applications.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of general grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a central part of microstructure evolution, grain boundary (GB) migration is believed to be both monolithic and unidirectional. But here, we introduce the concept of GB decomposition: one GB separates into two new GBs by controlling the Peach-Koehler forces on its disconnections. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to reveal the disconnection mechanisms and direction-dependent motion behaviors associated with the reversible decomposition of a nickel {\Sigma}7 general GB. We also observed a decomposition-like process in a high-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) dataset of high purity nickel polycrystal (Science 2021, 374, 189-193), and performed HEDM-data-based simulation to confirm it. The decomposition should be considered as a new GB migration behavior, based on its particularity and potential universality.</description>

      <title>Robust Ferroelectricity in Silicon Dioxide upon Intercalation of Ammonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nanoelectronic applications of current ferroelectrics have been greatly impeded by their incompatibility with silicon. In this paper we propose a way to induce ferroelectricity in silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is still the most widely used dielectric material in silicon-based chips. We show first-principles evidence that the intercalation of NH3 molecules into crystalline SiO2 is exothermic, where NH3 molecules form quasi-bonds with SiO2, giving rise to large and robust polarizations. In general, such polarization can be reversed via the reformation of N-Si bondings, which is multiaxial so vertical ferroelectricity may emerge in their thin-films of any facets. When the applied external electric field is large enough, however, the system may exhibit unconventional quantized ferroelectricity of unprecedented magnitude, where NH3 may migrate for multiple lattice constants like mobile ions in ion conductors. Compared with ion conductors with charged mobile ions and ion vacancies that may lead to current leakage, herein the intercalated systems can be denoted as neutral ion conductors where both pristine SiO2 and SiO2 filled with NH3 are insulating. Similar ferroelectricity may exist in various SiO2 crystalline polymorphs, its amorphous phase, and other porous structures intercalated by NH3. Our findings may not only resolve the bottleneck issues for the compatibility of ferroelectrics and silicon, but also develop unconventional mechanisms of ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Adsorbate-induced formation of a surface-polarity-driven nonperiodic superstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical and electronic properties of surfaces and interfaces are important for many technologically relevant processes, be it in information processing, where interfacial electronic properties are crucial for device performance, or in catalytic processes, which depend on the types and densities of active nucleation sites for chemical reactions. Quasi-periodic and nonperiodic crystalline surfaces offer new opportunities because of their inherent inhomogeneity, resulting in localisation and properties vastly different from those of surfaces described by conventional Bravais lattices. Here, we demonstrate the formation of a nonperiodic tiling structure on the surface of the frustrated antiferromagnet PdCrO2 due to hydrogen adsorption. The tiling structure exhibits no long-range periodicity but comprises few-atom hexagonally packed domains covering large terraces. Measurement of the local density of states by tunnelling spectroscopy reveals adsorption-driven modifications to the quasi-2D electronic structure of the surface layer, showing exciting opportunities arising from electron localisation.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of acceptor dopants in monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is a leading ultra-wide band gap semiconductor, but its performance depends on precise control over dopant incorporation and stability. In this work, we use first-principles calculations to systematically assess the diffusion behavior of eight potential deep-level substitutional acceptors (Au, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ni) in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. We consider two key diffusion mechanisms: (i) interstitial diffusion under non-equilibrium conditions relevant to ion implantation, and (ii) trap-limited diffusion (TLD) under near-equilibrium thermal annealing conditions. Our results reveal a strong diffusion anisotropy along the b and c axes, with dopant behavior governed by competition between diffusion and incorporation (or dissociation) activation energies. Under interstitial diffusion, Ca$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ and Mg$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ show the most favorable combination of low migration and incorporation barriers, making them promising candidates for efficient doping along the b and c axes, respectively. In contrast, Au$^{+}_{\text{i}}$ diffuses readily, but exhibits an incorporation barrier that exceeds 5 eV, rendering it ineffective as a dopant. From a thermal stability perspective, Co$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ shows poor activation but high diffusion barriers, which may suppress undesirable migration at elevated temperatures. Under trap-limited diffusion, the dissociation of dopant-host complexes controls mobility. Mg$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ again emerges as a leading candidate, exhibiting the lowest dissociation barriers along both axes, whereas Co$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ and Fe$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ display the highest barriers, suggesting improved dopant retention under thermal stress. Our findings guide dopant selection by balancing activation and thermal stability, essential for robust semi-insulating substrates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Effect and Chern Phases in the 1/5-Depleted Square Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fractional energy spectrum and quantum Hall response of a two-dimensional 1/5-depleted square lattice subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. Using a tight-binding model that includes both nearest-neighbor (t_1) and next-nearest-neighbor (t_2) hopping, we compute the Hofstadter butterfly and extract quantized Hall conductivities via Chern number calculations. In the absence of diagonal hopping (t_2 =0), the spectrum exhibits exact particle-hole and flux-inversion symmetries, and the total Chern number across all bands vanishes. When t_2 is introduced, these symmetries are broken, the butterfly becomes deformed, new gaps open, and -remarkably-a nonzero total Chern sum can emerge, signaling unconventional topological phases. By systematically varying t_1 and t_2, we identify regimes with large individual Chern indices and parameter windows where gap stability and Hall plateaus are optimized. Our results demonstrated that lattice depletion combined with diagonal hopping provides a tunable route to engineer robust Chern insulators in both artificial and oxide-based square-lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Development of an Atomic Layer Deposition System for Deposition of Alumina as a Hydrogen Permeation Barrier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tritium permeation into and through materials poses a critical challenge for the development of nuclear fusion reactors. Minimizing tritium permeation is essential for the safe and efficient use of available fuel supplies. In this work, we present the design, construction, and validation of custom atomic layer deposition (ALD) and deuterium permeation measurement systems aimed at developing thin-film hydrogen permeation barriers. Using the ALD system, we deposited conformal Al2O3 films on copper foil substrates and characterized their growth behavior, morphology, and composition. ALD growth rates of 1.1 angstrom/cycle were achieved for temperatures between 100 degrees C and 210 degrees C. Permeation measurements on bare and ALD-coated copper foils revealed a significant reduction in deuterium flux with the addition of a 10nm Al2O3 layer. While bare copper followed diffusion-limited transport consistent with Sievert's law, the ALD-coated samples exhibited surface-limited, pore-mediated transport with linear pressure dependence. Arrhenius analysis showed distinct differences in activation energy for the two transport regimes, and permeation reduction factors (PRFs) exceeding an order of magnitude were observed. These results demonstrate the potential of ALD-grown Al2O3 films as effective hydrogen isotope barriers and provide a foundation for future studies on film optimization and integration into fusion-relevant components.</description>

      <title>AIMatDesign: Knowledge-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Inverse Materials Design under Data Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design. To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool, accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\% elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.</description>

      <title>A collaborative digital twin built on FAIR data and compute infrastructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine learning models that automatically update as additional data become available. New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be extended to other optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Nine circles of elastic brittle fracture: A series of challenge problems to assess fracture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the turn of the millennium, capitalizing on modern advances in mathematics and computation, a slew of computational models have been proposed in the literature with the objective of describing the nucleation and propagation of fracture in materials subjected to mechanical, thermal, and/or other types of loads. By and large, each new proposal focuses on a particular aspect of the problem, while ignoring others that have been well-established. This approach has resulted in a plethora of models that are, at best, descriptors of fracture only under a restricted set of conditions, while they may predict grossly incorrect and even non-physical behaviors in general. In an attempt to address this predicament, this paper introduces a vetting process in the form of nine challenge problems that any computational model of fracture must convincingly handle if it is to potentially describe fracture nucleation and propagation in general. The focus is on the most basic of settings, that of isotropic elastic brittle materials subjected to quasi-static mechanical loads. The challenge problems have been carefully selected so that: $i$) they can be carried out experimentally with standard testing equipment; $ii$) they can be unambiguously analyzed with a sharp description of fracture; and, most critically, $iii$) in aggregate they span the entire range of well settled experimental knowledge on fracture nucleation and propagation that has been amassed for over a century. For demonstration purposes, after their introduction, each challenge problem is solved with two phase-field models of fracture.</description>

      <title>Homotopy continuation method for solving Dyson equation fully self-consistently: theory and application to NdNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solution of the Dyson equation for the small-gap systems can be plagued by large non-converging iterations. In addition to the convergence issues, due to a high non-linearity, the Dyson equation may have multiple solutions. We apply the homotopy continuation approach to control the behavior of iterations. We used the homotopy continuation to locate multiple fully self-consistent GW solutions for NdNiO2 solid and to establish the corresponding Hartree-Fock limits. Some of the solutions found are qualitatively new and help to understand the nature of electron correlation in this material. We show that there are multiple low-energy charge-transfer solutions leading to a formation of charge-density waves. Our results qualitatively agree with the experimental conductivity measurements. To rationalize the structure of solutions, we compare the k-point occupations and generalize the concept of natural difference orbitals for correlated periodic solids.</description>

Abstract: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) is a critical tool for imaging the properties of materials and biological specimens at atomic scale, yet our understanding of relevant electron beam damage mechanisms is incomplete. Recent studies suggest that certain types of damage can be modelled as a diffusion process. However, numerical simulation of such diffusion processes has remained computationally intensive. This work introduces a high-performance C++ framework for simulating damage diffusion process in STEM that combines efficient numerical computation, advanced visualisations, and multithreading to achieve efficient runtime while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>Origami of Multi-Layered Spaced Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) origami tessellations such as the Miura-ori are often generalized to build three-dimensional (3D) architected materials with sandwich or cellular structures. However, such 3D blocks are densely packed with continuity of the internal material, while for many engineering structures with multi-physical functionality, it is necessary to have thin sheets that are separately spaced and sparsely connected. This work presents a framework for the design and analysis of multi-layered spaced origami, which provides an origami solution for 3D structures where multiple flat sheets are intentionally spaced apart. We connect Miura-ori sheets with sparsely installed thin-sheet parallelogram-like linkages. To explore how this connectivity approach affects the behavior of the origami system, we model the rigid-folding kinematics using analytic trigonometry and rigid-body transformations, and we characterize the elastic-folding mechanics by generalizing a reduced order bar and hinge model for these 3D assemblies. The orientation of the linkages in the multi-layered spaced origami determines which of three folding paths the system will follow including a flat foldable type, a self-locking type, and a double-branch type. When the origami is flat foldable, a maximized packing ratio and a uniform in-plane shear stiffness can be achieved by strategically choosing the link orientation. We show possible applications by demonstrating how the multi-layered spaced origami can be used to build deployable acoustic cloaks and heat shields.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Accelerated Computational Surface-Specific Vibrational Spectroscopy Reveals Oxidation Level of Graphene in Contact with Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise characterization of the graphene/water interface has been hindered by experimental inconsistencies and limited molecular-level access to interfacial structures. In this work, we present a novel integrated computational approach that combines machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles vibrational spectroscopy calculations to reveal how graphene oxidation alters interfacial water structure. Our simulations demonstrate that pristine graphene leaves the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water largely unperturbed, whereas graphene oxide (GO) with surface hydroxyls induces a pronounced $\Delta f \sim 100 cm^{-1}$ redshift of the free-OH vibrational band and a dramatic reduction in its amplitude. These spectral shifts in the computed surface-specific sum-frequency generation spectrum serve as sensitive molecular markers of the GO oxidation level, reconciling previously conflicting experimental observations. By providing a quantitative spectroscopic fingerprint of GO oxidation, our findings have broad implications for catalysis and electrochemistry, where the structuring of interfacial water is critical to performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient GPU-Accelerated Training of a Neuroevolution Potential with Analytical Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) such as neuroevolution potentials (NEP) combine quantum-mechanical accuracy with computational efficiency significantly accelerate atomistic dynamic simulations. Trained by derivative-free optimization, the normal NEP achieves good accuracy, but suffers from inefficiency due to the high-dimensional parameter search. To overcome this problem, we present a gradient-optimized NEP (GNEP) training framework employing explicit analytical gradients and the Adam optimizer. This approach greatly improves training efficiency and convergence speedily while maintaining accuracy and physical interpretability. By applying GNEP to the training of Sb-Te material systems(datasets include crystalline, liquid, and disordered phases), the fitting time has been substantially reduced-often by orders of magnitude-compared to the NEP training framework. The fitted potentials are validated by DFT reference calculations, demonstrating satisfactory agreement in equation of state and radial distribution functions. These results confirm that GNEP retains high predictive accuracy and transferability while considerably improved computational efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Giant Electrostatic Modulation of Ion Permeation in Atomically Small Capillaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the electrostatic double layer and tuning the conductance in nanofluidic systems at salt concentrations of 100 mM or higher has been a persistent challenge. The primary reasons are (i) the short electrostatic proximity length, ~3-10 {\AA}, and (ii) difficulties in fabricating atomically small capillaries. Here, we successfully fabricate in-plane vermiculite laminates with transport heights of ~3-5 {\AA}, which exhibit a cation selectivity close to 1 even at a 1000 mM concentration, suggesting an overlapping electrostatic double layer. For gate voltages from -2 V to +1 V, the K+-intercalated vermiculite shows a remarkable conductivity modulation exceeding 1400% at a 1000 mM KCl concentration. The gated ON/OFF ratio is mostly unaffected by the ion concentration (10-1000 mM), which confirms that the electrostatic double layer overlaps with the collective ion movement within the channel with reduced activation energy. In contrast, vermiculite laminates intercalated with Ca2+ and Al3+ ions display reduced conductance with increasing negative gate voltage, highlighting the importance of ion-specific gating effects under {\AA}-scale confinement. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electrostatic phenomena occurring in highly confined fluidic channels, opening the way to the exploration of the vast library of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Many-particle hybridization of optical transitions from zero-mode Landau levels in HgTe quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present far-infrared magnetospectroscopy measurements of a HgTe quantum well in the inverted band structure regime over the temperature range of 2 to 60 K. The particularly low electron concentration enables us to probe the temperature evolution of all four possible optical transitions originating from zero-mode Landau levels, which are split off from the edges of the electron-like and hole-like bands. By analyzing their resonance energies, we reveal an unambiguous breakdown of the single-particle picture indicating that the explanation of the anticrossing of zero-mode Landau levels in terms of bulk and interface inversion asymmetries is insufficient. Instead, the observed behavior of the optical transitions is well explained by their hybridization driven by electron-electron interaction. We emphasize that our proposed many-particle mechanism is intrinsic to HgTe quantum wells of any crystallographic orientation, including (110) and (111) wells, where bulk and interface inversion asymmetries do not induce the anticrossing of zero-mode Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Windowing in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy: resolving resonances in thin-film samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has become a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of thin films, offering direct access to the complex permittivity in the terahertz range. However, in transmission-based measurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and limited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features such as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing is widely employed to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its application remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for extracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how to apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for truncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window length and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach using representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in which truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different window functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose simple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Our results show that the choice of window parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of extracted material parameters, particularly for sharply resonant systems. This work provides an accessible framework for improving spectral fidelity in THz-TDS of thin-film samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft actuators that respond to external stimuli play a fundamental role in microscale robotics, active matter, and bio-inspired systems. Among these actuators, photo-thermal hybrid microgels (HMGs) containing plasmonic nanoparticles enable rapid, spatially controlled actuation via localized heating. Understanding their dynamic behavior at the single-particle level is crucial for optimizing performance. However, traditional bulk characterization methods such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), provide only ensemble-averaged data, thereby limiting analytical insights. Here, we introduce a dual-laser optical tweezers approach for real-time, single-particle analysis of HMGs under controlled light exposure. Combining direct imaging and mean-square displacement (MSD) analysis, our method quantifies the precise laser power required for actuation and accurately tracks the particle size. We benchmark our results against an existing dual-laser DLS, demonstrating comparable precision while offering the unique advantage of single-actuator resolution. Thus, our method provides as a robust platform for precise optimization of programmable actuators with applications in soft robotics, microswimmers, and biomedical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the discovery of graphene, interest in van der Waals (vdW) materials has surged; yet, advancing "beyond graphene" physics requires the development of quantum material platforms that host versatile many-body states. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 300 mK, we uncover two competing states in vdW metal CeTe3: charge-ordered in-plane antiferromagnetic phases forming stripe and checkerboard patterns. Remarkably, the competition between them is tuned through a modest in-plane magnetic field (approximately 1.5 T), revealing significant cooperative phenomena between frustrated antiferromagnetism, charge order, and competing Fermi surface nesting. Underlying strongly intertwined many-body states are consistently signaled by density of states deformations exceeding plus/minus 30 meV scale across the Fermi level. Our findings provide a promising correlated vdW platform hosting versatile two-dimensional many-body physics, offering a fertile ground to explore topologically nontrivial multi-q charge-ordered antiferromagnetism, quantum criticality, unconventional superconductivity, and their potential interconnections.</description>

Abstract: Novel topological phases of matter are fruitful platforms for the discovery of unconventional electromagnetic phenomena. Higher-fold topology is one example, where the low-energy description goes beyond Standard Model analogs. Despite intensive experimental studies, conclusive evidence remains elusive for the \textit{multi-gap topological nature of higher-fold chiral fermions}. In this Letter, we leverage a combination of fine-tuned chemical engineering and photoemission spectroscopy with photon energy contrast to discover the higher-fold topology of a chiral crystal. We identify all bulk branches of a higher-fold chiral fermion for the first time, critically important for allowing us to explore unique Fermi arc surface states in multiple inter-band gaps, which exhibit an emergent ladder structure. Through designer chemical gating of the samples in combination with our measurements, we uncover an unprecedented multi-gap bulk boundary correspondence. Our demonstration of multi-gap electronic topology will propel future research on unconventional topological responses.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Formulation of the Role of Shear Loads on Multi-Layered Thin Shells and Classification of Their Deformation Modes</title>

Abstract: Shell structures are generally modeled based on kinematic hypotheses, where some of the parameters are preferentially evaluated in a phenomenological manner. In this article, asymptotic analysis against the underlying three-dimensional equation system is considered so as to provide a rational framework for modeling and interpreting the deformation behavior of multi-layered thin shells (MTSs). Capable of accurately predicting both overall stiffness and detailed stress distribution, the proposed shell theory shows its distinguishing features at least in the following aspects. Firstly, it naturally introduces a rule for classifying the deformation modes of MTSs based on the magnitude of the maximum dimensionless principal curvature. Secondly, for each class, the hierarchy in the order of the involved field quantities is examined, and it is shown that when the product of the maximum principal curvature and the characteristic shell size reaches the magnitude of unity or larger, the resulting shell theory cannot be treated by natural extension of plate theories. Lastly, it is demonstrated that, for moderate shear forces and comparable material properties, a leading-order multi-layered shell theory derived from asymptotic analysis should suffice to output satisfactory predictions over the shell stiffness, as well as its internal stress distribution. Numerical examples of the deformation and strength analysis for MTSs are also presented to show the reliability of the leading-order model.</description>

      <title>Native defects and impurities in talcum quasi-2D layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered semiconductors have recently emerged as capable host materials for novel quantum applications ranging from phonics to sensing. Most studies have focused on artificial layered materials, while natural layered materials, such as talc and other silicates, have remained largely unexplored despite their desirable properties, e.g, wide direct bandgap, low concentration of optically active defects, and low abundance of nuclear spins. In this article, we carry out a comprehensive computational study of pristine and defective talc layers and discuss their potential applications. After investigating bulk properties, such as lattice parameters, band structure, and dielectric constant, we study the electronic structure, charge states, spin and optical properties of vacancy defects, metal, metalloid, and non-metallic impurities. Our results establish the basis for identifying color centers, electron paramagnetic resonance centers, potential spin quantum bits, and p and n-type dopants. These findings mature the theory of talc and point toward potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Establishing baselines for generative discovery of inorganic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against four generative techniques based on diffusion models, variational autoencoders, and large language models. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange are better at generating novel materials that are stable, although many of these closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery. By establishing baselines for comparison, this work highlights opportunities for continued advancement of generative models, especially for the targeted generation of novel materials that are thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <title>Invar behavior and negative thermal expansion linked to magnetic transition in dhcp iron hydride under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen incorporation into interstitial sites under high-pressure conditions forms iron hydride with a double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) structure. This phase is stable over a broad pressure-temperature range and exhibits a pressure-induced ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. In this study, we revealed that dhcp iron hydride exhibits the Invar-like behavior and that its thermal expansion becomes negative at elevated pressures by X-ray diffraction. Our findings, supported by DFT+DMFT calculations, demonstrate that these anomalous volume changes are governed by magnetic transitions. Notably, the experimentally determined magnetic volume contribution is an order of magnitude smaller than previous theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>How to choose efficiently the size of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation Hamiltonian for accurate exciton calculations on supercells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is the workhorse method to study excitons in materials. The size of the BSE Hamiltonian, that is how many valence to conduction band transitions are considered in those calculations, needs to be chosen to be sufficiently large to converge excitons' energies and wavefunctions but should be minimized to make calculations tractable, as BSE calculations scale with the number of atoms as $ (N_{\rm{atoms}}^6)$. In particular, in the case of supercell (SC) calculations composed of $N_{\rm{rep}}$ replicas of the primitive cell (PC), a natural choice to build this BSE Hamiltonian is to include all transitions from PC calculations by zone folding. However, this greatly increases the size of the BSE Hamiltonian, as the number of matrix elements in it is $(N_k N_c N_v)^2$, where $N_k$ is the number of $k$-points, and $N_{c(v)}$ is the number of conduction (valence) states. The number of $k$-points decreases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}$ but both the number of conduction and valence states increase by the same factor, therefore the BSE Hamiltonian increases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}^2$, making exactly corresponding calculations prohibitive. Here we provide an analysis to decide how many transitions are necessary to achieve comparable results. With our method, we show that to converge with an energy tolerance of 0.1 eV the first exciton binding energy of a LiF SC composed of 64 PCs, we only need 12\% of the valence to conduction transitions that are given by zone folding. We also show that exciton energies are much harder to converge than Random Phase Approximation transition energies, underscoring the necessity of careful convergence studies. The procedure in our work helps in evaluating excitonic properties in large SC calculations such as defects, self-trapped excitons, polarons, and interfaces.</description>

      <title>Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate (e.g., on a (001)-oriented substrate) that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Effective Mass on ab initio Phonon-limited Electron Mobility of GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive ab initio study of the influence of band structure corrections, particularly the electron effective mass, on the phonon-limited electron drift and Hall mobilities of GaAs. Our approach is based on the DFT+$U$ method, combined with an iterative solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation using the Wannier interpolation technique. We show how this framework allows for accurate refinements of the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion, leading to improved predictions for transport properties. In particular, by varying the Hubbard parameters to purposefully tune the conduction band features, allowing us to reproduce bands with different electron effective mass, we systematically investigate the relationship between mobility and effective mass. In this context, our results show close agreement with semi-empirical relations that follow a power-law dependence. Moreover, this approach can be used to indirectly incorporate temperature effects into the band structure, enabling efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent electron mobilities. Our mobility results exhibit good agreement with experimental data and are comparable to previously reported values obtained using the computationally expensive GW method.</description>

      <title>Photonic obstructed atomic insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological quantum chemistry (TQC) classifies the topological phases by real-space invariants in which obstructed atomic insulators belong to the trivial case but sometimes show the feature of higher-order topological insulator. Here, for a two-dimensional magnetic photonic obstructed atomic insulator, we show that the emergence of corner states is associated with the Wyckoff positions. In such a square lattice with four +$M$ elements and four -$M$ elements, corner states appear when the superlattice exposes $2b$ Wyckoff positions. And the corner states will decrease when the number of exposed $2b$ Wyckoff positions decreases and disappears when $2b$ Wyckoff positions no longer stand at the edge. By arranging all the magnetic rods into one magnetization direction, we find that time-reversal symmetry is not important for corner states. Our finding indicates that the real-space distribution of atoms determines the feature of higher-order topological insulators for obstructed atomic insulators in TQC.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Gate-tunable Capacitance in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ferroelectricity emerging in non-polar graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures has drawn considerable attention because of its fascinating properties and promising high-frequency electrical polarization switching. Yet, the underlying mechanism is still under debate. Here in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBLG) aligned with its neighboring hBN, we observed two types of hysteresis - delayed hysteresis in top gate induced by the anomalous screening, and advanced hysteresis in back gate caused by the anomalous gate-tunable capacitance. To investigate the role played by moir\'e potential in the anomalous hysteresis, we studied a moir\'eless graphene heterostructure as control experiment. Unexpectedly, we observed exactly the same phenomena in this control device. Our findings suggest that the anomalous ferroelectricity in graphene/hBN heterostructures may originate from the dielectric material hBN, calling for further structural investigations on hBN. The observation of gate-tunable capacitance provides more insights in the mysterious ferroelectricity in graphene/hBN heterostructures, and should enable new design of memory devices such as memcapacitor based on tunable capacitance.</description>

      <title>Effect of quenched heterogeneity on creep lifetimes of disordered materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of describing creep in heterogeneous materials by an effective temperature by considering more realistic (and complex) non-mean-field elastic redistribution kernels. We show first, from theoretical considerations, that, if elastic stress redistribution and memory effects are neglected, the average creep failure time follows an Arrhenius expression with an effective temperature explicitly increasing with the quenched heterogeneity. Using a thermally activated progressive damage model of compressive failure, we show that this holds true when taking into account elastic interactions and memory effects, however with an effective temperature $T_{eff}$ depending as well on the nature of the (non-democratic) elastic interaction kernel. We observe that the variability of creep lifetimes, for given external conditions of load and temperature, is roughly proportional to the mean lifetime, therefore depends as well on $T$, on quenched heterogeneity, and the elastic kernel. Finally, we discuss the implications of this effective temperature effect on the interpretation of macroscopic creep tests to estimate an activation volume at the microscale.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Quantum States in Three-Dimensional Twisted Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental idea in wave mechanics is that propagation in a periodic medium can be described by Bloch waves whose conserved crystal momenta define their transformations when displaced by the set of discrete lattice translations. In ordered materials where incommensurate spatial periods compete, this general principle is rendered ineffective, often with dramatic consequences. Examples are crystals with broken symmetries from charge or spin density waves, quasiperiodic lattices that produce diffraction patterns with crystallographically forbidden point symmetries, and stacks of two-dimensional lattices with a relative rotation (twist) between layers. In special cases when there is a small difference between the competing periods, a useful work-around is a continuum description where a periodic long-wavelength field produces Bragg scattering that coherently mixes short-wavelength carrier waves. In this work, we advocate an alternative approach to study three-dimensional twisted crystals that replaces their spectrally congested momentum-space Bloch band structures with a representation using squeezed coherent states in a Fock space of free-particle vortex states. This reorganization of the Hilbert space highlights the crucial role of the Coriolis force in the equations of motion that leads to unconventional phase space dynamics and edge state structure generic to a family of complex crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for generating potential landscapes in GaAs microcavities through focused $He^{+}$ implantation. The ion beam imprints micron-scale patterns of non-radiative centers that deplete the exciton reservoir and form a loss-defined potential minimum. Under non-resonant pumping, the resulting traps have a lateral size $\le 1.2 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a three-dimensional mode volume of only $\approx 0.6 ~ \mathrm{\mu m^3}$, small enough to to support a single polariton condensate mode. The implantation process maintains strong coupling and provides lithographic ($ &lt; 300 ~ \mathrm{nm}$) resolution. These loss-engineered traps effectively overcome the micrometer-scale limitations of conventional microcavity patterning techniques, opening new avenues for device development and polariton research within the quantum regime.</description>
