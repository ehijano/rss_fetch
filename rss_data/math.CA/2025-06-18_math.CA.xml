      <title>Weighted Weak Type estimates for non-integral Square Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide quantitative weighted weak type estimates for non-integral square functions in the critical case $p=2$ in terms of the $A_p$ and reverse H\"older constants associated to the weight. The method of proof uses a decoupling of the role of the weights via a quantitative version of Gehring's lemma. The results can be extended to other $p$ in the range of boundedness of the square function at hand.</description>

      <title>Matrix Weighted $L^p$ Estimates in the Nonhomogeneous Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a modified pointwise convex body domination for vector-valued Haar shifts in the nonhomogeneous setting, strengthening and extending the scalar case developed in arXiv:2309.13943. Moreover, we identify a subclass of shifts, called $L^1$-normalized, for which the standard convex body domination holds without requiring any regularity assumption on the measure. Finally, we extend the best-known matrix weighted $L^p$ estimates for sparse forms to the nonhomogeneous setting. The key difficulty here is the lack of a reverse-H\"older inequality for scalar weights, which was used in arXiv:1710.0339 to establish $L^p$ matrix weighted estimates and only works in the doubling setting. Our approach relies instead on a generalization of the weighted Carleson embedding theorem which allows to control not only a fixed weight, but also collections of weights localized on different dyadic cubes that satisfy a certain compatibility condition.</description>

      <title>Many-faced Painlev\'e I: irregular conformal blocks, topological recursion, and holomorphic anomaly approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the Fourier series (Zak transform) structure of the Painlev\'e I tau function has emerged in multiple contexts. Its main building block admits several conjectural interpretations, such as the partition function of an Argyres-Douglas gauge theory, the topological recursion partition function for the Weierstrass elliptic curve, and a 1-point conformal block on the Riemann sphere with an irregular insertion of rank $\frac52$. We review and further develop a mathematical framework for these constructions, and formulate conjectures on their equivalence. In particular, we give a simple explanation of the Fourier series representation of the tau function based on the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential extended to the space of Stokes data. We provide an algebraic construction of the rank $\frac52$ Whittaker state for the Virasoro algebra embedded into a rank $2$ Whittaker module, prove its existence and uniqueness, and fix its descendant structure. We also prove the conifold gap property of the relevant topological recursion partition function, which, on one hand, enables its efficient computation within the holomorphic anomaly approach and, on the other, establishes the existence of solution for the latter.</description>

      <title>Analytic Schur multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in this paper analytic Schur multipliers on ${\Bbb C}_+^2$ and ${\Bbb D}^2$, i.e. Schur multipliers on ${\Bbb R}^2$ and ${\Bbb T}^2$ that are boundary-value functions of functions analytic in ${\Bbb C}_+^2$ and ${\Bbb D}^2$. Such Schur multipliers are important when studying properties of functions of maximal dissipative operators and contractions under perturbation. We show that if the boundary-value function of a Schur multiplier has certain regularity properties, then it can be represented as an element of the Haagerup tensor product of spaces of analytic functions with similar regularity properties.</description>

      <title>Measure and integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to measure theory, integration and function spaces, with all the needed preliminaries included, and with some applications included as well. We first discuss some basic motivations, coming from discrete probability, that we develop in detail, as a preliminary to general measure theory. Then we discuss measure theory, integration and function spaces, all developed in a standard way, and with emphasis on the explicit computation of various integrals. Finally, we come back to probability, discrete and continuous, with a more advanced discussion, of quantum flavor.</description>

      <title>Approximate solutions to a nonlinear functional differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A functional differential equation related to the logistic equation is studied by a combination of numerical and perturbation methods. Parameter regions are identified where the solution to the nonlinear problem is approximated well by known series solutions of the linear version of the equation. The solution space for a certain class of functions is then mapped out using a continuation approach.</description>

      <title>Critical values for Intermediate and Box dimension of projections and other images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ we investigate for which values of $m$ we have that $\dim_\theta P_V(E)=m$ or $\dim_\theta P_V(E)=\dim_\theta E$ for $\gamma_{d,m}-$almost all $V\in G(d,m)$. Our result can be extended to more general functions that include orthogonal projections and fractional Brownian motion. As a particular case, letting $\theta=1$, the results are valid for the Box dimension.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of Dynamic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow-based methods for sampling and generative modeling use continuous-time dynamical systems to represent a {transport map} that pushes forward a source measure to a target measure. The introduction of a time axis provides considerable design freedom, and a central question is how to exploit this freedom. Though many popular methods seek straight line (i.e., zero acceleration) trajectories, we show here that a specific class of ``curved'' trajectories can significantly improve approximation and learning. In particular, we consider the unit-time interpolation of any given transport map $T$ and seek the schedule $\tau: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ that minimizes the spatial Lipschitz constant of the corresponding velocity field over all times $t \in [0,1]$. This quantity is crucial as it allows for control of the approximation error when the velocity field is learned from data. We show that, for a broad class of source/target measures and transport maps $T$, the \emph{optimal schedule} can be computed in closed form, and that the resulting optimal Lipschitz constant is \emph{exponentially smaller} than that induced by an identity schedule (corresponding to, for instance, the Wasserstein geodesic). Our proof technique relies on the calculus of variations and $\Gamma$-convergence, allowing us to approximate the aforementioned degenerate objective by a family of smooth, tractable problems.</description>

      <title>Fast Convergence for High-Order ODE Solvers in Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. Reformulating this reverse process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) enables efficient sampling using high-order solvers, often requiring only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ steps. Since the score function is typically approximated by a neural network, analyzing the interaction between its regularity, approximation error, and numerical integration error is key to understanding the overall sampling accuracy. In this work, we continue our analysis of the convergence properties of the deterministic sampling methods derived from probability flow ODEs [25], focusing on $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes for any integer $p \geq 1$. Under the assumption that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function are bounded, we develop $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes and demonstrate that the total variation distance between the target distribution and the generated data distribution can be bounded above by \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}} +d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$ denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data dimension and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum step size used in the solver. We numerically verify the regularity assumption on benchmark datasets, confirming that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function remain bounded in practice. Our theoretical guarantees hold for general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules.</description>
