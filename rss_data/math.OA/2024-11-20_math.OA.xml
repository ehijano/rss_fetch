      <title>Convergence of noncommutative spherical averages for actions of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the Bufetov pointwise ergodic theorem for spherical averages of even radius for free group actions on noncommutative $L\log L$-space. Indeed, we extend it to more general Orlicz space $L^\Phi(M, \tau)$ (noncommutative/classical), where $M$ is the semifinite von Neumann algebra with faithful normal semifinite trace $\tau$ and $\Phi: [0, \infty ) $ is a Orlicz function such that $ [0, \infty ) \ni t \rightarrow \left({\Phi(t)}\right)^{ \frac{1}{p}}$ is convex for some $p &gt;1$. To establish this convergence we follow similar approach as Bufetov and Anantharaman-Delaroche. Thus, additionally we obtain Rota theorem on the same noncommutative Orlicz space by extending the earlier work of Anantharaman-Delaroche. Anantharaman-Delaroche proved Rota theorem for noncommutative $L^p$-spaces for $p &gt;1$, and mentioned as ``interesting open problem'' to extend it to noncommutative $L\log L$-space as classical case. In the end we also look at the convergence of averages of spherical averages associated to free group and free semigroup actions on noncommutative spaces.</description>

      <title>Operator Characterization via Projectors and Nilpotents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores operators with countable, continuous, and hybrid spectra, focusing on both finite dimensional and infinite dimensional cases, particularly in non-Hermitian systems. For finite dimensional operators, a novel concept of analogous matrices is introduced. Here, matrices are considered analogous if they share the same projector and nilpotent structures, indicating structural equivalences beyond simple spectral similarities. A graph-based model represents these projector and nilpotent structures, offering insights for classifying analogous matrices. Additionally, the paper calculates the distinct families of analogous matrices by matrix size, establishing a tool for matrix classification.
  The study extends the spectral mapping theorem to multivariate functions of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian matrices, expanding the applicability of spectral theory. This theorem assumes holomorphic functions, enabling its use with a broader class of operators. The finite dimensional framework is further generalized to infinite dimensional cases, covering operators with countable spectra to deepen understanding of operator behavior.
  For continuous spectrum operators, this work generalizes von Neumann's spectral theorem to encompass a wider class of spectral operators, including both self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint cases. This unified approach supports a generalized spectral decomposition, facilitating application of the spectral mapping theorem across various contexts. The concept of analogous operators is also extended to continuous spectrum operators, forming a basis for their classification. Finally, operators with hybrid spectra comprising both discrete and continuous elements are examined, with analogous properties and spectral mapping explored within this context.</description>

      <title>Synchronizing Dynamical Systems: Shift Spaces and $K$-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our previous work, we give a thorough presentation of the techniques developed for synchronizing dynamical systems in the special case of synchronizing shift spaces. Following work of Thomsen, we give a construction of the homoclinic, the heteroclinic, and synchronizing heteroclinic $C^\ast$-algebras along with the synchronizing ideal of a shift space in terms of Bratteli diagrams. The algebras introduced in our previous work (the synchronizing ideal, and synchronizing heteroclinic algebra) are discussed in detail. In the sofic shift case, these algebras are shown to be related to the $C^\ast$-algebras of its minimal left and minimal right presentations. Several specific examples are discussed to demonstrate these techniques. For the even shift we give a complete computation of all the associated invariants. We discuss these algebras for a sofic shift that is not of almost finite type and for a number of strictly non-sofic synchronizing shifts. In particular we discuss the rank of the $K$-theory of the homoclinic algebra of a shift space and its synchronizing ideal and its implications. We also give a construction for producing from any minimal shift a synchronizing shift whose set of non-synchronizing points is exactly the original minimal shift.</description>

      <title>Free Stein Kernel and Moments maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a free analogue to Fathi's construction of Stein kernels using moment maps (2019). This is possible for a class of measures called free moment measures that was introduced in the free case by Bahr and Boschert (2021), and by using the notion of free moment maps which are convex functions, solutions of a variant of the free Monge-Amp\`ere equation discovered by Guionnet and Shlyakhtenko (2012). We then show how regularity estimates in some weighted non-commutative Sobolev spaces on these maps control the transport distances to the semicircular law. We also prove in the one dimensional case a free analogue of the moment map version of the Cafarelli contraction theorem (2001), discovered by Klartag in the classical case (2014), and which leads to a uniform bound on the free moment Stein kernel. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results: we prove a stability result characterizing the semicircular distribution among a certain subclass of free Gibbs measures, the probabilistic interpretation of this free moment Stein kernel in terms of free diffusion processes, its connections with the theory of non-commutative Dirichlet forms, and a possible notion of a non-commutative (free) Hessian manifold associated with a free Gibbs measure, conjecturally having free analogue properties of a classical Hessian manifold associated with a log-concave measure and considered by Kolesnikov (2012), which has the striking property of having a Ricci curvature bounded from below by $1/2$.</description>

      <title>A stronger form of Yamamoto's theorem II -- Spectral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $A \in M_m(\mathbb{C})$, Yamamoto's generalization of the spectral radius formula (1967) asserts that $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_j(A^n)^{\frac{1}{n}}$ is equal to the $j^{\textrm{th}}$-largest eigenvalue-modulus of $A$, where $s_j (A^n)$ denotes the $j^{\textrm{th}}$-largest singular value of $A^n$. Let $\mathscr{H}$ be a complex Hilbert space, and for an operator $T \in \mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$, let $|T| := (T^*T)^{\frac{1}{2}}$. For $A$ in $\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$, we refer to the sequence, $\{ |A^n|^{\frac{1}{n}} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$, as the $\textit{normalized power sequence}$ of $A$. As our main result, we prove a spatial form of Yamamoto's theorem which asserts that the normalized power sequence of a spectral operator in $\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$ converges in norm, and provide an explicit description of the limit in terms of its idempotent-valued spectral resolution. Our approach substantially generalizes the corresponding result by the first-named author in the case of matrices in $M_m(\mathbb{C})$, and supplements the Haagerup-Schultz theorem on SOT-convergence of the normalized power sequence of an operator in a $II_1$ factor.</description>
