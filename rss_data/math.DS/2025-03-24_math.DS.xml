      <title>Measure-expansive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a dynamical system on a measurable metric space {\em measure-expansive} if the probability of two orbits remain close each other for all time is negligible (i.e. zero). We extend results of expansive systems on compact metric spaces to the measure-expansive context. For instance, the measure-expansive homeomorphisms are characterized as those homeomorphisms $f$ for which the diagonal is almost invariant for $f\times f$ with respect to the product measure. In addition, the set of points with converging semi-orbits for such homeomorphisms have measure zero. In particular, the set of periodic orbits for these homeomorphisms is also of measure zero. We also prove that there are no measure-expansive homeomorphisms in the interval and, in the circle, they are the Denjoy ones. As an application we obtain probabilistic proofs of some result of expansive systems. We also present some analogous results for continuous maps.</description>

      <title>Fractal tiles induced by tent maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article we introduce geometrical objects induced by the tent maps associated with special Pisot numbers that we call tent-tiles. They are compact subsets of the one-, two-, or three-dimensional Euclidean space, depending on the particular special Pisot number. Most of the tent-tiles have a fractal shape and we study the Hausdorff dimension of their boundary. Furthermore, we are concerned with tilings induced by tent-tiles. It turns out that tent-tiles give rise to two types of lattice tilings. In order to obtain these results we establish and exploit connections between tent-tiles and Rauzy fractals induced by substitutions and automorphisms of the free group.</description>

      <title>Multifractal formalism of Lyapunov exponents for fiber-bunched linear cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a higher-dimensional extension of multifractal analysis for typical fiber-bunched linear cocycles. Our main result is a relative variational principle, which shows that the topological entropy of the level sets of Lyapunov exponents can be approximated by the metric entropy of ergodic measures fully concentrated on those level sets, addressing a question posed by Breuillard and Sert. We also establish a variational principle for the generalized singular value function. As an application to dynamically defined linear cocycles, we obtain a multifractal formalism for open sets of $C^{1+\alpha}$ repellers and Anosov diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction of dynamical systems on graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems on networks are inherently high-dimensional unless the number of nodes is extremely small. Dimension reduction methods for dynamical systems on networks aim to find a substantially lower-dimensional system that preserves key properties of the original dynamics such as bifurcation structure. A class of such methods proposed in network science research entails finding a one- (or low-) dimensional system that a particular weighted average of the state variables of all nodes in the network approximately obeys. We formulate and mathematically analyze this dimension reduction technique for dynamical systems on dense graphons, or the limiting, infinite-dimensional object of a sequence of graphs with an increasing number of nodes. We first theoretically justify the continuum limit for a nonlinear dynamical system of our interest, and the existence and uniqueness of the solution of graphon dynamical systems. We then derive the reduced one-dimensional system on graphons and prove its convergence properties. Finally, we perform numerical simulations for various graphons and dynamical system models to assess the accuracy of the one-dimensional approximation.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Chaos: From Galactic Dynamics to Plasma Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary focus of this thesis is the numerical investigation of chaos in Hamiltonian models describing charged particle orbits in plasma, star motions in barred galaxies, and orbits' diffusion in multidimensional maps. We systematically explore the interplay between magnetic and kinetic chaos in toroidal fusion plasmas, where non-axisymmetric perturbations disrupt smooth magnetic flux surfaces, generating complex particle trajectories. Using the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method, we efficiently quantify chaos, compare the behavior of magnetic field lines and particle orbits, visualize the radial distribution of chaotic regions, and offer GALI as a valuable tool for studying plasma physics dynamics. We also study the evolution of phase space structures in a 3D barred galactic potential, following successive 2D and 3D pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations of periodic orbits. By employing the `color and rotation' technique to visualize the system's 4D Poincar\'e surface of sections, we reveal distinct structural patterns. We further investigate the long-term diffusion transport and chaos properties of single and coupled standard maps, focusing on parameters inducing anomalous diffusion through accelerator modes exhibiting ballistic transport. Using different ensembles of initial conditions in chaotic regions influenced by these modes, we examine asymptotic diffusion rates and time scales, identifying conditions suppressing anomalous transport and leading to long-term convergence to normal diffusion across coupled maps. Lastly, we perform the first comprehensive investigation into the GALI indices for various attractors in continuous and discrete-time dissipative systems, extending the method's application to non-Hamiltonian systems. A key aspect of our work involves analyzing and comparing GALIs' with Lyapunov Exponents for systems exhibiting hyperchaotic motion.</description>

      <title>Metric mean dimension via subshifts of compact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the metric mean dimension of subshifts of compact type. We prove that the metric mean dimensions of a continuous map and its inverse limit coincide, generalizing Bowen's entropy formula. Building upon this result, we extend the notion of metric mean dimension to discontinuous maps in terms of suitable subshifts. As an application, we show that the metric mean dimension of the Gauss map and that of induced maps of the Manneville-Pomeau family is equal to the box dimension of the corresponding set of discontinuity points, which also coincides with a critical parameter of the pressure operator associated to the geometric potential.</description>

      <title>Differential topology of the spaces of asymptotically stable vector fields and Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of all smooth asymptotically stable vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^n$, as well as the space of all proper smooth Lyapunov functions for such vector fields. We prove that both spaces are path-connected and simply connected when $n\neq 4,5$ and weakly contractible when $n\leq 3$. Moreover, both spaces have the weak homotopy type of the nonlinear Grassmannian of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ diffeomorphic to the $n$-disc.
  The proofs rely on Lyapunov theory and differential topology, such as the work of Smale and Perelman on the generalized Poincar\'{e} conjecture and results of Smale, Cerf, and Hatcher on the topology of diffeomorphism groups of discs. Applications include a partial answer to a question of Conley, a parametric Hartman-Grobman theorem for nonyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria, and a parametric Morse lemma for degenerate minima. We also study the related topics of hyperbolic equilibria, Morse minima, and relative homotopy groups of the space of asymptotically stable vector fields inside the space of those vanishing at a single point.</description>

      <title>Notes on symplectic squeezing in $T^* \mathbb T^n$ and spectra of Finsler dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, on the one hand, we prove that for $n \geq 2$ any subbundle of $T^* \mathbb T^n$ with bounded fibers symplectically embeds into a trivial subbundle of $T^* \mathbb T^n$ where the fiber is an irrational cylinder. This not only resolves an open problem in Gong-Xue's recent work (which was stated for the 4-dimension case, that is, $n =2$) and also generalizes to any higher-dimensional situation. The proof is based on some version of Dirichlet's approximation theorem. On the other hand, we generalize a main result in Gong-Xue's work mentioned above, showing that any topologically trivial Liouville diffeomorphism on $T^*M$ (for instance, a diffeomorphism induced by an isometry on $M$) does not change the full marked length spectrum of a Finsler metric $F$ on $M$, up to a lifting of the Finsler metric $F$ to the unit codisk bundle $D^*_FM$. The proof is based on persistence module theory.</description>

      <title>Word problems and embedding-obstructions in cellular automata groups on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study groups of reversible cellular automata, or CA groups, on groups. More generally, we consider automorphism groups of subshifts of finite type on groups. It is known that word problems of CA groups on virtually nilpotent groups are in co-NP, and can be co-NP-hard. We show that under the Gap Conjecture of Grigorchuk, their word problems are PSPACE-hard on all other groups. On free and surface groups, we show that they are indeed always in PSPACE. On a group with co-NEXPTIME word problem, CA groups themselves have co-NEXPTIME word problem, and on the lamplighter group (which itself has polynomial-time word problem) we show they can be co-NEXPTIME-hard. We show also two nonembeddability results: the group of cellular automata on a non-cyclic free group does not embed in the group of cellular automata on the integers (this solves a question of Barbieri, Carrasco-Vargas and Rivera-Burgos); and the group of cellular automata in dimension $D$ does not embed in a group of cellular automata in dimension $d$ if $D \geq 3d+2$ (this solves a question of Hochman).</description>
