      <title>Inferring Diffusion Structures of Heterogeneous Network Cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network cascade refers to diffusion processes in which outcome changes within part of an interconnected population trigger a sequence of changes across the entire network. These cascades are governed by underlying diffusion networks, which are often latent. Inferring such networks is critical for understanding cascade pathways, uncovering Granger causality of interaction mechanisms among individuals, and enabling tasks such as forecasting or maximizing information propagation. In this project, we propose a novel double mixture directed graph model for inferring multi-layer diffusion networks from cascade data. The proposed model represents cascade pathways as a mixture of diffusion networks across different layers, effectively capturing the strong heterogeneity present in real-world cascades. Additionally, the model imposes layer-specific structural constraints, enabling diffusion networks at different layers to capture complementary cascading patterns at the population level. A key advantage of our model is its convex formulation, which allows us to establish both statistical and computational guarantees for the resulting diffusion network estimates. We conduct extensive simulation studies to demonstrate the model's performance in recovering diverse diffusion structures. Finally, we apply the proposed method to analyze cascades of research topics in the social sciences across U.S. universities, revealing the underlying diffusion networks of research topic propagation among institutions.</description>

      <title>Community Detection in Energy Networks based on Energy Self-Sufficiency and Dynamic Flexibility Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global energy transition towards distributed, smaller-scale resources, such as decentralized generation and flexible assets like storage and shiftable loads, demands novel control structures aligned with the emerging network architectures. These architectures consist of interconnected, self-contained clusters, commonly called microgrids or energy communities. These clusters aim to optimize collective self-sufficiency by prioritizing local energy use or operating independently during wide-area blackouts. This study addresses the challenge of defining optimal clusters, framed as a community detection problem. A novel metric, termed energy modularity, is proposed to evaluate community partitions by quantifying energy self-sufficiency within clusters while incorporating the influence of flexible resources. Furthermore, a highly scalable community detection algorithm to maximize energy modularity based on the Louvain method is presented. Therefore, energy modularity is calculated using linear programming or a more efficient simulation-based approach. The algorithm is validated on an exemplary benchmark grid, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying optimal energy clusters for modern decentralized energy systems.</description>

      <title>Expanders in Models of Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common model for social networks are Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs), in which vertices draw a random position in some latent geometric space, and the probability of two vertices forming an edge depends on their geometric distance. The geometry may be modelled in two ways: either two points are defined as close if they are similar in all dimensions, or they are defined as close if they are similar in some dimensions. The first option is mathematically more natural since it can be described by metrics. However, the second option is arguably the better model for social networks if the different dimensions represent features like profession, kinship, or interests. In such cases, nodes already form bonds if they align in some, but not all dimensions. For the first option, it is known that the resulting networks are poor expanders. We study the second option in the form of Minimum-Component Distance GIRGs, and find that those behave the opposite way for dimension $d\ge 2$, and that they have strong expanding properties. More precisely, for a suitable constant $C&gt;0$, the subgraph induced by vertices of (expected) degree at least $(\log n)^C$ forms an expander. Moreover, we study how the expansion factor of the resulting subgraph depends on the choice of $C$, and show that this expansion factor is $\omega(1)$ except for sets that already take up a constant fraction of the vertices. This has far-reaching consequences, since many algorithms and mixing processes are fast on expander graphs.</description>

      <title>Properties and Expressivity of Linear Geometric Centralities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centrality indices are used to rank the nodes of a graph by importance: this is a common need in many concrete situations (social networks, citation networks, web graphs, for instance) and it was discussed many times in sociology, psychology, mathematics and computer science, giving rise to a whole zoo of definitions of centrality. Although they differ widely in nature, many centrality measures are based on shortest-path distances: such centralities are often referred to as geometric. Geometric centralities can use the shortest-path-length information in many different ways, but most of the existing geometric centralities can be defined as a linear transformation of the distance-count vector (that is, the vector containing, for every index t, the number of nodes at distance t).
  In this paper we study this class of centralities, that we call linear (geometric) centralities, in their full generality. In particular, we look at them in the light of the axiomatic approach, and we study their expressivity: we show to what extent linear centralities can be used to distinguish between nodes in a graph, and how many different rankings of nodes can be induced by linear centralities on a given graph. The latter problem (which has a number of possible applications, especially in an adversarial setting) is solved by means of a linear programming formulation, which is based on Farkas' lemma, and is interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>Signal Use and Emergent Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes, learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture - Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.</description>

      <title>Social Hatred: Efficient Multimodal Detection of Hatemongers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances, we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging. In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and over large datasets and networks.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Graph Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO) interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP &amp; OLAP workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and eventually consistent systems.</description>

      <title>Words as Trigger Points in Social Media Discussions: A Large-Scale Case Study about UK Politics on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Political debates on social media sometimes flare up. From that moment on, users engage much more with one another; their communication is also more emotional and polarised. While it has been difficult to grasp such moments with computational methods, we suggest that trigger points are a useful concept to understand and ultimately model such behaviour. Established in qualitative focus group interviews to understand political polarisation (Mau, Lux, and Westheuser 2023), trigger points represent moments when individuals feel that their understanding of what is fair, normal, or appropriate in society is questioned. In the original studies, individuals show strong and negative emotional responses when certain triggering words or topics are mentioned. Our paper finds that these trigger points also exist in online debates. We examine online deliberations on Reddit between 2020 and 2022 and collect &gt;100 million comments from subreddits related to a set of words identified as trigger points in UK politics. Analysing the comments, we find that trigger words increase user engagement and animosity, i.e., more negativity, hate speech, and controversial comments. Introducing trigger points to computational studies of online communication, our findings are relevant to researchers interested in affective computing, online deliberation, and how citizens debate politics and society in light of affective polarisation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating link prediction: New perspectives and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Link prediction (LP) is an important problem in network science and machine learning research. The state-of-the-art LP methods are usually evaluated in a uniform setup, ignoring several factors associated with the data and application specific needs. We identify a number of such factors, such as, network-type, problem-type, geodesic distance between the end nodes and its distribution over the classes, nature and applicability of LP methods, class imbalance and its impact on early retrieval, evaluation metric, etc., and present an experimental setup which allows us to evaluate LP methods in a rigorous and controlled manner. We perform extensive experiments with a variety of LP methods over real network datasets in this controlled setup, and gather valuable insights on the interactions of these factors with the performance of LP through an array of carefully designed hypotheses. Following the insights, we provide recommendations to be followed as best practice for evaluating LP methods.</description>
