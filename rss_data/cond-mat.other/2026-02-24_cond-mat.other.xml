      <title>Anisotropic magnetoresistance and magnetic field-tunable Weyl nodes in Weyl metal SrRuO$_{3}$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals are a unique class of topological materials, possessing Fermi-arc surface states and exhibiting the chiral anomaly effect. The chiral anomaly refers to non-equilibrium charge transfer within a Weyl-node pair of opposite chirality under the condition of aligned electric and magnetic fields ($\bf{E} \parallel \bf{B}$), leading to non-conserved chiral charges and thus enhanced electrical conductivity. In experiments, such an enhanced conductivity due to the chiral anomaly manifests as a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) when the external field $\bf{H}$ is applied along the bias current direction $\bf{I}$. In this work, we present rigorous $\phi$- and $\alpha$-dependent magnetotransport measurements to investigate such a negative longitudinal MR due to the chiral anomaly in a sunbeam-shaped device fabricated from an untwinned Weyl metal SrRuO$_{3}$ (SRO) thin film. Here, $\phi$($\alpha$) represents the angle between $\bf{I}$ and the in-plane $\bf{H}$(SRO monoclinic [001]$_{\rm o}$). Unusual $\phi$ dependences of in-plane MR and Hall effects were uncovered at low temperatures, accompanied by the emergence of the fourfold-symmetric component in the in-plane MR. These results indicate that the chiral anomaly and resistivity anisotropy in SRO play important roles. In particular, the dramatic variation of Weyl nodes near the Fermi level through magnetic field manipulation of the magnetization orientation, as revealed by band structure calculations, is consistent with the observed in-plane MR and Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Bridging atomic and mesoscopic length scales with Replica Scanning Tunneling Microscopy: Visualizing the intra-unit cell pair density modulation of superconducting FeSe at micron length scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a cornerstone technique for visualizing the electronic density of states with atomic resolution (typically below 0.1 nm). While the field of view of most STM setups extends up to a few microns, obtaining atomic resolution over these large areas is often impractical and excessively time-consuming. This is due to the need to acquire maps with a point number reaching 107 or more with a full current or conductance vs voltage curve at each point. The standard procedure is to make large scale maps and then select small regions to zoom-in for high-resolution atomic scale analysis. However, this approach fails to address a question which is often critical: Does a specific atomic-scale modulation of the electronic density of states persist over much larger, mesoscopic length scales? Here we present a new method: Replica STM (R-STM), that overcomes this limitation, allowing the study of atomic-scale phenomena up to micron length scales. We obtained new large-area STM tunneling conductance maps in UTe2 and FeSe, spanning areas over 200 nm in size. In these large scale maps we discovered signals with wavelengths significantly exceeding interatomic distances. We show that these large-wavelength signals are replicas of the underlying atomic-scale density of states modulations. R-STM leverages these replica signals to efficiently track atomic-scale features over large areas. Using this novel technique, we show that the pair density modulation discovered recently in FeSe persists with the same characteristic wavelength up to hundreds of nm length scales. R-STM provides a powerful and practical new capability for STM to compare atomic scale with micrometer scale phenomena. The proof of principle of R-STM can be extended to any other scanning probe microscopy experiment where a periodic signal is traced as a function of position.</description>

      <title>Bismuth-substituted Lutetium Iron Garnet Films with Giant Visible-Range Magneto-Optical Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-optical materials are indispensable across modern physics, serving as the foundation for precision magnetic sensing, nonreciprocal photonics, and optical isolation technologies. The continual pursuit of materials with high Verdet constants has driven the development of garnet-based compounds exhibiting extreme magneto-optical sensitivity. In this work, we report the growth and comprehensive magneto-optical characterization of bismuth-substituted lutetium iron garnet (LuBiIG), a material that combines the large spin-orbit coupling of bismuth with the lattice stability of lutetium iron garnet. The films exhibit an exceptionally high Verdet constant of up to -0.120 deg/um/mT, peaking in the visible spectral range near 520nm. LuBiIG films with thicknesses between 80 and 220nm were grown by pulsed laser deposition and characterized at room temperature over the 500-820nm wavelength range. These results position LuBiIG as a highly sensitive magneto-optical material suitable for advanced cryogenic detection and hybrid quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Selective decoupling in multi-level quantum systems by the SU(2) sign anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical decoupling operated by $2\pi$-pulses in a two-level subspaces of a multilevel system showing that it may leads to selective decoupling. This provides a flexible strategy for decoupling transitions in a quantum network, when control to directly address them is not available which can be use to control internode interaction or actively suppress decoherence</description>

      <title>Random purification channel made simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of any mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of $n$ i.i.d. copies of its purifications, has proved to be an extremely useful tool in quantum learning theory. Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.</description>
