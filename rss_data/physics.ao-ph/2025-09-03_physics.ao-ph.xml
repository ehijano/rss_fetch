      <title>DiffTopo: Solver in the Loop for Inverse Topography via Condition Diffusion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring seabed topography from wave height observations is fundamental to tsunami hazard assessment, coastal planning, and large scale ocean circulation modeling. Classical inversion models typically rely on direct sensing or optimization based schemes that must contend with the strongly nonlinear coupling between free surface dynamics and topography. However, data driven approaches are capable of tackling strongly nonlinear problems by learning the underlying data distributions. This study introduces DiffTopo, a conditional diffusion model that reconstructs topography from surface wave field data governed by shallow water equations. Leveraging classifier free guidance, DiffTopo not only generates a series of solutions but also applies a thresholding mechanism that ensures, via the solver, the validation results are physically plausible. This study evaluates both observed wave fields and three distinct topography configurations, demonstrating that DiffTopo exhibits robust generalization and remains consistent with the shallow water equations even under full observations. These results underscore the potential of diffusion based generative modeling for addressing ill posed inverse problems in geophysics.</description>

      <title>CERA: A Framework for Improved Generalization of Machine Learning Models to Changed Climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust generalization under climate change remains a major challenge for machine learning applications in climate science. Most existing approaches struggle to extrapolate beyond the climate they were trained on, leading to a strong dependence on training data from model simulations of warm climates. Use of climate-invariant inputs improves generalization but requires challenging manual feature engineering. Here, we present CERA (Climate-invariant Encoding through Representation Alignment), a machine learning framework consisting of an autoencoder with explicit latent-space alignment, followed by a predictor for downstream process estimation. We test CERA on the problem of parameterizing moist-physics processes. Without training on labeled data from a +4K climate, CERA leverages labeled control-climate data and unlabeled warmer-climate inputs to improve generalization to the warmer climate, outperforming both raw-input and physically informed baselines in predicting key moisture and energy tendencies. It captures not only the vertical and meridional structures of the moisture tendencies, but also shifts in the intensity distribution of precipitation including extremes. Ablation experiments show that latent alignment improves both accuracy and the robustness across random seeds used in training. While some reduced skill remains in the boundary layer, the framework offers a data-driven alternative to manual feature engineering of climate invariant inputs. Beyond parameterizations used in hybrid ML-physics systems, the approach holds promise for other climate applications such as statistical downscaling.</description>

      <title>MedFormer: a data-driven model for forecasting the Mediterranean Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting is essential for supporting a wide range of marine applications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the potential of data-driven models to outperform traditional numerical approaches, particularly in atmospheric weather forecasting. However, extending these methods to ocean systems remains challenging due to their inherently slower dynamics and complex boundary conditions. In this work, we present MedFormer, a fully data-driven deep learning model specifically designed for medium-range ocean forecasting in the Mediterranean Sea. MedFormer is based on a U-Net architecture augmented with 3D attention mechanisms and operates at a high horizontal resolution of 1/24{\deg}. The model is trained on 20 years of daily ocean reanalysis data and fine-tuned with high-resolution operational analyses. It generates 9-day forecasts using an autoregressive strategy. The model leverages both historical ocean states and atmospheric forcings, making it well-suited for operational use. We benchmark MedFormer against the state-of-the-art Mediterranean Forecasting System (MedFS), developed at Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC), using both analysis data and independent observations. The forecast skills, evaluated with the Root Mean Squared Difference and the Anomaly Correlation Coefficient, indicate that MedFormer consistently outperforms MedFS across key 3D ocean variables. These findings underscore the potential of data-driven approaches like MedFormer to complement, or even surpass, traditional numerical ocean forecasting systems in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Operational High-Resolution Nowcasting in Switzerland Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural weather forecasting have shown significant potential for accurate short-term forecasts. However, adapting such gridded approaches to smaller, topographically complex regions like Switzerland introduces computational challenges, especially when aiming for high spatial (1 km) and temporal (10 minutes) resolution. This paper presents a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for high-resolution nowcasting in Switzerland using the Anemoi framework and observational inputs. The proposed model combines surface observations with selected past and future numerical weather prediction (NWP) states, enabling an observation-guided interpolation strategy that enhances short-term accuracy while preserving physical consistency. We evaluate the method on multiple surface variables and compare it against operational high-resolution NWP (ICON) and nowcasting (INCA) baselines. The results show that the GNN model consistently outperforms traditional approaches in lead times up to 12 hours, especially for wind and precipitation. A comprehensive verification procedure, including spatial skill scores, event-based evaluation, and blind tests with professional forecasters, demonstrates the operational relevance of the approach for mountainous domains.</description>

      <title>Towards a Climate OSSE Framework for Satellite Mission Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rich history of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) does not yet include a well-established framework for using climate models. The need for a climate OSSE is triggered by the need to quantify the value of a particular measurement for reducing the uncertainty in climate predictions, which differ from numerical weather predictions in that they depend on future atmospheric composition rather than the current state of the weather. However, both weather and climate modeling communities share a need for motivating major observing system investments. Here we outline a new framework for climate OSSEs that leverages the use of machine-learning to calibrate climate model physics against existing satellite data. We demonstrate its application using NASA's GISS-E3 model to objectively quantify the value of potential future improvements in spaceborne measurements of Earth's planetary boundary layer. A mature climate OSSE framework should be able to quantitatively compare the ability of proposed observing system architectures to answer a climate-related question, thus offering added value throughout the mission design process, which is subject to increasingly rapid advances in instrument and satellite technology. Technical considerations include selection of observational benchmarks and climate projection metrics, approaches to pinpoint the sources of model physics uncertainty that dominate uncertainty in projections, and the use of instrument simulators. Community and policy-making considerations include the potential to interface with an established culture of model intercomparison projects and a growing need to economically assess the value-driven efficiency of social spending on Earth observations.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Physics Eulerian Framework for Long-Term Contrail Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensation trails (contrails) are increasingly recognized as a major contributor to aviation-induced atmospheric warming, rivaling the impact of carbon dioxide. Mitigating their climate effects requires accurate and computationally efficient models to inform avoidance strategies. Contrails evolve through distinct stages, from formation and rapid growth to dissipation or transition into cirrus clouds, where the latter phase critically determines their radiative forcing. This long-term evolution is primarily driven by advection-diffusion processes coupled with ice-particle growth dynamics. We propose a new multi-physics Eulerian framework for long-term contrail simulations, integrating underexplored or previously neglected factors, including spatiotemporal wind variability; nonlinear diffusion coefficients accounting for potential diffusion-blocking mechanisms; a novel multiphase theoretical model for the bulk settling velocity of ice particles; and ice-crystal habit dynamics. The Eulerian model is solved using a recently proposed discretization approach to enhance both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, the Eulerian model introduces several theoretical, adjustable parameters that can be calibrated using ground-truth data to optimize the built-in nonlinear advection-diffusion equations (ADEs). We further demonstrate that the governing nonlinear ADEs admit dimensional separability under suitable assumptions, making the multi-physics Eulerian model particularly promising for large-scale simulations of contrail plumes and, ultimately, their associated radiative forcing.</description>

      <title>Imputing Missing Long-Term Spatiotemporal Multivariate Atmospheric Data with CNN-Transformer Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous physical domains are important for scientific investigations of dynamical processes in the atmosphere. However, missing data arising from operational constraints and adverse environmental conditions pose significant challenges to accurate analysis and modeling. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Transformer machine learning model for multivariable atmospheric data imputation, termed CT-MVP. This framework integrates CNNs for local feature extraction with transformers for capturing long-range dependencies across time and altitude. The model is trained and evaluated on a testbed using the Specified Dynamics Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (SD-WACCM-X) dataset spanning 13 years, which provides continuous global coverage of atmospheric variables, including temperature and zonal and meridional winds. This setup ensures that the ML approach can be rigorously assessed under diverse data-gap conditions. The hybrid framework enables effective reconstruction of missing values in high-dimensional atmospheric datasets, with comparative evaluations against traditional methods and a simple transformer. The results demonstrate that CT-MVP achieves superior performance compared with traditional approaches, particularly in cases involving extended periods of missing data, and slightly outperforms a simple transformer with the same hyper-parameters.</description>

      <title>An Observations-focused Assessment of Global AI Weather Prediction Models During the South Asian Monsoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seven state-of-the-art AI weather models (FourCastNet, FourCastNet-SFNO, Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, Aurora, AIFS, and GenCast) are evaluated against observational data during the South Asian Monsoon. The models are tested on temperature, winds, global kinetic energy spectrum, regional precipitation, cloud cover, cyclone trajectory prediction, and hyperlocal predictions around extreme weather events. The models forecast large-scale dynamics with reasonable accuracy, but fall short on key metrics critical to Monsoon-time weather prediction. The models exhibit substantially higher errors when compared against ground-based weather station data than against reanalysis or conventional forecasts. The AI weather prediction models show key differences in mesoscale kinetic energy and extreme precipitation during the Monsoon, and predict markedly different Monsoon-time cyclone trajectories over the Indian subcontinent, raising questions about their readiness for operational applications. Our analysis finds that ECMWF's deterministic AIFS model offers the most reliable performance and usability, with GraphCast and GenCast being close seconds.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Ionosphere from Sparse GNSS Data with Temporal-Fusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations, but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.</description>

      <title>IndiaWeatherBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Data-Driven Regional Weather Forecasting over India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent. IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks, as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives. While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at https://github.com/tung-nd/IndiaWeatherBench.</description>

      <title>AT Loss: Advanced Torrential Loss Function for Precipitation Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold, rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential (AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the operational model.</description>

      <title>Wave erosion of ice cliffs: melt rate due to reflection of non-breaking surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave erosion of ice cliffs is one of the main mechanisms for waterline ice melt for icebergs, glacier fronts, and ice-shelf fronts. Despite its importance, this process is fundamentally not well understood or extensively tested in controlled experiments, and therefore coarsely parameterized in geophysical and climate models. In this study, we examine the melting of a vertical ice wall caused by surface waves using both theory and laboratory experiments, with an emphasis on the flow-induced heat transport in the theory and measurements of the melt rate profile under different wave conditions in the experiments. In both the theory and the experiments, we find that there is enhanced melting near the surface that decays with depth. Via an analysis the oscillatory boundary layer flow, we find that an approximate, leading-order, wave-averaged balance of heat transport is given by the vertical advection due to an Eulerian boundary layer streaming current and horizontal diffusion. By solving for this balance and obtaining the wave-averaged temperature field, we find an explicit expression for the wave-induced melt rate. Experimental data show a good match to this expression, especially for larger wave amplitudes and colder water temperatures, though we find that the ambient melt can be a significant contributor to the waterline melt rate.</description>

      <title>LUCIE-3D: A three-dimensional climate emulator for forced responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals, including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2 concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes, while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient, training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability, physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and future Earth system emulation.</description>

      <title>Global Climate Model Bias Correction Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19145</link>

Abstract: Climate change affects ocean temperature, salinity and sea level, impacting monsoons and ocean productivity. Future projections by Global Climate Models based on shared socioeconomic pathways from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are widely used to understand the effects of climate change. However, CMIP models have significant bias compared to reanalysis in the Bay of Bengal for the time period when both projections and reanalysis are available. For example, there is a 1.5C root mean square error (RMSE) in the sea surface temperature (SST) projections of the climate model CNRM-CM6 compared to the Ocean Reanalysis System (ORAS5). We develop a suite of data-driven deep learning models for bias correction of climate model projections and apply it to correct SST projections of the Bay of Bengal. We propose the use of three different deep neural network architectures: convolutional encoder-decoder UNet, Bidirectional LSTM and ConvLSTM. We also use a baseline linear regression model and the Equi-Distant Cumulative Density Function (EDCDF) bias correction method for comparison and evaluating the impact of the new deep learning models. All bias correction models are trained using pairs of monthly CMIP6 projections and the corresponding month's ORAS5 as input and output. Historical data (1950-2014) and future projection data (2015-2020) of CNRM-CM6 are used for training and validation, including hyperparameter tuning. Testing is performed on future projection data from 2021 to 2024. Detailed analysis of the three deep neural models has been completed. We found that the UNet architecture trained using a climatology-removed CNRM-CM6 projection as input and climatology-removed ORAS5 as output gives the best bias-corrected projections. Our novel deep learning-based method for correcting CNRM-CM6 data has a 15% reduction in RMSE compared EDCDF.</description>

      <title>Are Hourly PM2.5 Forecasts Sufficiently Accurate to Plan Your Day? Individual Decision Making in the Face of Increasing Wildfire Smoke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wildfire frequency is increasing as the climate changes, and the resulting air pollution poses health risks. Just as people routinely use hourly weather forecasts to plan their day's activities around precipitation, reliable hourly air quality forecasts could help individuals reduce their exposure to air pollution. In the present work, we evaluate six existing forecasts of ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) within the continental United States during the 2023 fire season. We include forecasts using physical simulation, ensembling, and artificial intelligence. We focus our evaluation on individual decisions, such as (1) whether to go outside on a day with potentially high PM2.5 or (2) when to go outside for the lowest PM2.5 exposure. Our evaluation consists of both visualizations of hourly PM2.5 forecasts in particular locations as well as metrics summarizing forecast skill for the two tasks above. As part of our analysis, we introduce a new evaluation metric for the task of deciding when to go outside. We find meaningful room for improvement in PM2.5 forecasting, which might be realized by improving physical models, incorporating more data sources, and using artificial intelligence tools.</description>

      <title>ORBIT-2: Scaling Exascale Vision Foundation Models for Weather and Climate Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling. However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 65,536 GPUs, achieving up to 4.1 exaFLOPS sustained throughput and 74--98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with $R^2$ scores in the range of 0.98--0.99 against observational data.</description>
