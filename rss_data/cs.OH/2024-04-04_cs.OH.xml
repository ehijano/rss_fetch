      <title>Trainable Least Squares to Reduce PAPR in OFDM-based Hybrid Beamforming Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a trainable least squares (LS) approach for reducing the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals in a hybrid beamforming (HBF) system. Compared to digital beamforming (DBF), in HBF technology the number of antennas exceeds the number of digital ports. Therefore, PAPR reduction capabilities are restricted by both a limited bandwidth and the reduced size of digital space. The problem is to meet both conditions. Moreover, the major HBF advantage is a reduced system complexity, thus the complexity of the PAPR reduction algorithm is expected to be low. To justify the performance of the proposed trainable LS, we provide a performance bound achieved by convex optimization using the CVX Matlab package. Moreover, the complexity of the proposed algorithm can be comparable to the minimal complexity of the digital ``twin'' calculation in HBF. The abovementioned features prove the feasibility of the trained LS for PAPR reduction in fully-connected HBF.</description>

      <title>Virtual Sectorization to Enable Hybrid Beamforming in mm-Wave mMIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid beamforming (HBF) is a key technology to enable mm-wave Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) receivers for future-generation wireless communications. It combines beamforming in both analog (via phase shifters) and digital domains, resulting in low power consumption and high spectral efficiency. In practice, the problem of joint beamforming in multi-user scenarios is still open because an analog beam can't cover all users simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach to divide users into clusters. Each cluster consists of users inside a virtual sector produced by the analog beamforming of an HBF-based mMIMO receiver. Thus, inside each sector, a lower-cost digital beamforming serves a limited number of users within the same cluster. Simulations with realistic non-line-of-sight scenarios generated by the QuaDRiGa 2.0 demonstrate that our methods outperform standard FFT-based alternatives and almost achieve SVD-based beamspace performance bound.</description>

      <title>LoS Sensing-based Channel Estimation in UAV-Assisted OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the potential advantage of the line-of-sight (LoS) path, characterized by its high probability of existence, has not been fully harnessed, thereby impeding the improvement of channel estimation (CE) accuracy. Inspired by the ideas of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), this letter develops a LoS sensing method aimed at detecting the presence of LoS path. Leveraging the prior information obtained from LoS path detection, the detection thresholds for resolvable paths are proposed for LoS and Non-LoS (NLoS) scenarios, respectively. By employing these specifically designed detection thresholds, denoising processing is applied to classical least square (LS) CE, thereby improving the CE accuracy. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing CE accuracy and demonstrate its robustness against parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Towards a Cloud-based Smart Office Solution for Shared Workplace Individualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of workplace dynamics, the shift towards hybrid working models has highlighted inefficiencies in the use of traditional office space and the need for an improved employee experience. In this position paper we propose a Smart Office solution that addresses these challenges by integrating a microservice architecture with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to provide a flexible, personalized workspace environment. The position paper focuses on the technical implementation of this solution, including the design of a Workplace Environment Index (WEI) to monitor and improve office conditions. By using cloud technology, IoT devices with sensors, and following a user-centred design, the proposed solution shows how Shared Open Workspaces can be transformed into adaptive, efficient environments that support the diverse needs of the modern workforce. This position paper paves the way for future experimentation in real-world office environments to validate the effectiveness of the Smart Office solution and provide insights into its potential to redefine the workplace for improved productivity and employee satisfaction.</description>
