      <title>Towards NoahMP-AI: Enhancing Land Surface Model Prediction with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate soil moisture prediction during extreme events remains a critical challenge for Earth system modeling, with profound implications for drought monitoring, flood forecasting, and climate adaptation strategies. While land surface models (LSMs) provide physically-based predictions, they exhibit systematic biases during extreme conditions when their parameterizations operate outside calibrated ranges. Here we present NoahMP-AI, a physics-guided deep learning framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging the complete Noah-MP land surface model as a comprehensive physics-based feature generator while using machine learning to correct systematic biases against satellite observations. We employ a 3D U-Net architecture that processes Noah-MP outputs (soil moisture, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux) to predict SMAP-validated soil moisture across two contrasting extreme events: a prolonged drought (March-September 2022) and Hurricane Beryl (July 2024) over Texas. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over standalone Noah-MP predictions, with R-squared values improving from -0.57 to 0.46 during drought conditions, while maintaining physical consistency and spatial coherence. The framework's ability to preserve Noah-MP's physical relationships while learning observation-based corrections represents a significant advance in hybrid Earth system modeling. This work establishes both a practical tool for operational forecasting and a benchmark for investigating the optimal integration of physics-based understanding with data-driven learning in environmental prediction systems.</description>

      <title>Updated line list for the principal isotopologue of carbon monoxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The line list for the principal isotopologue of CO calculated earlier by the present authors [1, 2] with the irregular dipole-moment function (DMF) is updated with use of the recent high-precision measurements in the 3-0 [3, 4] (Bielska et al. 2022, Hodges et al. 2025) and 7-0 [5] (Balashov et al. 2023) bands. The new data came in contradiction with the experimental data on the 1-0 band [6, 7]. Therefore, we performed fitting several model DMFs to the modified original data set of Meshkov et al. [8] by including the new above-referenced data and by excluding the data for the 1-0 band. The updated line list is calculated with the irregular DMF. In particular, excellent agreement with recent high-level ab initio calculations on the 3-0 band [3] is emphasized and predictions for the 1-0 and 8-0 bands are outlined. In the new update of the HITRAN database [9], new high-precision measurements in the cold and hot fundamental bands are announced. When these data are published, they will be compared with the predictions of our new line list.</description>

      <title>Observed circulation trends in boreal summer linked to two spatially distinct teleconnection patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various regions in the Northern Hemispheric midlatitudes have seen pronounced trends in upper-atmosphere summer circulation and surface temperature extremes over recent decades (since 1979). Several of these regional trends lie outside the range of historic CMIP6 model simulations, and they might constitute a joined dynamic response that is missed by climate models. Here, we examine if the regional trends in circulation are indeed part of a coherent circumglobal wave pattern. Using ERA5 reanalysis data and CMIP6 historical simulations, we find that the observed upper-atmospheric circulation trends consist of at least two separate regional signatures: a US-Atlantic and a Eurasian trend pattern. The circulation trend can explain on average 15% and 26% of the observed regional temperature trends in the US-Atlantic and Eurasian regions respectively. The circulation trend in the CMIP6 multi-model-mean does not resemble the observed trend pattern and is much weaker overall. Some individual CMIP6 models do show a resemblance to the observed pattern in ERA5, although still weak with a maximum pattern correlation of 0.47. The pattern correlation is higher for the two individual regions (US-Atlantic and Eurasia), reaching a maximum of 0.69 and 0.78. We show that both regional wave patterns in ERA5 are associated with distinct sea surface temperature and outgoing longwave radiation anomalies in the three weeks leading up to the atmospheric configuration, resembling known teleconnection patterns. CMIP6 models appear to lack these tropical-extra-tropical teleconnections. Our findings highlight the limitations of CMIP6 models in reproducing teleconnections and their associated regional imprint, creating deep uncertainty for regional climate projections on decadal to multi-decadal timescales.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Influence of Climate on Storm Activity Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extratropical storms shape midlatitude weather and vary due to the slowly evolving climate and the rapid changes in synoptic conditions. While the influence of each factor has been studied extensively, their relative importance remains unclear. Here, we quantify the climate's relative importance in mean storm activity and individual storm development using 84 years of ERA-5 data and convolutional neural networks. We find that the constructed model predicts over 90% of the variability in the mean storm activity. However, a similar model predicts about a third of the variability in individual storm properties, such as maximum intensity, showing their variability is dominated by synoptic conditions. Isolating the impact of present-day climate change on individual storms shows it contributes to about 0.1% for storm-intensity variability, whereas its contribution to storms' heat-anomaly variability is over three times greater, highlighting that focusing on variables directly tied to global warming offers a clearer attribution pathway.</description>
