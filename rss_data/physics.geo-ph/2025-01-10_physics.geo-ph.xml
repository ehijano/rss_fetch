      <title>Geophysical inverse problems with measurement-guided diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving inverse problems with the reverse process of a diffusion model represents an appealing avenue to produce highly realistic, yet diverse solutions from incomplete and possibly noisy measurements, ultimately enabling uncertainty quantification at scale. However, because of the intractable nature of the score function of the likelihood term (i.e., $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} p(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}_t)$), various samplers have been proposed in the literature that use different (more or less accurate) approximations of such a gradient to guide the diffusion process towards solutions that match the observations. In this work, I consider two sampling algorithms recently proposed under the name of Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Pseudo-inverse Guided Diffusion Model (PGDM), respectively. In DSP, the guidance term used at each step of the reverse diffusion process is obtained by applying the adjoint of the modeling operator to the residual obtained from a one-step denoising estimate of the solution. On the other hand, PGDM utilizes a pseudo-inverse operator that originates from the fact that the one-step denoised solution is not assumed to be deterministic, rather modeled as a Gaussian distribution. Through an extensive set of numerical examples on two geophysical inverse problems (namely, seismic interpolation and seismic inversion), I show that two key aspects for the success of any measurement-guided diffusion process are: i) our ability to re-parametrize the inverse problem such that the sought after model is bounded between -1 and 1 (a pre-requisite for any diffusion model); ii) the choice of the training dataset used to learn the implicit prior that guides the reverse diffusion process. Numerical examples on synthetic and field datasets reveal that PGDM outperforms DPS in both scenarios at limited additional cost.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous emulation and downscaling with physically-consistent deep learning-based regional ocean emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on top of the success in AI-based atmospheric emulation, we propose an AI-based ocean emulation and downscaling framework focusing on the high-resolution regional ocean over Gulf of Mexico. Regional ocean emulation presents unique challenges owing to the complex bathymetry and lateral boundary conditions as well as from fundamental biases in deep learning-based frameworks, such as instability and hallucinations. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based framework to autoregressively integrate ocean-surface variables over the Gulf of Mexico at $8$ Km spatial resolution without unphysical drifts over decadal time scales and simulataneously downscale and bias-correct it to $4$ Km resolution using a physics-constrained generative model. The framework shows both short-term skills as well as accurate long-term statistics in terms of mean and variability.</description>

      <title>Winter Noctilucent Clouds Following Sudden Stratospheric Warming: First Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesospheric structures identical to summer noctilucent clouds were observed during the evening and the morning twilight of the night of December 17-18, 2024 in Siberian Russia. Basing on the available photo data, the mean altitude of the clouds 70.1+-1.5 km was measured by umbral colorimetric method. This coincided spatially and temporary with deep temperature minimum below 160K in mesosphere, followed the polar vortex displacement and warming of stratosphere below the clouds. The satellite data on temperature and water vapor is used to study the nature of this unexpected event.</description>
