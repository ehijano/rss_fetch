      <title>Resolving Kane's Puzzle in Oblique Collisions of Rigid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the asymmetric deformation in collisions and the transition conditions from oblique to normal collisions and non-collisions to address the problem of oblique collisions of rigid bodies in classical mechanics. A closed solution satisfying the fundamental equations and adhering to the energy conservation law without introducing new material parameters was derived. The solution exhibited a nonlinear relationship between post-collision velocity and initial state parameters, contrasting with the linear results of existing studies. This solution avoided the fallacy in Whittaker's hypothesis that kinetic energy might increase after a collision. Consequently, the solution presented herein fundamentally resolves Kane's puzzle, previously overlooked in classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Measuring thermal contact resistances between metallic rods using laser spot heating and infrared thermography. Part 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of thermal contact resistances between cylinders can be achieved using heating on the cross sections by a laser spot and measurement of the temperature response by IR thermography. This type of measurement makes it possible to characterise contacts in clusters of cylinders to simulate clusters of grains, or the properties of fibrous media in the transverse direction or, under certain conditions, to detect emerging thermal resistances (cracks perpendicular to the observation plane) by IR thermography. Here, the thermal model is simplified because the temperature field in relaxation on either side of the resistance can be considered isothermal with a separation of transfers in the plane and along the thickness. The mathematical model is then analytical (relaxation of a linear system), and the processing of the temperature field can be inversed thanks to the consideration of the logarithm of matrices, useful when studying the propagation of measurement noise. The method proposed in the case of two or three cylinders is a first step and a validation for applications to the study of more complex media (large number of cylinders, granular media).</description>

      <title>The Dirac--Bergmann approach to optimal control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for optimal control in both classical and quantum systems. Our approach leverages the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm: a systematic method for formulating and solving constrained dynamical systems. In contrast to the standard Pontryagin Principle, which is used in control theory, our approach bypasses the need to perform a variation to obtain the optimal solution. Instead, the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm generates the optimal solution automatically, through the closure of the Poission Bracket algebra of the full set of constraints and the Hamiltonian. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through two quintessential examples: (1) the classical brachistochrone problem and (2) the time-optimal control of a generic quantum system, relevant for quantum technological applications. In the latter example, both closed and open quantum systems are discussed.</description>
