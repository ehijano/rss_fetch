      <title>Evaluation of GlassNet for physics-informed machine learning of glass stability and glass-forming ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glasses form the basis of many modern applications and also hold great potential for future medical and environmental applications. However, their structural complexity and large composition space make design and optimization challenging for certain applications. Of particular importance for glass processing is an estimate of a given composition's glass-forming ability (GFA). However, there remain many open questions regarding the physical mechanisms of glass formation, especially in oxide glasses. It is apparent that a proxy for GFA would be highly useful in glass processing and design, but identifying such a surrogate property has proven itself to be difficult. Here, we explore the application of an open-source pre-trained NN model, GlassNet, that can predict the characteristic temperatures necessary to compute glass stability (GS) and assess the feasibility of using these physics-informed ML (PIML)-predicted GS parameters to estimate GFA. In doing so, we track the uncertainties at each step of the computation - from the original ML prediction errors, to the compounding of errors during GS estimation, and finally to the final estimation of GFA. While GlassNet exhibits reasonable accuracy on all individual properties, we observe a large compounding of error in the combination of these individual predictions for the prediction of GS, finding that random forest models offer similar accuracy to GlassNet. We also breakdown the ML performance on different glass families and find that the error in GS prediction is correlated with the error in crystallization peak temperature prediction. Lastly, we utilize this finding to assess the relationship between top-performing GS parameters and GFA for two ternary glass systems: sodium borosilicate and sodium iron phosphate glasses. We conclude that to obtain true ML predictive capability of GFA, significantly more data needs to be collected.</description>

      <title>X-ray Nano-imaging of a Heterogeneous Structural Phase Transition in V2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the Mott transition through strain engineering is crucial for advancing the development and application of memristive and neuromorphic computing devices. Yet, Mott insulators are heterogeneous due to intrinsic phase boundaries and extrinsic defects, posing significant challenges to fully understanding the impact of local microscopic distortions on the local Mott transition, which demands structural characterizations at the relevant length scale. Here, using a synchrotron-based scanning X-ray nanoprobe, we studied the real-space structural heterogeneity during the structural phase transition in a V2O3 thin film, with a resolution of 30 nm. Through temperature-dependent metal-insulator phase coexistence mapping, we report a variation in the local transition temperature of up to 7 K across the film and the presence of the transition hysteresis at the nanoscale. Furthermore, a detailed quantitative analysis demonstrates that the spatial heterogeneity of the transition is closely tied to the tilting of crystallographic planes in the pure insulating phase. We develop a structural model allowing us to interpret these tilts as variation of the monoclinic distortion during the rhombohedral-monoclinic phase transition. Our work highlights the impact of local heterogeneous lattice distortions on the Mott transition and lays the groundwork for future innovations in harnessing strain heterogeneity within Mott systems for the next-generation computational technologies.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Exchange Fields for Ab-initio Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We add the magnetic degrees of freedom to the widely used Gaussian Approximation Potential of machine learning (ML) and present a model that describes the potential energy surface of a crystal based on the atomic coordinates as well as their noncollinear magnetic moments. Assuming an adiabatic approximation for the spin directions and magnitudes, the ML model depends solely on spin coordinates and orientation, resulting in computational efffciency and enabling ab initio spin dynamics. Leveraging rotational symmetries of magnetic interactions, the ML model can incorporate various magnetic interactions, expanding into two-body, three-body terms, etc., following the spirit of cluster expansion. For simplicity, we implement the ML model with a two-body form for the exchange interaction. Comparing total energies and local fields predicted by the model for noncollinear spin arrangements with explicit results of constrained noncollinear density functional calculations for bcc Fe yields excellent results, within 1 meV/spin for the total energy. Further optimization, including three-body and other terms, is expected to encompass diverse magnetic interactions and enhance the model's accuracy. This will extend the model's applicability to a wide range of materials and facilitate the machine learning ab initio spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deep learning generative model for crystal structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning generative models (GMs) have created unprecedented high capabilities in accessing and assessing complex high-dimensional data, allowing superior efficiency in navigating vast material configuration space in search of viable structures. Coupling such capabilities with physically significant data to construct trained models for materials discovery is crucial to moving this emerging field forward. Here, we present a universal GM for crystal structure prediction (CSP) via a conditional crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (Cond-CDVAE) approach, which is tailored to allow user-defined material and physical parameters such as composition and pressure. This model is trained on an expansive dataset containing over 670,000 local minimum structures, including a rich spectrum of high-pressure structures, along with ambient-pressure structures in Materials Project database. We demonstrate that the Cond-CDVAE model can generate physically plausible structures with high fidelity under diverse pressure conditions without necessitating local optimization, accurately predicting 59.3% of the 3,547 unseen ambient-pressure experimental structures within 800 structure samplings, with the accuracy rate climbing to 83.2% for structures comprising fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell. These results meet or exceed those achieved via conventional CSP methods based on global optimization. The present findings showcase substantial potential of GMs in the realm of CSP.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced charge state dynamics of the neutral and negatively charged silicon vacancy centers in room-temperature diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamond is drawing much attention due to its optical and spin properties, attractive for quantum information processing and sensing. Comparatively little is known, however, about the dynamics governing SiV charge state interconversion mainly due to challenges associated with generating, stabilizing, and characterizing all possible charge states, particularly at room temperature. Here, we use multi-color confocal microscopy and density functional theory to examine photo-induced SiV recombination - from neutral, to single-, to double-negatively charged - over a broad spectral window in chemical-vapor-deposition diamond under ambient conditions. For the SiV0 to SiV- transition, we find a linear growth of the photo-recombination rate with laser power at all observed wavelengths, a hallmark of single photon dynamics. Laser excitation of SiV-, on the other hand, yields only fractional recombination into SiV2-, a finding we interpret in terms of a photo-activated electron tunneling process from proximal nitrogen atoms.</description>

      <title>Carrier confinement and alloy disorder exacerbate Auger-Meitner recombination in AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum efficiency of AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) declines (droops) at increasing operating powers due to Auger-Meitner recombination (AMR). Using first-principles density-functional theory, we show that indirect AMR mediated by electron-phonon coupling and alloy disorder can induce bulk $C$ coefficients as large as $\sim10^{-31}$ cm$^6$/s. Furthermore, we find that the confinement of carriers by polarization fields within quantum wells severely relaxes crystal-momentum conservation, which exacerbates the rate of AMR over radiative recombination by an order of magnitude relative to the bulk. This results in a striking decrease in quantum efficiency at high power. Suppressing polarization fields and jointly increasing the well width would greatly mitigate AMR and efficiency droop.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and Mechanistic Insights into the Tension-Compression Asymmetry of Rapidly Solidified Fe-Cr Alloys: A Phase Field and Strain Gradient Plasticity Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid solidification in Additively Manufactured (AM) metallic materials results in the development of significant microscale internal stresses, which are attributed to the printing induced dislocation substructures. The resulting backstress due to the Geometrically Necessary Dislocations (GNDs) is responsible for the observed Tension-Compression (TC) asymmetry. We propose a combined Phase Field (PF)-Strain Gradient $J_2$ Plasticity (SGP) framework to investigate the TC asymmetry in such microstructures. The proposed PF model is an extension of Kobayashi's dendritic growth framework, modified to account for the orientation-based anisotropy and multi-grain interaction effects. The SGP model has consideration for anisotropic temperature-dependent elasticity, dislocation strengthening, solid solution strengthening, along with GND-induced directional backstress. This model is employed to predict the solute segregation, dislocation substructure and backstress development during solidification and the post-solidification anisotropic mechanical properties in terms of the TC asymmetry of rapidly solidified Fe-Cr alloys. It is observed that higher thermal gradients (and hence, cooling rates) lead to higher magnitudes of solute segregation, GND density, and backstress. This also correlates with a corresponding increase in the predicted TC asymmetry. The results presented in this study point to the microstructural factors, such as dislocation substructure and solute segregation, and mechanistic factors, such as backstress, which may contribute to the development of TC asymmetry in rapidly solidified microstructures.</description>

      <title>Electrically controlled nonvolatile switching of single-atom magnetism in a Dy@C84 single-molecule transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-atom magnetism switching is a key technique towards the ultimate data storage density of computer hard disks and has been conceptually realized by leveraging the spin bistability of a magnetic atom under a scanning tunnelling microscope. However, it has rarely been applied to solid-state transistors, an advancement that would be highly desirable for enabling various applications. Here, we demonstrate realization of the electrically controlled Zeeman effect in Dy@C84 single-molecule transistors, thus revealing a transition in the magnetic moment from 3.8 {\mu}B to 5.1 {\mu}B for the ground-state GN at an electric field strength of 3-10 MV/cm. The consequent magnetoresistance significantly increases from 600% to 1100% at the resonant tunneling point. Density functional theory calculations further corroborate our realization of nonvolatile switching of single-atom magnetism, and the switching stability emanates from an energy barrier of 92 meV for atomic relaxation. These results highlight the potential of using endohedral metallofullerenes for high-temperature, high-stability, high-speed, and compact single-atom magnetic data storage.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of the vertical dielectric screening dependence on defects for few-layered van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principle calculations were employed to analyze the effects induced by vacancies of molybdenum (Mo) and sulfur (S) on the dielectric properties of few-layered MoS2. We explored the combined effects of vacancies and dipole interactions on the dielectric properties of few-layered MoS2. In the presence of dielectric screening, we investigated uniformly distributed Mo and S vacancies, and then considered the case of concentrated vacancies. Our results show that the dielectric screening remarkably depends on the distribution of vacancies owing to the polarization induced by the vacancies and on the interlayer distances. This conclusion was validated for a wide range of wide-gap semiconductors with different positions and distributions of vacancies, providing an effective and reliable method for calculating and predicting electrostatic screening of dimensionally reduced materials. We further provided a method for engineering the dielectric constant by changing the interlayer distance, tuning the number of vacancies and the distribution of vacancies in few-layered van der Waals materials for their application in nanodevices and supercapacitors.</description>

      <title>Resistive and ballistic phonon transport in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic thermal conductivity and the phonon mean free path (mfp) in monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ single crystals and homoepitaxial films of several $\mu$m were determined using the 3$\omega$-method in the temperature range from 10K-300 K. The measured effective thermal conductivity of both, single crystal and homoepitaxial films are in the order of 20 W/(mK) at room temperature, below 30 K it increases with a maximum of 1000 to 2000 W/(mK) and decreases with T$^3$ below 25 K. Analysis of the phonon mfp shows a dominance of phonon-phonon-Umklapp scattering above 80 K, below which the influence of point-defect scattering is observed. Below 30 K the phonon mfp increases until it is limited by the total $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ sample size. A crossover from resistive to ballistic phonon transport is observed below 20 K and boundary effects of the total sample size become dominant. This reveals that the homoepitaxial film-substrate interface is highly phonon-transparent. The resistive and ballistic phonon transport regimes in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ are discussed corresponding to the models of Callaway and Majumdar, respectively.</description>

      <title>Surface region band enhancement in noble gas adsorption assisted ARPES on kagome superconductor RbV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic states near surface regions can be distinct from bulk states, which are paramount in understanding various physical phenomena occurring at surfaces and in applications in semiconductors, energy, and catalysis. Here, we report an abnormal surface region band enhancement effect in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on kagome superconductor RbV3Sb5, by depositing noble gases with fine control. In contrast to conventional surface contamination, the intensity of surface region Sb band can be enhanced more than three times with noble gas adsorption. In the meantime, a hole-dope effect is observed for the enhanced surface region band, with other bands hardly changing. The doping effect is more pronounced with heavier noble gases. We propose that noble gas atoms selectively fill into alkali metal vacancy sites on the surface, which improves the surface condition, boosts surface region bands, and effectively dopes it with the Pauli repulsion mechanism. Our results provide a novel and reversible way to improve surface conditions and tune surface region bands by controlled surface noble gas deposition.</description>

      <title>Optical manipulation of the topological phase in ZrTe5 revealed by time- and angle-resolved photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements were conducted on the topological insulator ZrTe5. With strong femtosecond photoexcitation, a possible ultrafast phase transition from a weak to a strong topological insulating phase was experimentally realized by recovering the energy gap inversion in a time scale that was shorter than 0.15 ps. This photoinduced transient strong topological phase can last longer than 2 ps at the highest excitation fluence studied, and it cannot be attributed to the photoinduced heating of electrons or modification of the conduction band filling. Additionally, the measured unoccupied electronic states are consistent with the first-principles calculation based on experimental crystal lattice constants, which favor a strong topological insulating phase. These findings provide new insights into the longstanding controversy about the strong and weak topological properties in ZrTe5, and they suggest that many-body effects including electron-electron interactions must be taken into account to understand the equilibrium weak topological insulating phase in ZrTe5.</description>

      <title>Thiol-amine co-solvents aided direct synthesis of ZnTe thin films by spin coating for low cost optoelectronic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zinc telluride (ZnTe) thin films have special semiconducting characteristics that make them very promising for a broad range of optoelectronic applications. In this work, a novel approach for synthesizing ZnTe thin films by spin coating technique is followed using a unique solution process with ZnTe directly dissolving in thiol-amine co-solvents. Thin films are synthesized on glass substrates and air annealed at 250-350 {\deg}C. The polycrystalline phase of ZnTe is revealed through the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to observe the evolution of surface smoothness with annealing temperature. Moreover, elemental compositions of ZnTe thin film have been determined by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) study. FTIR spectroscopy reveals that ZnTe has been successfully synthesized as confirmed by the characteristic peaks in the spectrum of 750-1000 cm-1. Optical properties of the ZnTe thin films have been investigated using UV-vis spectroscopy. The transmittance of the films increases with annealing temperature. Furthermore, the optical bandgaps of the films of 2.92, 2.84, and 2.5 eV have been found at 250, 300, and 350 {\deg}C annealing temperatures, respectively. These results suggest that controlling the annealing environment serves as a valuable strategy for tailoring the ZnTe film properties to meet specific application requirements. These results reveal that spin coated ZnTe thin films are attractive ones for various applications in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic order influenced phonon and electron dynamics in MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ through terahertz time-domain spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$, the first topological insulator with inherent magnetic ordering, has attracted significant attention recently for providing a platform to realize several exotic quantum phenomena at relatively higher temperatures. In this work, we have carried out an exhaustive investigation of MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ thin films using THz time-domain spectroscopy. The extracted real THz conductivity displays a strong IR active E$_u$ phonon absorption peak (at $\sim$1.5 THz) merged on top of the Drude-like contributions from bulk and surface electrons. The extracted parameters from the THz conductivity data fitted to the Drude-Fano-Lorentz model, show significant changes in their temperature dependence around the magnetic ordering N\'eel temperature of $\sim$ 25K, which is suggestive of the coupling between magnetic ordering and electronic band structure. The frequency of the E$_u$ phonon displays an anomalous blue-shift with increasing temperatures by $\sim$ 0.1 THz ($\sim$7 %) for MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and $\sim$0.2 THz ($\sim$13 %) for Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ between 7K and 250K. The line-shape of the E$_u$ phonon mode in Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ shows significant Fano asymmetry compared to that of MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$, indicating that Sb doping plays an important role in the Fano interference between the phonons and the electrons, in this system. These results indicate that the anomalous phonon behaviour seen in MBT arise mainly from positive cubic anharmonicity induced self energy parameter, whereas both anharmonicity and the electron phonon coupling are at play in making the relatively higher anomalous blue shift of phonons in MBST. Our studies provide the first comprehensive understanding of the phonon and electron dynamics of MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ in the THz range using time-domain THz spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite oxides have been indeed proved to be valuable materials in optoelectronic applications. The combination of indium oxide and gallium oxide and other materials can lead to enhanced optical and electronic properties, making them suitable for a variety of optoelectronic devices. Meticulous analysis of the various optical properties helped to draw conclusions about the heterostructure of Indium and Gallium oxide and its use as a suitable semiconducting material in the medium bandgap range. The density of states and the band structure have been obtained from the density functional theory calculations. Real frequency phonon density of states supports dynamical stability of the crystal structure. A favorable energy band gap is achieved in the visible region of the spectrum, indicating that this mixed oxide is well suited for optoelectronic devices such as LEDs and solar cells.</description>

      <title>Layer dependent topological phases and transitions in TaRhTe$_4$: From monolayer and bilayer to bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently synthesized ternary quasi-2D material TaRhTe$_4$ is a bulk Weyl semimetal with an intrinsically layered structure, which poses the question how the topology of its electronic structure depends on layers separations. Experimentally these separations may be changed for instance by intercalation of the bulk, or by exfoliation to reach monolayer or few-layer structures. Here we show that in the monolayer limit a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) state emerges, employing density functional calculations as well as a minimal four-orbital tight-binding model that we develop. Even for weak spin-orbit couplings the QSHI is present, which has an interesting edge state that features Rashba-split bands with quadratic band minima. Further we find that a weak topological insulator (WTI) manifests in the bilayer system due to sizable intralayer hopping, contrary to the common lore that only weak interlayer interactions between stacked QSHIs lead to WTIs. Stacked bilayers give rise to a phase diagram as function of the interlayer separation that comprises a Weyl semimetal, WTI and normal insulator phases. These insights on the evolution of topology with dimension can be transferred to the family of layered ternary transition metal tellurides.</description>

      <title>Tuning of the ultrafast demagnetization by ultrashort spin polarized currents in multi-sublattice ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser pulses can be used to induce ultrafast changes of the magnetization in magnetic materials. Several microscopic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observations, including the transport of ultrashort spin-polarized hot-electrons (SPHE). Such ultrafast spin currents find growing interest because of the recent challenges in ultrafast spintronics however they are only poorly characterized. One of the key challenges is to characterize the spin-polarized ultrafast currents and the microscopic mechanisms behind SPHE induced manipulation of the magnetization, especially in the case of technologically relevant ferrimagnetic alloys. Here, we have used a combined approach using time- and element-resolved X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and theoretical calculations based on atomistic spin-dynamics simulations to address the ultrafast transfer of the angular momentum from spin-polarized currents into ferrimagnetic Fe74Gd26 films and the concomitant reduction of sub-lattice magnetization. Our study shows that using a Co/Pt multilayer as a polarizer in a spin-valve structure, the SPHE drives the demagnetization of the two sub-lattices of the Fe74Gd26 film. This behaviour is explained based on two physical mechanisms, i.e., spin transfer torque and thermal fluctuations induced by the SPHE. We provide a quantitative description of the heat transfer of the ultrashort SPHE pulse to the Fe74Gd26 films, as well as the degree of spin-polarization of the SPHE current density responsible for the observed magnetization dynamics. Our work finally characterizes the spin-polarization of the SPHEs revealing unexpected opposite spin polarization to the Co magnetization, explaining our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Work Function Dependent Reduction of Transition Metal Nitrides (TMNs) in Hydrogen Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amidst the growing importance of hydrogen in a sustainable future, it is critical to develop coatings that can protect system components in reactive hydrogen environments. However, the prediction of the chemical stability of materials in hydrogen is not fully understood. In this study, we show that the work function is a key parameter determining the reducibility (i.e., de-nitridation) of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) in hydrogen radicals (H*). We demonstrate that when the work function of a TMN drops below a threshold limit, its reduction effectively stops. This finding provides a novel perspective for comprehending the hydrogen and transition metal compounds interaction and allows predicting the chemical stability of hydrogen-protective coatings.</description>

      <title>Ultralarge polarization in ferroelectric hafnia-based thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnia-based ferroelectrics have become a valuable class of electronic functional materials at the nanoscale, showing great potential for next-generation memory and logic devices. However, more robust ferroelectric properties and better understanding of the polarization mechanisms are currently needed both in technology and science. Herein, we report the properties of oxygen-deficient Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films with ultralarge remanent polarization (Pr) of 387 uC cm-2 at room temperature (1 kHz). Structure characterizations identify a new ferroelectric monoclinic Pc phase in these Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films. The in-situ STEM measurements evidence polar displacements of the oxygen atoms, which move up and down in the Pc structure under applied DC bias fields, showing a huge displacement (1.6 A). DFT calculations optimized the Pc structure and also predicted a large polarization. The coexistence of the ferroelectric monoclinic (Pc) phases and orthorhombic (Pca21) is responsible for this superior ferroelectric properties. These findings are promising for hafnia-based ferroelectric applications in integrated ferroelectric devices, energy harvesting and actuators, etc.</description>

      <title>In-situ observation of field-induced nano-protrusion growth on a carbon-coated tungsten nanotip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-protrusion (NP) on metal surface and its inevitable contamination layer under high electric field is often considered as the primary precursor that leads to vacuum breakdown, which plays an extremely detrimental effect for high energy physics equipment and many other devices. Yet, the NP growth has never been experimentally observed. Here, we conduct field emission (FE) measurements along with in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging of an amorphous-carbon (a-C) coated tungsten nanotip at various nanoscale vacuum gap distances. We find that under certain conditions, the FE current-voltage (I-V) curves switch abruptly into an enhanced-current state, implying the growth of an NP. We then run field emission simulations, demonstrating that the temporary enhanced-current I-V is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that a NP has grown at the apex of the tip. This hypothesis is also confirmed by the repeatable in-situ observation of such a nano-protrusion and its continued growth during successive FE measurements in TEM. We tentatively attribute this phenomenon to field-induced biased diffusion of surface a-C atoms, after performing a finite element analysis that excludes the alternative possibility of field-induced plastic deformation.</description>

      <title>Polarization multistates in composite ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Going beyond the bistability paradigm of the charge polarizations in ferroelectrics is highly desired for ferroelectric memory devices toward ultra-high density information storage. Here, we propose to build multistates in composite ferroelectrics, which have both the intrinsic and sliding-induced polarizations. We illustrate the concept in H-stacking bilayers of 1T'' transition-metal dichalcogenides by first-principle calculations. We find that there is at least one order of magnitude difference in the energy barriers between these two types polarizations, which suggests that the external electric fields required to flipping them are significantly different. This difference allows for a novel flipping mechanism involving layer sliding and layer-by-layer flipping for the transforming of the polarization states. As a result, sextuple switchable states can be achieved for the 1T'' bilayers by properly controlling electrical field. Our study provides a new route to design polarization multistates for developing next-generation memory devices.</description>

      <title>Discovery of self-assembled Ru/Si heterostructures with unique periodic nanostripe patterns boosting hydrogen evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) heterostructuring is a versatile methodology for designing nanoarchitecture catalytic systems that allow for reconstruction and modulation of interfaces and electronic structures. However, catalysts with such structures are extremely scarce due to limited synthetic strategies. Here, we report a highly ordered 2D Ru/Si nano-heterostructures (RSHS) by acid etching of the LaRuSi electride. RSHS shows a superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution with an overpotential of 14 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in alkaline media. Both experimental analysis and first-principles calculations demonstrate that the electronic states of Ru can be tuned by strong interactions of the interfacial Ru-Si, leading to an optimized hydrogen adsorption energy. Moreover, due to the synergistic effect of Ru and Si, the energy barrier of water dissociation is significantly reduced. The unique nanostripe structure with abundant interfaces in RSHS will provide a paradigm for construction of efficient catalysts with tunable electronic states and dual active sites.</description>

      <title>Effect of photoinduced screening on the spectroscopic signature of exciton-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light-mediated interaction of fermionic and bosonic excitations governs the optoelectronic properties of condensed matter systems. In photoexcited semiconductors, the coupling of electron-hole pairs (excitons) to coherent optical phonons enables a modulation of the excitonic resonance that is phase-locked to the frequency of the coupled vibrational mode. Moreover, due to the Coulombic nature of excitons, their dynamics are sensitive to transient changes in the screening by the photoexcited carriers. Interestingly, the effect of photoinduced screening on the transient optical signal originating from the exciton dynamics coupled to phonons is not yet established. By means of broadband transient reflectance spectroscopy, we disclose how exciton-phonon coupling manifests in either presence or absence of dynamical screening in a layered semiconductor. Further, we unveil the promoting role of photoinduced screening on these exciton-phonon coupled dynamics as opposed to the case in which the unscreened exciton-exciton repulsion likely dominates the nonequilibrium optical response. These findings set a protocol to look at an excitonic resonance and its fundamental many-body interactions on the ultrafast timescale, and provide new perspectives on the access to nonequilibrium coupled dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dielectric Properties in Models of Amorphous Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a theoretical study of dielectric properties of models of amorphous Boron Nitride, using interatomic potentials generated by machine learning. We first perform first-principles simulations on small (about $100$ atoms in the periodic cell) sample sizes to explore the emergence of mid-gap states and its correlation with structural features. Next, by using a simplified tight-binding electronic model, we analyse the dielectric functions for complex three dimensional models (containing about $10.000$ atoms) embedding varying concentrations of ${\rm sp^{1}, sp^{2}}$ and ${\rm sp^3}$ bonds between B and N atoms. Within the limits of these methodologies, the resulting value of the zero-frequency dielectric constant is shown to be influenced by the population density of such mid-gap states and their localization characteristics. We observe nontrivial correlations between the structure-induced electronic fluctuations and the resulting dielectric constant values. Our findings are however just a first step in the quest of accessing fully accurate dielectric properties of as-grown amorphous BN of relevance for interconnect technologies and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Half-metallic ferromagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as important building blocks for scalable magnonics and memory applications. Downscaling such systems to the ultra-thin limit is critical to integrate them into technology. Here, we achieved layer-by-layer control over the transition metal dichalcogenide Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ by using pulsed laser deposition, and we uncovered the minimum critical thickness above which room temperature magnetic order is maintained. The electronic and magnetic structure is explored experimentally and theoretically and it is shown that the films exhibit strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy as a consequence of large spin-orbit effects. Our study establishes Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ as a platform material, viable for ferromagnetic nanoscale devices and magnetic-memory architectures.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Electron Extraction in Co-Doped TiO2 Quantified by Drift-Diffusion Simulation for Stable CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar cells based on inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 are promising candidates to resolve the challenge of operational stability in the field of perovskite photovoltaics. For stable operation, however, it is crucial to thoroughly understand the extractive and recombinative processes occurring at the interfaces of perovskite and the charge-selective layers. In this study, we focus on the electronic properties of (doped) TiO2 as an electron-selective contact. We show via KPFM that co-doping of TiO2 with Nb(V) and Sn(IV) reduces the materials work function by 270 meV, giving it stronger n-type characteristics compared to Nb(V) mono-doped TiO2. The altered electronic alignment with CsPbI3 translates to enhanced electron extraction, as demonstrated with ssPL, trPL and trSPV in triad. Importantly, we extract crucial parameters, such as the concentration of extracted electrons and the interface hole recombination velocity, from the SPV transients via 2D drift-diffusion simulations. When implementing the co-doped TiO2 into full n-i-p solar cells, the operational stability is enhanced to 32000 h of projected TS80 lifetime. This study provides fundamental understanding of interfacial charge extraction and its correlation with operational stability of perovskite solar cells, which can be transferred to other charge-selective contacts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the flow of an electrically charged fluid through an elastic and porous medium. A three continuum model consisting of an elastic solid, a viscous fluid, and a mobile charge continuum is used. The relevant laws of physics are applied systematically to the constituents or the combined continuum, leading to their continuity equations for conservation of mass or charge, linear and angular momentum equations as well as constitutive relations. The analysis assumes quasistatic electric fields and is for nonmagnetizable materials. The resulting theory is nonlinear, valid for large deformations and strong fields and can be specialized or generalized in various ways.</description>

      <title>Interaction between U-shaped amyloid beta fibril and semiconducting silicon nitride monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by some recent works showing the ability of semiconducting monolayers to disintegrate the structures of biological fibrils, we have applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in both classical and quantum regimes to investigate whether semiconducting Si$_3$N$_4$ monolayer has the same ability on interaction with U-shaped amyloid beta (A$\beta$) fibril. A number of conventional MD indicators have then been calculated including root mean square deviation, gyration radius, per-residue root mean square fluctuation, number of hydrogen bonds, solvent-accessible surface area, and secondary structure of the fibril as functions of time. Results showed that the monolayer is capable of affecting fibril's conformation. We also found that disintegration begins from the last chain (chain E) due to the rather strong interaction between the monolayer and the fibril residues numbered from 17 to 28 on the very chain, also engaging the next chain (chain D) as the time goes by. The $\beta$-sheet-rich content of chain E accordingly turns into other secondary-structure types including "turn", "coil", and "isolated bridge", decreasing the $\beta$-sheet content of the entire fibril as well. Results support the view that Si$_3$N$_4$ monolayer has a potential for destabilizing the structure of U-shaped amyloid beta fibrils.</description>

      <title>New insights into the origin of the first sharp diffraction peak in amorphous silica from an analysis of chemical and radial ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural origin of the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in amorphous silica is studied by analyzing chemical and radial ordering of silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) atoms in binary amorphous networks. The study shows that the chemical order involving Si--O and O--O pairs play a major role in the formation of the FSDP in amorphous silica. This is supplemented by small contributions arising from the relatively weak Si--Si correlations in the Fourier space. A shell-by-shell analysis of the radial correlations between Si--Si, Si--O and O--O atoms in the network reveals that the position and the intensity of the FSDP are largely determined by atomic pair correlations originating from the first two/three radial shells on a length scale of about 5--8 {\AA}, whereas the fine structure of the intensity curve in the vicinity of the FSDP is perturbatively modified by atomic correlations arising from the radial shells beyond 8 {\AA}. The study leads to a simple mathematical relationship between the position of the radial peaks ($r_k$) in the partial pair-correlation functions and the diffraction peaks ($Q_k$) that can be used to obtain approximate positions of the FSDP and the principal peak. The results are complemented by numerical calculations and an accurate semi-analytical expression for the diffraction intensity obtained from the partial pair-correlation functions of amorphous silica for a given radial shell.</description>

      <title>Emergent $D_8^{(1)}$ spectrum and topological soliton excitation in CoNb$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum integrability emerging near a quantum critical point (QCP) is manifested by exotic excitation spectrum that is organized by the associated algebraic structure. A well known example is the emergent $E_8$ integrability near the QCP of a transverse field Ising chain (TFIC), which was long predicted theoretically and initially proposed to be realized in the quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) quantum magnet CoNb$_2$O$_6$. However, later measurements on the spin excitation spectrum of this material revealed a series of satellite peaks that cannot be described by the $E_8$ Lie algebra. Motivated by these experimental progresses, we hereby revisit the spin excitations of CoNb$_2$O$_6$ by combining numerical calculation and analytical analysis. We show that, as effects of strong interchain fluctuations, the spectrum of the system near the 1D QCP is characterized by the $D_{8}^{(1)}$ Lie algebra with robust topological soliton excitation. We further show that the $D_{8}^{(1)}$ spectrum can be realized in a broad class of interacting quantum systems. Our results advance the exploration of integrability and manipulation of topological excitations in quantum critical systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Haldane Model and Photon-Valley Locking in Chiral Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of Haldane's topological graphene model in practical materials has presented significant challenges. Here, we propose achieving this model by embedding graphene in chiral cavities, using the asymptotically decoupled framework detailed in Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 153603 (2021)]. Additionally, we introduce an equilibrium strategy for achieving valley polarization in this system with C2-symmetry breaking. Through numerical methods, we quantify the locking of photon numbers with Bloch electrons and calculate the topology-induced imbalance of valley photons. Furthermore, we elucidate that topological phase transition is characterized by the sign change of photon numbers during interband excitation. These findings underscore the remarkable potential of utilizing cavity quantum fluctuations to engineer electronic and photonic properties specific to valleys and topologies, particularly within the realm of strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Stress relaxation and thermo-visco-elastic effects in fluid-filled slits and fluid-loaded plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically analyse wave propagation in two canonical problems of interest: fluid-filled thermo-visco-elastic slits and fluid-loaded thermo-visco-elastic plates. We show that these two configurations can be studied via the same pair of dispersion equations with the aid of the framework developed in [https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2022.0193], which incoporates thermal effects. These two problems are further interrelated, since in the short wavelength limit (relative to the slit/plate width) the respective modes are governed by the same dispersion equation, commonly known as the Scholte--Stoneley equation. It is the Scholte-type modes that are mainly analyzed in this paper. We illustrate results when the fluid is water, although the theory is valid for any Newtonian fluid. Both `hard' and `soft' solids are compared, with the emphasis being placed on the importance of thermo-viscoelastic effects, particularly when stress relaxation is considered. Two main recent works are discussed extensively, namely [https://doi.org/10.1121/1.5078528] for slits and [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.063002] for loaded plates, both of which do not incorporate viscoelastic mechanisms. We show how the consideration of viscoelasticity can extend the results discussed therein, and explain the circumstances under which they arise.</description>

      <title>Electrical reversal of the sign for magnon thermal Hall coefficient in van der Waals bilayer antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With spin-layer locking, the manipulation of spin degree of freedom via perpendicular electric field can be realized in a typical antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer. In analogy to the electric control of the anomalous layer Hall effect of electron within such bilayer system, we propose here its magnon counterpart i.e., thermal Hall effect controlled by a perpendicular electric field. Unlike electrons, magnon is charged neutral and its transport in solids can be driven by a thermal gradient. It also exhibits Hall response due to the intrinsic Berry curvature of magnon, analogous to the achievement in electron system. Taking bilayer 2H-VSe2 with both H-type stacking interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling as a platform, we perform first-principles calculations towards the magnetic exchange coupling parameters under applied electric field perpendicular to the plane. Based on linear spin wave approximation, we then fit the magnon band structures accordingly and calculate the corresponding Berry curvature. The thermal Hall coefficient dependence on the temperature under thermal gradient can be calculated correspondingly in linear response regime. It is shown that electric field reversal is able to reverse the sign of the coefficient. These findings provide a platform for the realization of all-electric magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Modified Steinberg-Guinan elasticity model to describe softening-hardening dual anomaly in vanadium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constitutive models are essential for describing the mechanical behavior of materials under high temperatures and pressures, among which the Steinberg-Guinan (SG) model is widely adopted. Recent work has discovered a peculiar dual anomaly of compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening in the elasticity of compressed vanadium [Phys. Rev. B 104, 134102 (2021)], which is beyond the capability of the SG model to describe. In this work, a modified SG constitutive model is proposed to embody such an anomalous behavior. Elemental vanadium is considered as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of this improved model in describing the dual anomalies of mechanical elasticity. This new variant of the SG model can also be applied to other materials that present an irregular variation in the mechanical elasticity, and is important to faithfully model and simulate the mechanical response of materials under extreme conditions.</description>

Abstract: Deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) shows great promise to significantly accelerate material discovery and potentially revolutionize materials research, which demands a close combination between neural networks and DFT computation. However, current research in this field primarily relies on supervised learning, making the developments of neural networks and DFT isolated from each other. In this work, we present a theoretical framework of neural-network DFT, which unifies the optimization of neural networks with the variational computation of DFT, enabling physics-informed unsupervised learning. Moreover, we develop a differential DFT code incorporated with deep-learning DFT Hamiltonian, and introduce algorithms of automatic differentiation and backpropagation to DFT, demonstrating the concept of neural-network DFT. The advanced neural-network architecture not only surpasses conventional approaches in accuracy and efficiency, but offers a new paradigm for developing deep-learning DFT methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an equivariant neural network for predicting vibrational and phonon modes of molecules and periodic crystals, respectively. These predictions are made by evaluating the second derivative Hessian matrices of the learned energy model that is trained with the energy and force data. Using this method, we are able to efficiently predict phonon dispersion and the density of states for inorganic crystal materials. For molecules, we also derive the symmetry constraints for IR/Raman active modes by analyzing the phonon mode irreducible representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that using Hessian as a new type of higher-order training data improves energy models beyond models that only use lower-order energy and force data. With this second derivative approach, one can directly relate the energy models to the experimental observations for the vibrational properties. This approach further connects to a broader class of physical observables with a generalized energy model that includes external fields.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the spin dissymmetry factor, a measure of the spin-selectivity in the optical transition rate of quantum particles. This spin dissymmetry factor is valid locally, including at material interfaces and within optical cavities. We design and numerically demonstrate an optical cavity with three-fold rotational symmetry that maximizes spin dissymmetry, thereby minimizing the spin dephasing of a cavity-coupled quantum particle. Our approach emphasizes the difference between spin and chirality in the nearfield and reveals a classical parameter for designing more efficient quantum optical devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using density functional theory (DFT) and linear response approaches, we compute the on-site Hubbard interaction $U$ of elemental Terbium (Tb) metal in the pressure range $\sim 0-65$ GPa. The resulting first-principles $U$ values with experimental crystal structures enable us to examine the magnetic properties of Tb using a self-consistent DFT+U method. The lowest-energy magnetic states in our calculations for different high-pressure Tb phases -- including hcp, $\alpha$-Sm, and dhcp -- are found to be compatible with the corresponding magnetic ordering vectors reported in experiments. The result shows that the inclusion of Hubbard $U$ substantially improves the accuracy and efficiency in modeling correlated rare-earth materials. Our study also provides the necessary $U$ information for other quantum many-body techniques to study Tb under extreme pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Long Homochiral Graphene Nanoribbons Grown Within h-BN Stacks for High-Performance Electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals encapsulation of two-dimensional materials within hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) stacks has proven to be a promising way to create ultrahigh-performance electronic devices. However, contemporary approaches for achieving van der Waals encapsulation, which involve artificial layer stacking using mechanical transfer techniques, are difficult to control, prone to contamination, and unscalable. Here, we report on the transfer-free direct growth of high-quality graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) within h-BN stacks. The as-grown embedded GNRs exhibit highly desirable features being ultralong (up to 0.25 mm), ultranarrow ( &lt; 5 nm), and homochiral with zigzag edges. Our atomistic simulations reveal that the mechanism underlying the embedded growth involves ultralow GNR friction when sliding between AA'-stacked h-BN layers. Using the grown structures, we demonstrate the transfer-free fabrication of embedded GNR field-effect devices that exhibit excellent performance at room temperature with mobilities of up to 4,600 $cm^{2} V^{-1} s^{-1}$ and on-off ratios of up to $10^{6}$. This paves the way to the bottom-up fabrication of high-performance electronic devices based on embedded layered materials.</description>

      <title>Fractional Dimensional Approach to Dielectric Tuning Effects on Excitonic Parameters in 2D semiconductor materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrated the potential of the fractional dimensional approach to understand exciton parameters in the exemplary atomically thin semiconductor material, a monolayer of WS$_2$. This approach has proved to be successful in finding the exciton binding energy and quasiparticle bandgap for the WS$_2$ monolayer in varying dielectric environments. A tuning of the quasiparticle bandgap and binding energy by 141 meV and 188 meV, respectively, has been achieved by varying the dielectric of the environment from 1.52 to 8.1. The approach is justified by comparing the changes in the binding energy with the computational results from the Quantum Electrostatic Heterostructures model. The fractional dimension found through the excitonic Rydberg series is close to 2.8 for WS$_2$ monolayer in all different dielectric surroundings. Thus, this approach provides a rapid and robust method for determining the binding energy of excitons in 2D semiconductors independent of the particular dielectric environment.</description>

Notably, a less pronounced NC resulting from the spatial distribution of the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases plays crucial role in stabilizing of n-channel-conductance. This results into the emergence of a non-volatile logic state, between the two binary states of TFETs. Concerned study proposed NC-TFETs based on ferroionic crystals as promising devices for generating a stable logic state below Vth.</description>

      <title>Crystalformer: Infinitely Connected Attention for Periodic Structure Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting physical properties of materials from their crystal structures is a fundamental problem in materials science. In peripheral areas such as the prediction of molecular properties, fully connected attention networks have been shown to be successful. However, unlike these finite atom arrangements, crystal structures are infinitely repeating, periodic arrangements of atoms, whose fully connected attention results in infinitely connected attention. In this work, we show that this infinitely connected attention can lead to a computationally tractable formulation, interpreted as neural potential summation, that performs infinite interatomic potential summations in a deeply learned feature space. We then propose a simple yet effective Transformer-based encoder architecture for crystal structures called Crystalformer. Compared to an existing Transformer-based model, the proposed model requires only 29.4% of the number of parameters, with minimal modifications to the original Transformer architecture. Despite the architectural simplicity, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for various property regression tasks on the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Akali superoxides AO2 (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs), due to an open p shell of the oxygen ion O2^- with degenerate pi orbitals, have spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The complex magnetic, orbital, and structural phase transitions observed experimentally in this family of materials are only partially understood. Based on density functional theory, we derive a strong-coupling effective model for the isostructural compounds AO2 (A=K, Rb, Cs) from a two-orbital Hubbard model. We find that CsO2 has highly frustrated exchange interactions in the a-b plane, while the frustration is weaker for smaller alkali ions. We solve the resulting Kugel-Khomskii model in the mean-field approximation. We show that CsO2 exhibits an antiferro-orbital (AFO) order with the ordering vector q=(1,0,0) and a stripe antiferromagnetic order with q=(1/2,0,0), which is consistent with recent neutron scattering experiments. We discuss the role of the pi-orbital degrees of freedom for the experimentally observed magnetic transitions and interpret the as-yet-unidentified T_s2=70K transition in CsO2 as an orbital ordering transition.</description>

Abstract: Crystal structures are characterized by atomic bases within a primitive unit cell that repeats along a regular lattice throughout 3D space. The periodic and infinite nature of crystals poses unique challenges for geometric graph representation learning. Specifically, constructing graphs that effectively capture the complete geometric information of crystals and handle chiral crystals remains an unsolved and challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the periodic patterns of unit cells to establish the lattice-based representation for each atom, enabling efficient and expressive graph representations of crystals. Furthermore, we propose ComFormer, a SE(3) transformer designed specifically for crystalline materials. ComFormer includes two variants; namely, iComFormer that employs invariant geometric descriptors of Euclidean distances and angles, and eComFormer that utilizes equivariant vector representations.

      <title>A $C^\ast$-algebraic view on the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals is an open problem. We approach it from the viewpoint of $C^\ast$-algebras and calculate all admissible Chern numbers of a strongly coupled tight-binding skyrmion system on a triangular lattice as a function of Fermi energy and texture parameters. Our analysis reveals the topological complexity of electronic states coupled to spin textures, and the failure of the adiabatic picture to account for it in terms of emergent electromagnetism. On the contrary, we explain the discontinuous jumps in the real-space winding number in terms of collective evolution in real-, reciprocal, and mixed space Chern numbers. Our work sets the stage for further research on topological dynamics in complex dynamic spin textures coupled to external fields.</description>

      <title>Measurement-driven Langevin modeling of superparamagnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions are important devices for a range of emerging technologies, but most existing compact models capture only their mean switching rates. Capturing qualitatively accurate analog dynamics of these devices will be important as the technology scales up. Here we present results using a one-dimensional overdamped Langevin equation that captures statistical properties of measured time traces, including voltage histograms, drift and diffusion characteristics as measured with Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and dwell times distributions. While common macrospin models are more physically-motivated magnetic models than the Langevin model, we show that for the device measured here, they capture even fewer of the measured experimental behaviors.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Generative Knowledge Extraction, Graph-Based Representation, and Multimodal Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we transformed a set of 1,000 scientific papers in the area of biological materials into detailed ontological knowledge graphs, revealing their inherently scale-free nature. Using graph traversal path detection between dissimilar concepts based on combinatorial ranking of node similarity and betweenness centrality, we reveal deep insights into unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, and propose never-before-seen material designs and their behaviors. One comparison revealed detailed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. The algorithm further created an innovative hierarchical mycelium-based composite that incorporates joint synthesis of graph sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's Composition VII painting, where the resulting composite reflects a balance of chaos and order, with features like adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across physical, biological, and artistic spheres, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence and material flux that resonates with postmodern philosophy, and positions these interconnections within a heterarchical framework. Our findings reveal the dynamic, context-dependent interplay of entities beyond traditional hierarchical paradigms, emphasizing the significant role of individual components and their fluctuative relationships within the system. Our predictions achieve a far higher degree of novelty, technical detail and explorative capacity than conventional generative AI methods. The approach establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections that facilitate discovery.</description>

      <title>Atomic and electronic structure of defects in hBN: enhancing single-defect functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defect centers in insulators play a critical role in creating important functionalities in materials: prototype qubits, single-photon sources, magnetic field probes, and pressure sensors. These functionalities are highly dependent on their mid-gap electronic structure and orbital/spin wave-function contributions. However, in most cases, these fundamental properties remain unknown or speculative due to the defects being deeply embedded beneath the surface of highly resistive host crystals, thus impeding access through surface probes. Here, we directly inspected the atomic and electronic structures of defects in thin carbon-doped hexagonal boron nitride (hBN:C) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). Such investigation adds direct information about the electronic mid-gap states to the well-established photoluminescence response (including single photon emission) of intentionally created carbon defects in the most commonly investigated van der Waals insulator. Our joint atomic-scale experimental and theoretical investigations reveal two main categories of defects: 1) single-site defects manifesting as donor-like states with atomically resolved structures observable via STM, and 2) multi-site defect complexes exhibiting a ladder of empty and occupied mid-gap states characterized by distinct spatial geometries. Combining direct probing of mid-gap states through tunneling spectroscopy with the inspection of the optical response of insulators hosting specific defect structures holds promise for creating and enhancing functionalities realized with individual defects in the quantum limit. These findings underscore not only the versatility of hBN:C as a platform for quantum defect engineering but also its potential to drive advancements in atomic-scale optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Automating Dislocation Characterization in 3D Dark Field X-ray Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical properties in crystals are strongly correlated to the arrangement of 1D line defects, termed dislocations. Recently, Dark field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) has emerged as a new tool to image and interpret dislocations within crystals using multidimensional scans. However, the methods required to reconstruct meaningful dislocation information from high-dimensional DFXM scans are still nascent and require significant manual oversight (i.e. \textit{supervision}). In this work, we present a new relatively unsupervised method that extracts dislocation-specific information (features) from a 3D dataset ($x$, $y$, $\phi$) using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to represent the large dataset as an array of 3-component feature vectors for each position, corresponding to the weak-beam conditions and the strong-beam condition. This method offers key opportunities to significantly reduce dataset size while preserving only the crystallographic information that is important for data reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Electrically Controlled Anomalous Hall Effect and Orbital Magnetization in Topological Magnet MnBi2Te4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06204v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an intrinsic mechanism to understand the even-odd effect, namely the opposite signs of the anomalous Hall resistance and the different shapes of hysteresis loops for even and odd septuple layers (SLs), of MBE-grown MnBi2Te4 thin films with electron doping. In particular, we show that the non-zero hysteresis loops in the anomalous Hall and magnetic circular dichroism measurements for even-SLs MnBi2Te4 films are originated from two different anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) states with opposite magnetoelectric coefficients that give rise to different energies of zeroth Landau levels of the surface states in this model. The complex form of the anomalous Hall hysteresis loop in even-SLs MnBi2Te4 films can be understood from two magnetic transitions, a transition from one AFM state to the other AFM state followed by a second transition to the ferromagnetic state. Our model also provides a microscopic understanding of the electrical switching between two AFM states via the axion electrodynamics in even-SL MnBi2Te4 films. We further study orbital magnetization and magnetoelectric coefficient in MnBi2Te4 films, and find an even-odd oscillation behavior of the magnetoelectric coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the elementary band representations (EBR), some topologically trivial materials are classified as unconventional ones (obstructed atomic limit), where the EBR decomposition of electronic states is not consistent with the atomic valence-electron band representations. In the work, we identify that the unconventional nature can also exist in phonon spectra, where the EBR decomposition of the phonon modes is not consistent with atomic vibration band representations (ABR). The unconventionality has two types: type I is on an empty site; type II is on an atom site with non-atomic vibration orbitals. Our detailed calculations show that black phosphorus (BP) and 1H-MoSe2 have unconventional both phonon spectra and electronic band structures. The BP has the type-I unconventional phonon spectrum, while 1H-MoSe2 has the type-II one. The obstructed phonon modes are obtained for two types of unconventional phonon spectra.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in unconventional metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that 1H/2H-phase transition metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M=Nb,Ta; X=S,Se,Te) are unconventional metals, which have an empty-site band of $A_1'@1e$ elementary band representation at the Fermi level. The computed phonon dispersions indicate the stability of the system at high temperatures, while the presence of the soft phonon mode suggests a phase transition to the charge density wave state at low temperatures. Based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and computed electron-phonon coupling, our calculations show that the superconductivity (SC) in NbSe2 is mainly attributed to the soft phonon mode due to the half filling of the empty-site band. Accordingly, the SC has been predicted in unconventional metals TaNS monolayer and 2H-TaN2 bulk with computed $T_C=$ 10 K and 26 K respectively. These results demonstrate that the unconventional metals with partial filling of the empty-site band offer an attractive platform to search for superconductors.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnetism in lithium-decorated monolayer CrTe$_{2}$: Interplay between Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and higher-order interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral magnetic states in two-dimensional (2D) layered noncentrosymmetric magnets, which are promising advanced spintronic materials, are usually attributed to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI). However, the role of underlying higher-order spin couplings in determining the properties of chiral spin textures has much less reported. In this work, taking the lithium-decorated monolayer CrTe$_{2}$ (monolayer LiCrTe$_{2}$) as an example, we develop a first-principles-based comprehensive spin model constructed by using the symmetry-adapted cluster expansion method. Based on this spin model, we identify the ground state of monolayer LiCrTe$_{2}$ as a chiral spin spiral state, which can further assemble macroscopic chiral labyrinth domains (LD) under zero-field conditions as well as evolve into skyrmions under a finite magnetic field. Moreover, higher-order biquadratic and three-site interactions are identified to be responsible for modulating both the size and the field stability of the spin spiral state. Our study sheds light on complex magnetic couplings in 2D magnets.</description>

      <title>Picosecond pump pulses probe the relevance of a laser-induced electron-phonon non-equilibrium for the phase transition in FeRh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use ultrafast x-ray diffraction to examine the impact of an electron-phonon non-equilibrium on the kinetics of the antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh parameterized by the structural response. By increasing the pump-pulse duration up to $10.5\,\text{ps}$, we suppressed the non-equilibrium between electrons and phonons present upon femtosecond laser excitation. However, independently of the pump pulse duration, we find a nucleation of ferromagnetic domains on an $8\,\text{ps}$ timescale that starts as soon as the successively deposited energy surpasses the site-specific threshold energy. Due to this threshold behaviour the phase transition proceeds considerably faster than predicted by a convolution of the dynamics observed for ultrafast excitation with the long pump pulse duration. This makes long pump pulses generally useful to identify the role of laser-induced non-equilibria and the non-linear threshold behavior of first-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Unlocking ultrastrong high-temperature ceramics: Beyond Equimolar Compositions in High Entropy Nitrides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, increasing compositional complexity and chemical diversity of high entropy alloy ceramics whilst maintaining a stable single-phase solid solution has been a primary design strategy for the development of new ceramics. However, only a handful have shown properties that justify the increased alloying content. Here, we unveil a groundbreaking strategy based on deviation from conventional equimolar composition towards non-equimolar composition space, enabling tuning the metastability level of the supersaturated single-phase solid solution. By employing high-temperature micromechanical testing of refractory metal-based high entropy nitrides, we found that the activation of an additional strengthening mechanism upon metastable phase decomposition propels the yield strength of a non-equimolar nitride at 1000 C to a staggering 6.9 GPa, that is 40 % higher than the most robust equimolar nitride. We show that the inherent instability triggers the decomposition of the solid solution with non-equimolar composition at high temperatures, inducing strengthening due to the coherency stress of a spinodally modulated structure, combined with the lattice resistance of the product solid solution phase. In stark contrast, the strength of equimolar systems, boasting diverse chemical compositions, declines as a function of temperature due to the weakening of the lattice resistance and the absence of other strengthening mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Co-orchestration of Multiple Instruments to Uncover Structure-Property Relationships in Combinatorial Libraries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of automated and autonomous instrumentations brings forth an opportunity for the co-orchestration of multimodal tools, equipped with multiple sequential detection methods, or several characterization tools to explore identical samples. This can be exemplified by the combinatorial libraries that can be explored in multiple locations by multiple tools simultaneously, or downstream characterization in automated synthesis systems. In the co-orchestration approaches, information gained in one modality should accelerate the discovery of other modalities. Correspondingly, the orchestrating agent should select the measurement modality based on the anticipated knowledge gain and measurement cost. Here, we propose and implement a co-orchestration approach for conducting measurements with complex observables such as spectra or images. The method relies on combining dimensionality reduction by variational autoencoders with representation learning for control over the latent space structure, and integrated into iterative workflow via multi-task Gaussian Processes (GP). This approach further allows for the native incorporation of the system's physics via a probabilistic model as a mean function of the GP. We illustrated this method for different modalities of piezoresponse force microscopy and micro-Raman on combinatorial $Sm-BiFeO_3$ library. However, the proposed framework is general and can be extended to multiple measurement modalities and arbitrary dimensionality of measured signals. The analysis code that supports the funding is publicly available at https://github.com/Slautin/2024_Co-orchestration.</description>

      <title>Systematic Improvement of Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations in Transition Metal Oxides: sCI-Driven Wavefunction Optimization for Reliable Band Gap prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of electronic properties of correlated oxides remains a significant challenge for computational theory. Traditional Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+U) frequently encounters limitations in precisely capturing electron correlation, particularly when predicting band gaps. We introduce a systematic methodology to enhance the accuracy of diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations for both ground and excited states, focusing on LiCoO$_2$ as a case study. By employing a selected CI (sCI) approach, we demonstrate the capability to optimize wavefunctions beyond the constraints of single-reference DFT+U trial wavefunctions. We show that the sCI framework enables accurate prediction of band gaps in LiCoO$_2$, closely aligning with experimental values and substantially improving upon traditional computational methods. The study uncovers a nuanced mixed state of $t_{2g}$ a $e_g$ orbitals at the band edges that is not captured by conventional single-reference methods, further elucidating the limitations of PBE+U in describing $d$-$d$ excitations. Our findings advocate for the adoption of beyond-DFT methodologies, such as sCI, to capture the essential physics of excited state wavefunctions in strongly correlated materials. The improved accuracy in band gap predictions and the ability to generate more reliable trial wavefunctions for DMC calculations underscore the potential of this approach for broader applications in the study of correlated oxides. This work not only provides a pathway for more accurate simulations of electronic structures in complex materials but also suggests a framework for future investigations into the excited states of other challenging systems.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle band structure and excitonic optical response in V2O5 bulk and monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic band structure of V$_2$O$_5$ is calculated using an all-electron quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ method, including electron-hole ladder diagrams in the screening of $W$. The optical dielectric function calculated with the Bethe-Salpeter equation exhibits excitons with large binding energy, consistent with spectroscopic ellipsometry data and other recent calculations. Sharp peaks in the direction perpendicular to the layers at high energy are found to be an artifact of the truncation of the numbers of bands included in the BSE calculation of the macroscopic dielectric function. The $\varepsilon_1(\omega=0)$ gives indices of refraction in good agreement with experiment. The excitons are charge transfer excitons with the hole primarily on oxygen and electrons on vanadium, but depending on which exciton, the distribution over different oxygens changes. The exciton wave functions have a spread of about 5-15\AA, with asymmetric character for the electron distribution around the hole depending on which oxygen the hole is fixed at. The monolayer quasiparticle gap increases inversely proportional to interlayer distance once the initial interlayer covalent couplings are removed which is thanks to the long-range nature of the self-energy and the reduced screening in a 2D system. The optical gap on the other hand is relatively independent of interlayer spacing because of the compensation between the self-energy gap shift and the exciton binding energy, both of which are proportional to the screened Coulomb interaction $\hat{W}$. Recent experimental results on very thin layer V$_2$O$_5$ obtained by chemical exfoliation provide experimental support for an increase in gap.</description>

Abstract: Predicting mechanical properties in metal additive manufacturing (MAM) is essential for ensuring the performance and reliability of printed parts, as well as their suitability for specific applications. However, conducting experiments to estimate mechanical properties in MAM processes can be laborious and expensive, and they are often limited to specific materials and processes. Machine learning (ML) methods offer a more flexible and cost-effective approach to predicting mechanical properties based on processing parameters and material properties. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive framework for benchmarking ML models for predicting mechanical properties. We compiled an extensive experimental dataset from over 90 MAM articles and data sheets from a diverse range of sources, encompassing 140 different MAM data sheets. This dataset includes information on MAM processing conditions, machines, materials, and resulting mechanical properties such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus, elongation, hardness, and surface roughness. Our framework incorporates physics-aware featurization specific to MAM, adjustable ML models, and tailored evaluation metrics to construct a comprehensive learning framework for predicting mechanical properties. Additionally, we explore the Explainable AI method, specifically SHAP analysis, to elucidate and interpret the predicted values of ML models for mechanical properties. Furthermore, data-driven explicit models were developed to estimate mechanical properties based on processing parameters and material properties, offering enhanced interpretability compared to conventional ML models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Treatment of Relativistic Effects with Periodic Density Functional Methods: Energies, Gradients, and Stress Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03817v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implementation of an efficient self-consistent field (SCF) method including both scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit interaction in density functional theory (DFT) is presented. We make use of Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) and all integrals are evaluated in real space. Our implementation supports density functional approximations up to the level of meta-generalized gradient approximations (mGGAs) for SCF energies and gradients. The latter can be used to compute the stress tensor and consequently allow us to optimize the cell structure. Considering spin-orbit interaction requires the extension of the standard procedures to a two-component (2c) formalism and a non-collinear approach for open-shell systems. Here, we implemented both the canonical and the Scalmani-Frisch non-collinear DFT formalisms, with hybrid and range-separated hybrid functionals being presently restricted to SCF energies. We demonstrate both efficiency and relevance of spin-orbit effects for the electronic structure of discrete systems and systems periodic in one to three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Observation of giant nonreciprocal charge transport from quantum Hall states in a topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking in quantum materials is of great importance and can lead to nonreciprocal charge transport. Topological insulators provide a unique platform to study nonreciprocal charge transport due to their surface states, especially quantum Hall states under external magnetic field. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal charge transport mediated by quantum Hall states in devices composed of the intrinsic topological insulator Sn-Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S, which is attributed to asymmetric scattering between quantum Hall states and Dirac surface states. A giant nonreciprocal coefficient of up to 2.26*10^5 A^-1 is found. Our work not only reveals the properties of nonreciprocal charge transport of quantum Hall states in topological insulators, but also paves the way for future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-centrosymmetric, transverse structural modulation in SrAl4, and elucidation of its origin in the BaAl4 family of compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At ambient conditions SrAl4 adopts the BaAl4 structure type with space group I4/mmm. It undergoes a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at TCDW = 243 K, followed by a structural transition at TS = 87 K. Temperature-dependent single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) leads to the observation of incommensurate superlattice reflections at q = \sigma c* with \sigma = 0.1116 at 200 K. The CDW has orthorhombic symmetry with the acentric superspace group F222(00sigma)00s, where F222 is a subgroup of Fmmm as well as of I4/mmm. Atomic displacements mainly represent a transverse wave, with displacements that are 90 deg out of phase between the two diagonal directions of the I-centered unit cell, resulting in a helical wave. Small longitudinal displacements are provided by the second harmonic modulation. The orthorhombic phase realized in SrAl4 is similar to that found in EuAl4. Electronic structure calculations and phonon calculations by density functional theory (DFT) have failed to reveal the mechanism of CDW formation. However, DFT reveals that Al atoms dominate the density of states near the Fermi level, thus, corroborating the SXRD measurements. SrAl4 remains incommensurately modulated at the structural transition, where the symmetry lowers from orthorhombic to b-unique monoclinic. We have identified a simple criterion, that correlates the presence of a phase transition with the interatomic distances. Only those compounds XAl4-xGax(X = Ba, Eu, Sr, Ca; 0 &lt; x &lt;4) undergo phase transitions, for which the ratio c/a falls within the narrow range 2.51 &lt; c/a &lt; 2.54.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity emerging from density-wave-like order in a correlated kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity (USC) in a highly correlated kagome system has been theoretically proposed for years, yet the experimental realization is hard to achieve. The recently discovered vanadium-based kagome materials, which exhibit both superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) orders, are nonmagnetic and weakly correlated, thus unlikely host USC as theories proposed. Here we report the discovery of a chromium-based kagome metal, CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, which is contrastingly characterised by strong electron correlations, frustrated magnetism, and characteristic flat bands close to the Fermi level. Under ambient pressure, it undergoes a concurrent structural and magnetic phase transition at 55 K, accompanying with a stripe-like $4a_0$ structural modulation. At high pressure, the phase transition evolves into two transitions, probably associated with CDW and antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave orderings, respectively. These density-wave (DW)-like orders are gradually suppressed with pressure and, remarkably, a superconducting dome emerges at 3.65-8.0 GPa. The maximum of the superconducting transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{c}^{\mathrm{max}}=$ 6.4 K, appears when the DW-like orders are completely suppressed at 4.2 GPa, and the normal state exhibits a non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, reminiscent of USC and quantum criticality in iron-based superconductors. Our work offers an unprecedented platform for investigating possible USC in a correlated kagome system.</description>

      <title>Features of phonon scattering by a spherical pore: molecular dynamics insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is still a gap in understanding phonons scattering by geometrical defects at the nanoscale, and it remains a significant challenge for heat transfer management in nanoscale devices and systems. In this study, we aim to explore the characteristics of phonon scattering by a single pore to gain insights into thermal transport in nanostructures. The paper outlines a methodology for assessing the spatial distribution of the magnitude of the radial, azimuthal, and polar components of the velocity of scattered phonons by a spherical pore. We demonstrated that the size parameter, commonly employed in electromagnetic wave scattering theory, is vital in determining the scattering regime. Specifically, we show that calculated scattering efficiency has the same pattern as one commonly obtained in classical wave scattering theory. However, we found that crystallographic directions are pivotal in shaping the scattering patterns, especially in the regions where scattering patterns are defined by the Mie resonances. This observation holds significance in understanding the influence of phonon coherence on thermal transport in nanostructured materials.</description>

      <title>Alternant Hydrocarbon Diradicals as Optically Addressable Molecular Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-spin molecules allow for bottom-up qubit design and are promising platforms for magnetic sensing and quantum information science. Optical addressability of molecular electron spins has also been proposed in first-row transition metal complexes via optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) mechanisms analogous to the diamond-NV colour centre. However, significantly less progress has been made on the front of metal-free molecules, which can deliver lower costs and milder environmental impacts. At present, most luminescent open-shell organic molecules are $\pi$-diradicals, but such systems often suffer from poor ground-state open-shell characters necessary to realise a stable ground-state molecular qubit. In this work, we use alternancy symmetry to selectively minimise radical-radical interactions in the ground state, generating $\pi$-systems with high diradical characters. We call them m-dimers, referencing the need to covalently link two benzylic radicals at their meta carbon atoms for the desired symmetry. Through a detailed electronic structure analysis, we find that the excited states of alternant hydrocarbon m-diradicals contain important symmetries that can be used to construct ODMR mechanisms leading to ground-state spin polarisation. The molecular parameters are set in the context of a tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical dimer covalently tethered at the meta position, demonstrating the feasibility of alternant m-diradicals as molecular colour centres.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Spin Injection Beyond Regular Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible via conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, {\it optical spin injection} (OSI) beyond the regular Weyl semimetal (WSM), specifically in multi- and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OSI in multi-WSMs can emerge as a frequency-independent quantized response engendered by band linearity and topological charge associated with the node. Interestingly, the frequency independence can be destroyed by going beyond the first-order topological phase where we explicitly show the OSI response is accompanied by peaks for the first-order Weyl nodes while dips for the second-order Weyl nodes. In addition, we elucidate the behavior of OSI in type-II Weyl phases. The predicted signatures of OSI beyond the regular WSM, i.e., multi- and higher-order WSM, could be experimentally exploited, leading us to effectively access as well as distinguish different-order nontrivial Weyl topology.</description>
