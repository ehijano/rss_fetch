      <title>$({\sigma}, {\tau})$-Derivations of Number Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of number rings by considering them as commutative unital $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras. We begin by characterizing all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations and inner $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the ring of algebraic integers of a quadratic number field. Then we characterize all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the ring of algebraic integers $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ of a $p^{\text{th}}$-cyclotomic number field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ ($p$ odd rational prime and $\zeta$ a primitive $p^{\text{th}}$-root of unity). We also conjecture (using SAGE and MATLAB) an \enquote{if and only if} condition for a $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation $D$ on $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ to be inner. We further characterize all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations and inner $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the bi-quadratic number ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{m}, \sqrt{n}]$ ($m$, $n$ distinct square-free rational integers). In each of the above cases, we also determine the rank and an explicit basis of the derivation algebra consisting of all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the number ring.</description>

      <title>Twisted Derivations in Algebraic Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity and $B = A[\theta]$ be an integral extension of $A$. Assume that $B$ is an integral domain with quotient field $\mathbb{K}$ and $\mathbb{E}$ is the minimal splitting field of $\theta$ over $\mathbb{K}$. Suppose $\sigma, \tau: B \rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ are two different ring homomorphisms that fix $A$ element-wise. In this article, we classify all $A$-linear maps $D: B \rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ which are $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations. Consequently, we classify all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations in certain field extensions, algebraic number fields, and their ring of algebraic integers. For the ring of algebraic integers, $O_{\mathbb{K}} = \mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ of the cyclotomic number field $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ ($\zeta$ an $n^{\text{th}}$ primitive root of unity), and a pair $(\sigma, \tau)$ of two different $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra endomorphisms of $O_{\mathbb{K}}$, we conjecture a necessary and sufficient condition for a $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation $D:O_{\mathbb{K}} \rightarrow O_{\mathbb{K}}$ to be inner. This is done for two different forms of $n$: (i) $n = 2^{r}p$ ($r \in \mathbb{N}$ and $p$ an odd rational prime), and (ii) $n=p^{k}$ ($k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $p$ any rational prime). We also conjecture the existence and non-existence of non-zero outer derivations for the above two forms of $n$, thus answering the twisted derivation problem in $O_{\mathbb{K}}$.</description>

      <title>Skew braces: a brief survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our primary focus is on the theory of skew braces, specifically exploring their connection with combinatorial solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. Skew braces have recently emerged as intriguing algebraic structures, and their link to the Yang-Baxter equation adds further depth and significance to their study. Throughout this article, we place particular emphasis on various problems and conjectures that arise within this field. These open questions serve to stimulate further research and investigation, as we strive to enhance our understanding of skew braces and their role in the study of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Compatible Associative Algebras and Some Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A compatible associative algebra is a vector space equipped with two associative multiplication structures that interact in a certain natural way. This article presents the classification of these algebras with dimension less than four, as well as the classifications of their corresponding derivations, centroids, automorphisms, and quasi-centroids. We then characterize a selection of further invariants such as Rota-Baxter operators and second cohomology for some specific examples.</description>

      <title>Ultimate linear block and convolutional codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01491v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Codes considered as structures within unit schemes greatly extends the availability of linear block and convolutional codes and allows the construction of these codes to required length, rate, distance and type. Properties of a code emanate from properties of the unit from which it was derived. %% can thus be constructed and analysed by designating the units whose properties would give the required codes. Orthogonal units, units in group rings, Fourier/Vandermonde units and related units are used to construct and analyse linear block and convolutional codes and to construct these to predefined length, rate, distance and type. Self-dual, dual containing, quantum error-correcting and linear complementary dual codes are constructed for both linear block and convolutional codes. Low density parity check linear block and convolutional codes are constructed with no short cycles in the control matrix.</description>

      <title>Composing Global Optimizers to Reasoning Tasks via Algebraic Objects in Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables analytical construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGO (Composing Global Optimizers). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of monomial potentials, which are ring homomorphism, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global optimizers constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that over-parameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global optimizers such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.
