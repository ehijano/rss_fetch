      <title>An Algorithm for the Decomposition of Complete Graph into Minimum Number of Edge-disjoint Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study methodical decomposition of an undirected, unweighted complete graph ($K_n$ of order $n$, size $m$) into minimum number of edge-disjoint trees. We find that $x$, a positive integer, is minimum and $x=\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ as the edge set of $K_n$ is decomposed into edge-disjoint trees of size sequence $M = \{m_1,m_2,...,m_x\}$ where $m_i\le(n-1)$ and $\Sigma_{i=1}^{x} m_i$ = $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. For decomposing the edge set of $K_n$ into minimum number of edge-disjoint trees, our proposed algorithm takes total $O(m)$ time.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for the Euclidean Bounded Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Bounded Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (BMTSP), a tour for each salesman, that starts and ends at the depot and that respects the bounds on the number of cities that a feasible salesman tour should satisfy, is to be constructed. The objective is to minimize the total length of all tours. Already Euclidean traveling salesman problem is NP-hard. We propose a 3-Phase heuristic algorithm for the Euclidean BMTSP. We tested the algorithm for the 22 benchmark instances and 168 new problem instances that we created. We report 19 best known solutions for the 22 benchmark instances including the 12 largest ones. For the newly created instances, we compared the performance of our algorithm with that of an ILP-solver CPLEX, which was able to construct a feasible solution for 71% of the instances within the time limit of two hours imposed by us. For about 10% of the smallest new instances, CPLEX delivered slightly better solutions, where our algorithm took less than 180 seconds for the largest of these instances. For the remaining 61% of the instances solved by CPLEX, the solutions by our heuristic were, on average, about 21.5% better than those obtained by CPLEX.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Counts to Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a pair of non-isomorphic, bipartite graphs which are not distinguished by counting the number of homomorphisms to any tree. This answers a question raised by Atserias et al. (LICS 2021). In order to establish the construction, we analyse the equivalence relations induced by counting homomorphisms to trees of diameter two and three and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for two graphs to be equivalent. We show that three is the optimal diameter for our construction.</description>

      <title>Sparse High Dimensional Expanders via Local Lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dimensional expanders (HDXs) are a hypergraph generalization of expander graphs. They are extensively studied in the math and TCS communities due to their many applications. Like expander graphs, HDXs are especially interesting for applications when they are bounded degree, namely, if the number of edges adjacent to every vertex is bounded. However, only a handful of constructions are known to have this property, all of which rely on non-trivial algebraic techniques. In particular, no random or combinatorial construction of bounded degree HDXs is known. As a result, our understanding of these objects is limited.
  The degree of an $i$-face in an HDX is the number of $(i+1)$-faces containing it. In this work we construct HDXs whose higher dimensional faces have bounded degree. This is done by giving an elementary and deterministic algorithm that takes as input a regular $k$-dimensional HDX $X$ and outputs another $k$-dimensional HDX $\widehat{X}$ with twice as many vertices. While the degree of vertices in $\widehat{X}$ grows, the degree of the $(k-1)$-faces in $\widehat{X}$ stays the same. As a result, we obtain a new `algebra-free' construction of HDXs whose $(k-1)$-face degree is bounded.
  Our algorithm is based on a simple and natural generalization of the construction by Bilu and Linial (Combinatorica, 2006), which build expanders using lifts coming from edge signings. Our construction is based on local lifts of HDXs, where a local lift is a complex whose top-level links are lifts of links in the original complex. We demonstrate that a local lift of an HDX is an HDX in many cases.
  In addition, combining local lifts with existing bounded degree constructions creates new families of bounded degree HDXs with significantly different links than before. We use this technique to construct bounded degree high dimensional expanders with links that have arbitrarily large diameters.</description>

      <title>Derandomized Non-Abelian Homomorphism Testing in Low Soundness Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a randomness-efficient homomorphism test in the low soundness regime for functions, $f: G\to \mathbb{U}_t$, from an arbitrary finite group $G$ to $t\times t$ unitary matrices. We show that if such a function passes a derandomized Blum--Luby--Rubinfeld (BLR) test (using small-bias sets), then (i) it correlates with a function arising from a genuine homomorphism, and (ii) it has a non-trivial Fourier mass on a low-dimensional irreducible representation.
  In the full randomness regime, such a test for matrix-valued functions on finite groups implicitly appears in the works of Gowers and Hatami [Sbornik: Mathematics '17], and Moore and Russell [SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics '15]. Thus, our work can be seen as a near-optimal derandomization of their results. Our key technical contribution is a "degree-2 expander mixing lemma'' that shows that Gowers' $\mathrm{U}^2$ norm can be efficiently estimated by restricting it to a small-bias subset. Another corollary is a "derandomized'' version of a useful lemma due to Babai, Nikolov, and Pyber [SODA'08].</description>

      <title>On the Small Quasi-kernel conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An independent vertex subset $S$ of the directed graph $G$ is a kernel if the set of out-neighbors of $S$ is $V(G)\setminus S$. An independent vertex subset $Q$ of $G$ is a quasi-kernel if the union of the first and second out-neighbors contains $V(G)\setminus S$ as a subset. Deciding whether a directed graph has a kernel is an NP-hard problem. In stark contrast, each directed graph has quasi-kernel(s) and one can be found in linear time. In this article, we will survey the results on quasi-kernel and their connection with kernels. We will focus on the small quasi-kernel conjecture which states that if the graph has no vertex of zero in-degree, then there exists a quasi-kernel of size not larger than half of the order of the graph. The paper also contains new proofs and some new results as well.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the task of enumerating (and counting) locally and globally minimal defensive alliances in graphs. We consider general graphs as well as special graph classes. From an input-sensitive perspective, our presented algorithms are mostly optimal.</description>
