      <title>Obstructions to Reality: Torsors &amp; Visual Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual paradoxes like the Penrose staircase present a fundamental tension: locally coherent geometric relationships that cannot be realized globally. Inspired by Penrose's observations connecting such paradoxes to cohomology, we develop a mathematical framework that precisely characterizes this phenomenon through network torsors and sheaf cohomology. Network torsors capture the essential nature of visual paradoxes by formalizing relative geometric attributes (height changes, orientation flips) without requiring absolute measures. We demonstrate that a significant class of visual paradoxes can be rigorously characterized as non-trivial network torsors, with their obstruction to global consistency quantified by elements of $H^1$. This framework enables analysis of classical paradoxes and construction of novel examples on various topological spaces. Key contributions include: (1) the first nonabelian visual paradox, classified by an infinite dihedral torsor on a Klein bottle; (2) paradoxes driven by boundary conditions rather than loops, analyzable via non-constant structure sheaves; and (3) a categorical framework for comparing paradoxes that reveals unexpected connections between visually distinct figures. Our approach unifies diverse visual paradoxes under a single mathematical principle: the obstruction to globalizing locally consistent geometric relationships.</description>

      <title>Coarse cone quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coarse motive of the quotient $\mathcal{O}^{\infty}(X)//G$ of the cone of a uniform bornological coarse space $X$ with $G$-action. If $X$ admits a sufficiently ergodic probability measure, then we show that the coarse assembly map for $\mathcal{O}^{\infty}(X)//G$ is not an equivalence. The main ideas are taken from a recent paper by C. Kitsios, T. Schick and F. Vigolo (arXiv:2504.21811) and adapted to the formalism of coarse homotopy theory based on bornological coarse spaces developed by A. Engel and the author.</description>

      <title>The Szczarba map and the cubical cobar construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a twisting function from a 1-reduced simplicial set $X$ to a simplicial group $G$. We prove in detail that the associated Szczarba operators induce a simplicial map from the triangulation of the cubical cobar construction of $X$ to $G$. This confirms a result due to Minichiello-Rivera-Zeinalian and gives, as pointed out by these authors, a conceptual proof of the fact that the dga map $\Omega\,C(X) \to C(G)$ induced by Szczarba's twisting cochain is comultiplicative.</description>

      <title>Burnside rings for racks and quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We restructure and advance the classification theory of finite racks and quandles by employing powerful methods from transformation groups and representation theory, especially Burnside rings. These rings serve as universal receptacles for those invariants of racks and quandles that are additive with respect to decompositions. We present several fundamental results regarding their structure, including additive bases and multiplicative generators. We also develop a theory of marks, which is analogous to counting fixed points of group actions and computing traces in character theory, and which is comprehensive enough to distinguish different elements in the Burnside rings. The new structures not only offer a fresh framework for the classification theory of finite racks and quandles but also equip us with tools to develop these ideas and create interfaces that strengthen connections with related areas of algebra. For example, they extend the Dress--Siebeneicher theory of the Burnside ring of the infinite cyclic group beyond the realm of permutation racks.</description>

      <title>Higher (equivariant) topological complexity of Milnor manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: J. Milnor introduced a specific class of codimension-$1$ submanifolds in the product of projective spaces, known as Milnor manifolds. This paper establishes precise bounds on the higher topological complexity of these manifolds and provides exact values for this invariant for numerous Milnor manifolds. Furthermore, we improve the upper bounds on the higher equivariant topological complexity. As an application, we obtain sharper bounds on the higher equivariant topological complexity of Milnor manifolds with free $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $S^1$-actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we generalize the main structure theorems of rational homotopy theory to the persistent setting. Our main motivation is the computation of an explicit finite, cellular presentation of the persistent minimal model that completely characterizes the rational homotopy type of copersistent simply-connected spaces. We achieve this via an explicit construction of the minimal model of a tame persistent CDGA as an iterated sequence of cell attachments. As an application of our results, we construct an explicit decomposition of the rational Postnikov tower of simply-connected copersistent spaces in terms of a tower of persistent Eilenberg-Maclane intervals</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthetic analogue functor $\nu$ from spectra to synthetic spectra does not preserve all limits. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient criterion for $\nu$ to preserve the global sections of a derived stack. Even when these conditions are not satisfied, our framework still yields synthetic spectra that implement the descent spectral sequence for the structure sheaf, thus placing descent spectral sequences on good footing in the $\infty$-category of synthetic spectra. As an example, we introduce a new $\mathrm{MU}$-synthetic spectrum $\mathrm{Smf}$.</description>

      <title>Gromov--Hausdorff Distance for Directed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov--Hausdorff distance measures the similarity between two metric spaces by isometrically embedding them into an ambient metric space. In this work, we introduce an analogue of this distance for metric spaces endowed with directed structures. The directed Gromov--Hausdorff distance measures the distance between two extended metric spaces, where the new metric, defined on the same underlying space, is induced by the length of zigzag paths. This distance is then computed by isometrically embedding the directed metric spaces into an ambient directed space equipped with the zigzag distance. Analogously to the standard Gromov--Hausdorff distance, we also propose alternative formulations based on the distortion of d-maps and d-correspondences. However, unlike the classical case, these directed distances are not equivalent.</description>

      <title>$K(2)$-local splittings of finite Galois extensions of $MU\langle6\rangle$ and $MString$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a Milnor-Moore argument we show that, $K(2)$-locally at the prime $2$, the spectra $MU\langle 6\rangle$ and $MString$ split as direct sums of Morava $E$-theories after tensoring with a finite Galois extension of the sphere called $E^{hF_{3/2}}$. In the case of $MString$ we are able to refine this splitting in several ways: we show that the projection maps are determined by spin characteristic classes, that the Ando-Hopkins-Rezk orientation admits a unital section after tensoring with $E^{hF_{3/2}}$, and that the splitting can be improved to one of $E^{hH}\otimes MString$ into a direct sum of shifts of $TMF_0(3)$ where $H$ is an open subgroup of the Morava stabilizer group of index $4$.</description>

      <title>Projective symmetries of three-dimensional TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory has various projective characteristics which are captured by what are called anomalies. This paper explores this idea in the context of fully-extended three-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs).
  Given a three-dimensional TQFT (valued in the Morita 3-category of fusion categories), the anomaly identified herein is an obstruction to gauging a naturally occurring orthogonal group of symmetries. In other words, the classical symmetry group almost acts: There is a lack of coherence at the top level. This lack of coherence is captured by a "higher (central) extension" of the orthogonal group, obtained via a modification of the obstruction theory of Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik-Meir [ENO10]. This extension tautologically acts on the given TQFT/fusion category, and this precisely classifies a projective (equivalently anomalous) TQFT. We explain the sense in which this is an analogue of the classical spin representation. This is an instance of a phenomenon emphasized by Freed [Fre23]: Quantum theory is projective.
  We also establish a general relationship between the language of projectivity/anomalies and the language of topological symmetries. We also identify a universal anomaly associated with any theory which is appropriately "simple".</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood. Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum -observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces. Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A Homotopical Invariant of Weinstein Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One generally expects that the techniques of arboreal singularities and gluing of local differential graded categories will result in a useful global invariant for all Weinstein manifolds. In this paper we construct explicit models for the homotopy limits of diagrams of microlocal sheaf categories which arise from Weinstein surfaces with arboreal skeleta. This is done by characterizing all relevant Reedy model structures on the categories of diagrams that we care about. We prove invariance using a complete set of moves for Weinstein homotopies in this setting. Finally we give combinatorial presentations of the invariant for all topological surfaces.</description>
