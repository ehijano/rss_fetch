      <title>Creating mixed-phase states in cadmium sulfide by swift heavy ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CdS has broad applications in solar cells and radiation detectors. We study its response to irradiation with swift heavy ions and determine its damage thresholds. We apply a model combining the Monte Carlo code TREKIS-3 to simulate the kinetics of the electronic system and the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS to track the atomic reaction to the energy transfer. It is found that ion tracks in CdS differ between its zincblende and wurtzite phases in morphology and damage thresholds. The anisotropic wurtzite phase displays directional damage formation with transient hexagonal track shapes along the (001) plane. In contrast, zincblende CdS exhibits a more cylindrical damage distribution. High pressures near the ion path drive mass transport away from the melted region, forming cavities within the track core in the wurtzite phase. Although significant recrystallization is observed during post-irradiation relaxation, it does not fully restore the original phase: final tracks consist of the amorphous cores due to the low densities in this region and defect-containing crystalline halos. These findings suggest that ion irradiation could be used to create mixed-phase CdS-based materials.</description>

      <title>Silk: A promising natural blend of amino acids for efficient CO2 capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, various highly porous solid sorbents have drawn a significant research interest as promising carbon capture material. Nevertheless, the issues of high synthesis cost, limited CO2 adsorption capacity, slow adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain challenges to overcome before their practical implementation. Herein, natural silk fibroin, a blend of various amino acids, could be a promising material to realize low-cost carbon capture technology due to its amine-like CO2 capture behavior, light weight, natural abundance, scalable processing, and biocompatibility. The mulberry silk-derived silk-fibroin aerogel with a high specific surface area demonstrates high CO2 adsorption capacity (~3.65 mmol CO2/gm sorbent at 0.15 atm CO2), which is competitive with state-of-the-art solid sorbents and surpasses all amino acid-based solid sorbents. The thermogravimetry analysis reveals that the thermal degradation temperature of silk-fibroin aerogel is around 250 oC, significantly higher than conventional amines used for carbon capture. Furthermore, the silk-fibroin-based sorbent demonstrates rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, complete regeneration at a temperature as low as 60 oC, promising stability over multiple adsorption-desorption cycles, and maintaining its adsorption capacity under humid conditions. Overall, this study highlights natural silk's promising carbon capture potential, which is demanding further exploration.</description>

      <title>{\alpha}-Ta (111) Thin Films for Qubit Applications: A Study of Thickness Dependence and Universal Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the growth of {\alpha}-Ta thin films ranging from ultra-thin (2 nm) to thick (250 nm) films grown by sputter epitaxy on c-plane sapphire substrates. We utilized 100 W power with a 32 mTorr sputter pressure at 650 {\deg} substrate deposition temperature. We used X-ray diffractometry to extract the lattice constant and growth orientation of the films, finding a mono-oriented (111) films with a lattice spacing in agreement with a bulk Ta value of 3.31 {\AA}. X-ray reflectometry is used to characterize the native oxide, film, and substrate-film interface as a function of thickness. We observe a very smooth morphology with an average roughness of 700 pm, as determined by both reflectometry and atomic force microscopy. The film nucleates with small islands, whose terrace width grows linearly as a function of thickness until 150 nm, where the terrace width becomes constant. From our reflectometry measurements, we uncover a pseudomorphic layer with a critical thickness of 1 nm and a self-limiting amorphous oxide that grows to a thickness of 2.25 nm; both of these layers are independent of thickness beyond 4 nm total thickness. We also studied the superconducting transition through electronic transport measurements using the Van der Pauw method to measure resistivity as a function of temperature. We observed a smooth evolution in critical superconducting temperature with total film thickness, from 2.9 {\deg}K for 7.5 nm to 4.2 {\deg}K for 269.2 nm, as expected from universal thickness scaling in superconductors. Density functional theory simulations were used to understand the oxidation process at the top surface layers of {\alpha}-Ta (111). We observed that as the oxygen content on the surface increases, the Ta progressively loses its crystalline structure. Significant structural distortions occur when the Ta:O ratio exceeds 1:1, forming an amorphous TaO phase.</description>

      <title>Quantitative approaches for multi-scale structural analysis with atomic resolution electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-resolution imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing the nanoscale structure of materials, in particular features such as defects, local strains, and symmetry-breaking distortions. In addition to advanced instrumentation, the effectiveness of the technique depends on computational image analysis to extract meaningful features from complex datasets recorded in experiments, which can be complicated by the presence of noise and artifacts, small or overlapping features, and the need to scale analysis over large representative areas. Here, we present image analysis approaches which synergize real and reciprocal space information to efficiently and reliably obtain meaningful structural information with picometer scale precision across hundreds of nanometers of material from atomic-resolution electron microscope images. Damping superstructure peaks in reciprocal space allows symmetry-breaking structural distortions to be disentangled from other sources of inhomogeneity and measured with high precision. Real space fitting of the wave-like signals resulting from Fourier filtering enables absolute quantification of lattice parameter variations and strain, as well as the uncertainty associated with these measurements. Implementations of these algorithms are made available as an open source Python package.</description>

      <title>Computational Study of Density Fluctuation-Induced Shear Bands Formation in Bulk Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seemingly identical Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMG) often exhibit strikingly different mechanical properties despite having the same composition and fictive temperature. A postulated mechanism underlying these differences is the presence of "defects". Here we investigate this hypothesis through the study of the effect of density fluctuations on shear band formation under an applied stress. We find that the critical shear stress is strongly dependent on the magnitude and size of the fluctuations. This finding also elucidates why, historically, critical shear stresses obtained in simulations have differed so much from those found experimentally, as typical simulations setups might favor unrealistically uniform geometries.</description>

      <title>TCNQ self-assembly driven by molecular coverage over borophene monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron monolayers, also known as borophene, have recently attracted interest due to their electronic properties, e.g. the facility to form various allotropes with interesting properties. In this work, we investigate the adsorption process of the tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) on the borophene $\beta_{12}$ and $\chi_3$ using the density functional theory (DFT). We observed that molecules bond to the borophene layer through the van der Waals interaction, where, at the low coverage limit, the binding strength of TCNQ / borophene is comparable to that of TCNQ / WSe$_2$. By increasing the molecular coverage, $10^{13} \rightarrow 10^{14}$ molecules/cm$^{2}$, we found the (exothermic) formation of self-assembled (SA) structures of TCNQ on borophene, where the molecule-molecule interactions rule the SA process. The structural stability of the SA-TCNQ molecule on borophene was verified via ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we show that the formation of the vdW interface leads to the tunability of the hole-doping of the borophene layer by an external electric field. We believe that our results bring an important contribution to the atomic-scale understanding of a powerful electron acceptor molecule, TCNQ, adsorbed on a promising 2D material, borophene.</description>

      <title>Energy Bands and Breakdown Characteristics in Al2O3/UWBG AlGaN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (&gt; 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be &gt; 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics and materials science, due to their unique electronic and topological properties. These characteristics not only deepen our understanding of fundamental quantum phenomena, but also make Weyl semimetals promising candidates for advanced applications in electronics, photonics, and spintronics. This review provides a systematic overview of the field, covering theoretical foundations, material synthesis, engineering strategies, and emerging device applications. We first outline the key theoretical principles and distinctive properties of Weyl semimetals, followed by an examination of recent advancements that enhance their functional versatility. Finally, we discuss the critical challenges hindering their practical implementation and explore future development directions, along with the potential for expanding and enhancing their existing range of applications. By integrating discussions of both opportunities and obstacles, this review offers a balanced perspective on current progress and future directions in Weyl semimetal research.</description>

      <title>Robustness of ferromagnetism in van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ to hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT) holds a great potential for applications in spintronic devices, due to its high Curie temperature, easy tunability, and excellent structural stability in air. Theoretical studies have shown that pressure, as an external parameter, significantly affects its ferromagnetic properties. In this study, we have performed comprehensive high-pressure neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiments on FGT up to 5 GPa, to investigate the evolution of its structural and magnetic properties with hydrostatic pressure. The NPD data clearly reveal the robustness of the ferromagnetism in FGT, despite of an apparent suppression by hydrostatic pressure. As the pressure increases from 0 to 5 GPa, the Curie temperature is found to decrease monotonically from 225(5) K to 175(5) K, together with a dramatically suppressed ordered moment of Fe, which is well supported by the first-principles calculations. Although no pressure-driven structural phase transition is observed up to 5 GPa, quantitative analysis on the changes of bond lengths and bond angles indicate a significant modification of the exchange interactions, which accounts for the pressure-induced suppression of the ferromagnetism in FGT.</description>

      <title>Decoupled anisotropic Charge-Phonon Transport Enables Exceptional n-Type Thermoelectric Performance in CuBiSCl$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles calculations demonstrate an exceptional decoupling of charge and thermal transport along the \textit{a}-axis in CuBiSCl$_2$. The material achieves superior electron mobility (138 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s at 300 K) through delocalized Bi-6\textit{p}/S-3\textit{p} networks while maintaining ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (0.40 W/mK at 300 K) via Cu-dominated anharmonic phonon scattering - both optimized along the same crystallographic direction. This simultaneous optimization originates from the anisotropic bonding hierarchy where [BiSCl$_2$]$_n$ ribbons enable efficient charge transport along \textit{a}-axis, while the soft vibrational modes associated with Cu atoms strongly scatter heat-carrying phonons. The resulting high power factor (1.71 mW/mK$^2$ at 700 K) and peak \textit{ZT} of 1.57 establish CuBiSCl$_2$ as a model system that realizes the long-sought "phonon glass-electron crystal" paradigm through crystallographically engineered transport channels.</description>

      <title>Topological delocalization against Anderson localization observed in Bi-doped PbSb2Te4 disordered topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the tendency of localization in the bulk and the topological surface states in topological insulators Pb(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 (x=0.793-0.818) through detailed transport measurements. The bulk electronic states in the range 0.793&lt;=x&lt;0.818 are situated on the insulator side of the Anderson transition, as indicated by k_Fl values (where k_F is the Fermi wavenumber and l is the mean free path) falling below the Ioffe-Regel criterion (i.e., k_F l&lt;1). In contrast, the topological surface states retain high mobility and even exhibit quantum oscillations, demonstrating their resilient nature against strong disorder. These findings highlight the delocalized nature of the topological surface states despite Anderson localization of the bulk electronic states.</description>

      <title>Temperature and misorientation-dependent austenite nucleation at ferrite grain boundaries in a medium manganese steel: role of misorientation-dependent grain boundary segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current work, we study the role of grain boundary (GB) misorientation-dependent segregation on austenite nucleation in a 50% cold rolled intercritically annealed 10Mn-0.05C-1.5Al (wt. %) medium Mn steel. During intercritical annealing at 500{\deg}C, austenite nucleates predominantly at high-angle GBs. At 600{\deg}C, austenite nucleates additionally at low-angle GBs, exhibiting a temperature dependance. Correlative transmission Kikuchi diffraction /atom probe tomography reveals a misorientation-dependent segregation. While GB segregation has been reported to assist austenite nucleation in medium manganese steels (3-12 wt.% Mn), an understanding of the temperature and misorientation dependance is lacking, which is the aim of current work. Since artifacts of atom probe can cause a broadening of the segregation width, we combined experiments with results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations that reveal that the Mn segregation is not limited to the GB plane but confined to a region in the range of approximately 1 nm. Consequently, GB segregation alters both the GB interface energy and the free energy per unit volume corresponding to the transformation. We estimate the local driving force for austenite nucleation accounting for the segregation width of ~ 1 nm. Based on classical nucleation theory, we clarify the effect of GB segregation on the critical radius and activation energy barrier for confined austenite nucleation at the GB.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Dual-Band Emission in Sb-Doped Rare-Earth Phosphates Revealed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sb$^{3+}$ ion has garnered significant interest due to its effectiveness in boosting the optical properties of host materials. Among the interesting phenomena is the commonly observed dual-band emission, which has often been interpreted by adopting the phenomenological model that explains the dual-band emission (``ultraviolet band'' and ``visible band'') in Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$ ($L$ = Sc, Y, Lu). However, the model for Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$ series itself has not been well understood theoretically. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations combined with group-theory analysis to clarify the underlying physical mechanism behind dual-band emission in Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$ series. We demonstrate that the dual-band arises from two excited-state equilibrium structures, one exhibits a relatively small distortion with respect to the ground-state equilibrium structure, while the other displays a significantly larger distortion, characteristic of an ``off-center'' configuration. The deviations from the ground-state configuration are dominated by two distinct vibrational modes, $b_2$ and $e$ modes, involving the Jahn-Teller effect and the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect, respectively. Furthermore, charge transition levels and energy barriers calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method have aided in understanding the relaxation between the two excited-state configurations and the property changes across the Sc, Y, and Lu series. These insights provide a basis for understanding the exotic properties of Sb$^{3+}$ in other hosts and may facilitate the design of optical materials in a broader range of systems involving Sb$^{3+}$ ions.</description>

Abstract: Most ceramic materials are known for high fracture toughness while reacting highly brittle to physical deformation. Some advancements were made by utilizing the transformation toughening effect of Yttria-doped Zirconia. However, finding a ceramic material demonstrating an effect analogous to the Shape Memory Effect (SME) in certain metals, that also allows for superelastic responses, remains a challenge. The underlying mechanism for SME and superelasticity is based on crystallographic variations within the material's grains, requiring sophisticated electron microscopy techniques for direct observation. The combination of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with focused ion beam (FIB) milling, a Kleindiek Nanotechnik GmbH micro-manipulator with a 1.5 $\mu$m diamond tip, and the ability to achieve in-situ heating up to 450 {\deg}C on a Kleindiek heating stage provides a robust platform for the preparation, deformation, and heating of micro-pillars made from ceramic materials. This setup enabled us to conduct detailed studies on the Zirconia-based ceramic, observing permanent deformation exceeding 4% strain, followed by shape recovery at 370 {\deg}C. The paper provides outlines the key experimental steps that facilitated these observations.</description>

      <title>Laser Annealing of Transparent ZnO Thin Films: A Route to Improve Electrical Conductivity and Oxygen Sensing Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical deposition of high-performance Zinc Oxide (ZnO) thin films is challenging, thus significant efforts have been devoted during the past decades to develop cost-effective, scalable fabrication methods in gas phase. This work demonstrates how ultra-short-pulse Laser Beam Scanning (LBS) can be used to modulate electrical conductivity in ZnO thin films deposited on soda-lime glass by Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition (SALD), a high-throughput, low-temperature deposition technique suitable for large-area applications. By systematically optimizing laser parameters, including pulse energy and hatching distance, significant improvements in the electrical performance of 90 nm-thick ZnO films were achieved. The optimization of the laser annealing parameters, 0.21 uJ/pulse energy and a 1 micron hatching distance, yielded ZnO films with an electrical resistivity of (9 +- 2) 10-2 Ohm cm, 3 orders of magnitude lower than as deposited films. This result suggests that laser post-deposition-processing can play an important role in tailoring the properties of ZnO thin films. Excessive laser intensity can compromise structural integrity of the films, however, degrading their electrical transport properties. Notably, the electrical resistance of laser-annealed ZnO films exhibited high sensitivity to oxygen concentration in the surrounding atmosphere, suggesting exciting prospects for application in devices based on transparent oxygen sensors. This study thus positions ultra-short pulsed laser annealing as a versatile post-deposition method for fine-tuning the properties of ZnO thin films, enabling their use in advanced optoelectronic and gas-sensing technologies, particularly on temperature-sensitive substrates.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the discovery of high-performance nonlinear optical materials using active learning and high-throughput screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their abundant use in all-solid-state lasers, nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are needed for many applications across diverse fields such as medicine and communication. However, because of conflicting requirements, the design of suitable inorganic crystals with strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) has proven to be challenging to both experimentalists and computational scientists. In this work, we leverage a data-driven approach to accelerate the search for high-performance NLO materials. We construct an extensive pool of candidates using databases within the OPTIMADE federation and employ an active learning strategy to gather optimal data while iteratively improving a machine learning model. The result is a publicly accessible dataset of $\sim$2,200 computed SHG tensors using density-functional perturbation theory. We further assess the performance of machine learning models on SHG prediction and introduce a multi-fidelity correction-learning scheme to refine data accuracy. This study represents a significant step towards data-driven materials discovery in the NLO field and demonstrates how new materials can be screened in an automated fashion.</description>

      <title>Strong Nonlinear Flexoelectricity in Bulk Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity induced by strain gradient in dielectrics is highly desirable for electromechanical actuating and sensing systems. It is broadly adopted that flexoelectric polarization responds linearly to strain gradient without considering nonlinearity. Consequently, the implication of nonlinear flexoelectricity in electromechanical systems remains unclear. Herein, we establish a nonlinear constitutive model for flexoelectricity and thereby propose a strategy for quantitatively measuring its nonlinearity through the high-order harmonic generations. A strong nonlinear flexoelectricity in bulk ferroelectrics is revealed and its coefficient is determined, as evidenced by their nonlinear dependence of harmonics on strain gradient. On this basis, we illustrate the nonlinear flexoelectricity manifests a functionality to transduce mixed mechanical excitations into coherent electrical signals featuring difference- and sum-frequencies, thereby offering utilization in signal processing for frequency conversion. These findings emphasize the significance of nonlinear flexoelectricity in ferroelectrics and open up new opportunities for designing electromechanical transducer based on nonlinear flexoelectricity.</description>

      <title>KTaO3(001) Preparation Methods in Vacuum: Effects on Surface Stoichiometry, Crystallography, and in-gap States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KTaO3 single crystals with different orientations are used as substrates for the epitaxial growth of thin films and/or as hosts for two-dimensional electron gases. Due to the polar nature of the KTaO3(001) surface, one can expect difficulties and challenges to arise in its preparation. Maintaining good insulating characteristics without adding undesirable in-gap electronic states, obtaining good crystalline order up to the top surface layer, a sufficiently flat surface, and complete cleanliness of the surface (without water, C or OH contaminants), are in general difficult conditions to accomplish simultaneously. Cleaving in vacuum is likely the best option for obtaining a clean surface. However, since KTaO3 is cubic and lacks a well-defined cleavage plane, this method is notsuitable for sample growth or reproducible device fabrication. Here, we systematically evaluate the effect of typical preparation methods applied on the surfaces of KTaO3(001) single crystals. In particular, we used annealing in vacuum at different temperatures, light sputtering with Ar+ ions at low energy (500 eV) followed by annealing, heavy Ar+ ion bombardment and annealing, and grazing Ar+ ion bombardment under continuous azimuthal rotation combined with both annealing in vacuum and in O2 atmosphere. Possible side effects after each treatment are evaluated by a combination of techniques, including low-energy ion scattering at forward angles, Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy electron energy loss, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and time of flightsecondary ion mass spectrometry. Advantages and shortcomings of each preparation method are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Horizons of Phase Transition-Based Luminescence Thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited operational range of phase transition-based luminescence thermometers necessitates the exploration of new host materials exhibiting first-order structural phase transitions to broaden the applicability of this approach. Addressing this need, the present study investigates the spectroscopic properties of as a function of temperature. A thermally induced structural transition from the low-temperature orthorhombic phase to the high-temperature trigonal phase, occurring at approximately 430 K, significantly alters the spectroscopic properties of Eu3 ions. Specifically, a reduction in the number of Stark lines due to changes in the point symmetry of Eu3 ions enables the development of a ratiometric luminescence thermometer with sensitivity as high as K. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that increasing the concentration of Eu3 ions shifts the phase transition temperature, allowing for modulation of the thermometric performance of this luminescence thermometer. The findings presented here not only expand the repertoire of phase transition-based luminescence thermometers but also illustrate how the luminescence properties of Eu3 ions can be employed to accurately monitor structural changes in the host material.</description>

      <title>High-Chern-number Quantum anomalous Hall insulators in mixing-stacked MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators are characterized by vanishing longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance in the absence of an external magnetic field. Among them, high-Chern-number QAH insulators offer multiple nondissipative current channels, making them crucial for the development of low-power-consumption electronics. Using first-principles calculations, we propose that high-Chern-number ($C&gt;1$) QAH insulators can be realized in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) multilayer films through the combination of mixed stacking orders, eliminating the need for additional buffer layers. The underlying physical mechanism is validated by calculating real-space-resolved anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). Local AHC is found to be predominantly located in regions with consecutive correct stacking orders, contributing to quasi-quantized AHC. Conversely, regions with consecutive incorrect stacking contribute minimally to the total AHC, which can be attributed to the varied interlayer coupling in different stacking configurations. Our work provides valuable insights into the design principle for achieving large Chern numbers, and highlights the role of stacking configurations in manipulating electronic and topological properties in MBT films and its derivatives.</description>

      <title>NIR-to-NIR ratiometric and lifetime based luminescence thermometer on a structural phase transition in Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Yb3+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ratiometric approach is the most commonly employed readout technique in luminescence thermometry. To address the trade-off between the risk of measurement disturbance in thermometers with high spectral separation of emission bands (due to dispersion in the surrounding medium) and the low sensitivity observed in ratiometric thermometers based on Stark level thermalization, we propose a thermometer based on the structural phase transition in . The use of Yb3+ ions as dopants and the changes in Stark level energies associated with the thermally induced monoclinic-to-trigonal phase transition enable the development of a thermometer with high relative sensitivity, achieving at 340K for N. Additionally, as demonstrated, the structural transition alters the probability of radiative depopulation of the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+, allowing the development of a lifetime-based luminescence thermometer. Furthermore, the phase transition temperature and consequently the thermometric performance of can be modulated by varying the Yb3+ ion concentration, offering additional tunability for specific applications.</description>

      <title>Controlling photo-excited electron-spin by light-polarization in ultrafast-pumped altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) constitute a novel class of spin-compensated materials in which the symmetry connecting opposite-spin sublattices involves a spatial rotation. Here, we uncover a set of unique non-linear, light-driven properties that set AMs apart from traditional ferro- and antiferromagnets. We demonstrate theoretically that the polarization of an electromagnetic pulse that photo-excites electrons and holes in an AM, controls the spin orientation of these non-equilibrium charge carriers. For a d-wave AM model and a prototype material, we show that very large post-pump spin polarizations may be attained by exploiting resonances. We show that this protocol also allows, in an AM, to directly probe the spin splitting of the electronic states in energy and momentum space. Thus, it can be used to identify and characterize altermagnetic materials via ultrafast pump-probe Kerr/Faraday spectroscopy or spin- and time-resolved ARPES. This opens up the possibility of devising ultrafast optical switches of non-equilibrium spin-polarization, finely tunable by adjusting the pump-pulse characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density function theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure theory. However, its accuracy in practical calculations is limited by the choice of the exchange-correlation potential. In this respect, 2D materials pose a special challenge, as all 2D materials and their heterostructures have a crucial similarity. The underlying atomic structures are strongly spatially inhomogeneous, implying that current exchange-correlation functionals, that in almost all cases are isotropic, are ill-prepared for an accurate description. We present an anisotropic screened-exchange potential, that remedies this problem and reproduces the band-gap of 2D materials as well as the piecewise linearity of the total energy with fractional occupation number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the spatial arrangement of optically active elements is crucial for the advancement of engineered photonic systems. Color centers in nanodiamond offer unique advantages for quantum sensing and information processing; however, their integration into complex optical architectures is limited by challenges in precise and reproducible positioning, as well as efficient coupling. DNA origami provides an elegant solution, as demonstrated by recent studies showcasing nanoscale positioning of fluorescent nanodiamonds and plasmonic gold nanoparticles. Here, we present a scalable and robust method for covalently functionalizing nanodiamonds with DNA, enabling high-yield, spatially controlled assembly of diamond and gold nanoparticles onto DNA origami. By precisely controlling the interparticle spacing, we reveal distance-dependent modulation of NV center photoluminescence with a 10-fold increase in the fastest decay pathway at short interparticle distances. Our findings indicate selective plasmon-driven effects and interplay between radiative and non-radiative processes. This work overcomes key limitations in current nanodiamond assembly strategies and provides insights into engineering NV photoluminescence by plasmonic coupling that advance toward quantum photonic and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>A quantitative theory and atomistic simulation study on the soft-sphere crystal-melt interfacial properties: II. Interfacial free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new method for predicting the crystal-melt interfacial free energy ($\gamma$) using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model, enhanced by atomistic simulation data for more accurate density wave profiles. The analysis focuses on the soft-sphere system governed by an inverse power potential that stabilizes both BCC and FCC phases. Equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to obtain density wave amplitude distributions, which serve as inputs for the GL model to predict $\gamma$ and its anisotropy. The predicted $\gamma$ values exhibit strong agreement with prior benchmark simulation experimental studies, particularly for FCC crystal-melt interfaces (CMIs). The GL models for the CMI $\gamma$ are proved to be both computationally efficient and reasonably valid, offering quantitative predictions of $\gamma$ while providing insights into the factors controlling its magnitude and anisotropy. Key improvement is suggested for the variational procedure used in the two-mode CMI free energy functionals, and potential upgrades to the GL model are also proposed to further enhance predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>How to Reliably Measure Carrier Mobility in Highly Resistive Lead Halide Perovskites with Photo-Hall Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility measurements in highly resistive methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) are challenging due to high impedance, ion drift, and low mobility. We show that we can address the challenge using intensity-dependent photo-Hall measurements. The key is an improved photo-Hall setup, which enables reliable Hall measurements in the dark and under low-intensity illumination. By tuning the illumination over four orders of magnitude, we get the additional information to simultaneously extract hole mobility, electron mobility, and background doping. For the first time, we show that a MAPI single crystal, exhibiting n-type behaviour in the dark, can show p-type behaviour under light due to the difference in hole and electron mobility. The data partly explains the variability in mobility reported in the literature. We show that one can erroneously extract any mobility from 0 to 25 cm2/Vs if we restrict the experiment to a small range of illumination intensities. For our MAPI (310) crystal, the measured hole and electron mobility is 40 cm2/Vs and 25.5 cm2/Vs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Composition Design of Shape Memory Ceramics based on Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Gaussian process machine learning model to predict the transformation temperature and lattice parameters of ZrO$_2$-based ceramics. Our overall goal is to search for a shape memory ceramic with a reversible transformation and low hysteresis. The identification of a new low hysteresis composition is based on design criteria that have been successful in metal alloys: (1) $\lambda_2 = 1$, where $\lambda_2$ is the middle eigenvalue of the transformation stretch tensor, (2) minimizing the max$|q(f)|$, which measures the deviation from satisfying the cofactor conditions, (3) high transformation temperature, (4) low transformational volume change, and (5) solid solubility. We generate many synthetic compositions, and identify a promising composition, 31.75Zr-37.75Hf-14.5Y-14.5Ta-1.5Er, which closely satisfies all the design criteria based on predictions from machine learning. However, differential thermal analysis reveals a relatively high thermal hysteresis of 137{\deg}C for this composition, indicating that the proposed design criteria are not universally applicable to all ZrO$_2$-based ceramics. We also explore reducing tetragonality of the austenite phase by addition of Er$_2$O$_3$. The idea is to tune the lattice parameters of austenite phase towards a cubic structure will increase the number of martensite variants, thus, allowing more flexibility for them to accommodate high strain during transformation. We find the effect of Er$_2$O$_3$ on tetragonality is weak due to limited solubility. We conclude that a more effective dopant is needed to achieve significant tetragonality reduction. Overall, Gaussian process machine learning models are shown to be highly useful for prediction of compositions and lattice parameters, but the discovery of low hysteresis ceramic materials apparently involves other factors not relevant to phase transformations in metals.</description>

      <title>Surfactants Screen Slide Electrification</title>

Abstract: Water drops spontaneously accumulate charges when they move on hydrophobic dielectric surfaces by slide electrification. On the one hand, slide electrification generates electricity with possible applications on tiny devices. On the other hand, the potential of up to 1 KV generated by slide electrification alters wetting and drop motion. Therefore, it is important to know the factors that affect slide electrification. To find out how surfactants affect slide electrification, we measured drop charges of aqueous drops containing cationic CTAB, anionic SDS and neutral C8E3 sliding on different hydrophobic surfaces. The result is: addition of surfactant significantly reduces the spontaneous charging of moving water drops. Based on zeta potential measurements, confocal microscopy of deposited surface-active dyes and drop impact studies, we propose that several factors contribute to this suppression of charge separation: (1) Surfactants tend to lower the contact angles, which reduces charge separation. (2) Surfactant adsorption at the solid-liquid interface can reduce the density of primary ions, particularly for anionic surfactants. (3) Anionic and neutral surfactants are mostly transferred to the liquid-air interface at the rear of the sliding drop, retaining primary ions within the drop. (4) Deposited cationic surfactant directly reduces the charge of the drop.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced orbital reordering in Na$_2$CuF$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-pressure behaviour of Na$_2$CuF$_4$ is explored by powder neutron diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A first-order phase transition is observed to take place between 2.4 - 2.9 GPa, involving a reorientation of the Jahn-Teller (JT) long axes of the (CuF6) octahedra (and therefore the d$_{z^2}$ Cu orbitals), in agreement with our DFT calculations which suggest a transition at 2.8 GPa. The transition can be described as being between a state of ferro-orbital order and one of A-type antiferro-orbital order, reflecting a shift in the associated electronic instability from being in the zone-center to zone boundary of the first Brillouin zone of the parent structure, with pressure. This change results in a decoupling of magnitude of the associated Jahn-Teller distortion of the Cu-F bond lengths from the lattice strain. This scenario is supported by our observations that the compressibility of the pre-transition phase is highly anisotropic, whilst in the post-transition phase it becomes almost isotropic, and that we observed no further decrease of the magnitude the JT distortion up to 5 GPa, or melting of the OO in our DFT calculations up to at least 5 GPa.</description>

      <title>Indirect Excitons and Many-body Interactions in InGaAs Double Quantum Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially indirect excitons in semiconductor quantum wells are relevant to basic research and device applications because they exhibit enhanced tunability, delocalized wave functions, and potentially longer lifetimes relative to direct excitons. Here we investigate the properties of indirect excitons and their coupling interactions with direct excitons in asymmetric InGaAs double quantum wells using optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Analyses of the spectra confirm a strong influence of many-body effects, and reveal that excited-state zero-quantum coherences between direct and indirect excitons in the quantum wells dephase faster than the much higher-energy single-quantum coherences between excitonic excited states and ground states. The results also suggest an important energy-dependent role of continuum states in mediating system dynamics, and they indicate that dephasing mechanisms are associated with uncorrelated or anticorrelated energy-level fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Sub-second spin and lifetime-limited optical coherences in $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spins have been extensively studied for quantum technologies, offering unique advantages for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Advancing these applications is generally limited by finding materials that simultaneously provide lifetime-limited optical and long spin coherences. Here, we introduce $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$ ions doped into a CaWO$_4$ crystal. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the excited state, and demonstrate all-optical coherent control of the electron-nuclear spin ensemble. We find narrow inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions of 185 MHz and radiative-lifetime-limited coherence time up to 0.75 ms. Next to this, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and electron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15 seconds at zero magnetic field between 50 mK and 1 K temperatures. These results demonstrate the potential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ as a low-noise platform for building quantum technologies with ensemble-based memories, microwave-to-optical transducers, and optically addressable single-ion spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Scaling in Magnetic Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of scaling in the mesoscale magnetic microstructure of bulk ferromagnets. Supported by analytical micromagnetic theory, we introduce the field-dependent scaling length $l_{\mathrm{C}}(H)$, which describes the characteristic long-wavelength magnetization fluctuations that are caused by microstructural defects by means of magnetoelastic and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The scaling length $l_{\mathrm{C}}$ is identified to consist of the micromagnetic exchange length of the field $l_{\mathrm{H}}$, which depends on the magnetic interactions, and a field-independent contribution that reflects the properties of the magnetic anisotropy field and the magnetostatic fluctuations. The latter finding is rooted in the convolution relationship between the grain microstructure and micromagnetic response functions. We validated the scaling property by analyzing experimental data for the magnetic neutron scattering cross section. When plotted as a function of the dimensionless scaled scattering vector $\mathfrak{q}(H) = q \, l_{\mathrm{C}}(H)$, the field-dependent amplitude-scaled neutron data of nanocrystalline Co and a Nd-Fe-B-based nanocomposite collapse onto a single master curve, demonstrating universal behavior. The scaling length $l_{\mathrm{C}}$ provides a framework for analyzing the field-dependent neutron scattering cross section, highlighting the existence of critical length scales that govern the mesoscale microstructure of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Random Phase Approximation Correlation Energy using Real-Space Density Functional Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a real-space method for computing the random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energy within Kohn-Sham density functional theory, leveraging the low-rank nature of the frequency-dependent density response operator. In particular, we employ a cubic scaling formalism based on density functional perturbation theory that circumvents the calculation of the response function matrix, instead relying on the ability to compute its product with a vector through the solution of the associated Sternheimer linear systems. We develop a large-scale parallel implementation of this formalism using the subspace iteration method in conjunction with the spectral quadrature method, while employing the Kronecker product-based method for the application of the Coulomb operator and the conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient method for the solution of the linear systems. We demonstrate convergence with respect to key parameters and verify the method's accuracy by comparing with planewave results. We show that the framework achieves good strong scaling to many thousands of processors, reducing the time to solution for a lithium hydride system with 128 electrons to around 150 seconds on 4608 processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common mode chokes (CMCs) are conventional circuit elements performing several tasks, including noise suppression, hindering electromagnetic interference, providing signal integrity, and circuit protection. Much as they are widely used, their fundamental construction and description are often qualitative and lack an understanding of the underlying physical principles. We discuss the behavior of a commercial CMC based on the physical description of the superparamagnetic core and parasitic circuit elements. The results are validated using a DC bias current and an external magnetic field, which affect the magnetic properties. The behavior of the CMCs in the strongly non-linear regime is also described.</description>

Abstract: Coherent topologically close-packed nanoplates in magnesium alloys can effectively improve strength and creep resistance.However, the formation mechanisms of several metastable TCP nanoplates remain unclear, and the traditional trial-and-error methods hinder the rapid discovery of novel TCP precipitate strengthened Mg alloys.By integrating the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions for TCP precipitation, we developed a two-step high-throughput screening strategy, identifying 43 previously unreported TCP nanoplates in a series of Mg alloys. These findings highlight the critical need for precise compositional characterization of nanoprecipitates and establish a theoretical framework for designing creep-resistant Mg alloys containing TCP nanoplates.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional Janus ferromagnetic LaBrI with strain-induced valley degeneracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the successful synthesis of the MoSSe monolayer, which violated the out-of-plane mirror symmetry of TMDs monolayers, considerable and systematic research has been conducted on Janus monolayer materials. By systematically analyzing the LaBrI monolayer, we are able to learn more about the novel Janus material by focusing on the halogen family next to group VIA (S, Se, Te). The structural optimizations have been carried out using pseudopotential based Quantum espresso code. Computed structural parameters are in good agreement with literature reports. The optimized crystal structures were used for computing effect of strain on electronic and thermoelectric properties. Dynamical stability predicts that this material can withstand up to 10% of tensile strain. Computed electronic structure reveals material to be indirect wide band gap ferromagnet with magnetic moment 1{\mu}B. With increase in the biaxial tensile strain the band gap decreases. Furthermore, the computed magneto-thermoelectric properties predict high Seebeck coefficient ~ 400 {\mu}V/K and low thermal conductivity of ~ 0.93 W/m.K in LaBrI which results in a high ZT ~ 1.84 for 4% strain at 800 K. The present study supports the fact that tensile strain on ferromagnetic LaBrI material can further enhance TE properties making it to be a promising material for TE applications at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Spin gapped metals: A novel class of materials for multifunctional spintronic devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gapped metals, a recently proposed class of materials, possess a band gap slightly above or below the Fermi level, behaving as intrinsic p- or n-type semiconductors without requiring external doping. Inspired by this concept, we propose a novel material class: "spin gapped metals". These materials exhibit intrinsic p- or n-type character independently for each spin channel, similar to dilute magnetic semiconductors but without the need for transition metal doping. A key advantage of spin gapped metals lies in the absence of band tails that exist within the band gap of conventional p- and n-type semiconductors. Band tails degrade the performance of devices like tunnel field-effect transistors (causing high subthreshold slopes) and negative differential resistance tunnel diodes (resulting in low peak-to-valley current ratios). Here, we demonstrate the viability of spin gapped metals using first-principles electronic band structure calculations on half-Heusler compounds. Our analysis reveals compounds displaying both gapped metal and spin gapped metal behavior, paving the way for next-generation multifunctional devices in spintronics and nanoelectronics.</description>

Abstract: The promise of a strong magnetoelectric coupling in a multiferroic material is not only of fundamental interest, but also forms the basis of next generation memory devices where the direction of magnetization can be reversed by an external electric field. Using group-theory led first-principles calculations, we have identified a hitherto unknown polar phase of the $A_4B_3\rm{O}_9$ layered oxides, where the polar mode couples to the magnetic modes through a rare $\Gamma$-point magnetoelectric-multiferroic coupling scheme such that the net magnetization can be directly reversed by an electric field switching of the polar mode. Furthermore, in agreement with previous experimental observations, we predict room temperature magnetism in $A_4B_3\rm{O}_9$ oxides which indicates the promising practical applications of these compounds in the next generation memory devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CrI3 is a layered ferromagnetic insulator that has recently attracted enormous interest as it was the first example of a stand-alone monolayer ferromagnet, paving the way towards the study of two-dimensional magnetic materials and their use as building blocks of hybrid van der Waals layered heterostructures. Here we go one step down in the dimensionality ladder and report the synthesis and characterization of a tubular one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure where CrI3 nanotubes are encapsulated within multiwall carbon nanotubes, integrating a magnetic insulator and a conductor. By means of the capillary filling of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), we obtained single-wall CrI3 nanotubes with diameters ranging between 2 nm and 10 nm, with an average of 5.3 nm. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy in combination with spectroscopic techniques we confirm the structure and chemical composition of the nanotubes. SQUID measurements, combined with element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) indicate unequivocally that the Cr atoms in encapsulated CrI3 nanotubes are magnetic with a collective state compatible with a radial magnetization state predicted both by first-principles calculations and a model Hamiltonian. Our results represent a step forward in establishing 1D van der Waals heterostructures as a playground for the exploration of non-collinear magnetic states arising from the interplay between magnetic anisotropy and curvature in tubular geometries.</description>

Abstract: Selective excitation of vibrational modes using strong laser pulses has emerged as a powerful material engineering paradigm. However, to realize deterministic control over material properties for device applications, it is desirable to have an analogous scheme without a drive, operating in thermal equilibrium. We here propose such an equilibrium analog of the light-driven paradigm, leveraging the strong coupling between lattice degrees of freedom and the quantum fluctuations of the electric field of a THz micro-cavity. We demonstrate this approach by showing, using ab initio data, how electric field fluctuations can induce a sub-dominant ferromagnetic order, on top of the dominant zig-zag antiferromagnet order, in FePS$_3$ close to its N\'eel temperature.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Epitaxial Laterally Overgrown Diamond: Towards Up-scaling of Color Center-based Quantum Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g., via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds of microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We quantify the effective crystal strain in different regions of the overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction in the diamond layer above the holes.</description>

Abstract: FAPbI$_3$ is a material of interest for its potential in solar cell applications, driven by its remarkable optoelectronic properties. However, the low-temperature phase of FAPbI$_3$ remains poorly understood, with open questions surrounding its crystal structure, octahedral tilting, and the arrangement of formamidinium (FA) cations. Using our trained machine-learned potential in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a detailed investigation of this phase, uncovering its structural characteristics and dynamical behavior. Our analysis reveals the octahedral tilt pattern and sheds light on the rotational dynamics of FA cations in the low temperature phase. Strikingly, we find that the FA cations become frozen in a metastable configuration, unable to reach the thermodynamic ground state. By comparing our simulated results with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra, we demonstrate good agreement, further validating our findings. This phenomenon mirrors experimental observations and offers a compelling explanation for the experimental challenges in accessing the true ground state. These findings provide critical insights into the fundamental physics of FAPbI$_3$ and its low-temperature behavior, advancing our understanding of this technologically important material.</description>

      <title>Understanding process-structure-property relation for elastoplastic behavior of polymer nanocomposites with agglomeration anomalies and gradient interphase percolation</title>

Abstract: For polymer nanocomposites, disordered microstructural nature makes processing control and tailoring properties to desired values a challenge. Understanding process-structure-property relation can provide guidelines for process and constituents design. Our work explores nuances of PSP relation for polymer nanocomposites with attractive pairing between particles and polymer bulk. In the absence of any nano or micro-scale local property measurement, we develop a material model that can represent decay for small strain elastoplastic properties in interfacial regions and simulate representative or statistical volume element behavior. This interfacial model is further combined with a microstructural design of experiments for agglomerated nanocomposite systems. Agglomerations are particle aggregations that are microstructural defects resulting from lack of processing control. Twin screw extrusion process can reduce extent of aggregation in hot pressed samples via erosion or rupture depending on screw rpms and toque. We connect this process-structure relation to structure-property relation that emerges from our study. We discover that balancing between local stress concentration zone and interfacial property decay governs how fast yield stress can improve if we break down agglomeration via erosion. Rupture is relatively less effective in helping improve nanocomposite yield strength. Additionally, we allude to yield initiation and progression in these multiphase materials. We have come up with a field quantity called local yield resistance that indicates balance stress concentration zones and interfacial effects. Yield resistance map from linear regime acts as a predictor of local yielding process and can be a useful tool for interface design for plastic deformation behavior.</description>

      <title>The BPHZL renormalization of a planar quantum electrodynamics up to 2-loops and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.</description>
