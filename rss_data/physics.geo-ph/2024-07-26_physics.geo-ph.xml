      <title>Axisymmetric Dynamos Sustained by Ohm's Law in a Nearly-Spherical Rotating Viscous Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work tackles a significant challenge in dynamo theory: the possibility of long-term amplification and maintenance of an axisymmetric magnetic field. We introduce a novel model that allows for non-trivial axially-symmetric steady-state solutions for the magnetic field, particularly when the dynamo operates primarily within a "nearly-spherical" toroidal volume inside a fluid shell surrounding a solid core. In this model, Ohm's law is generalized to include the restoring friction force, which aligns the velocity of the shell with the rotational speed of the inner core and outer mantle. Our findings reveal that, in this context, Cowling's theorem and the neutral point argument are modified, leading to magnetic energy growth for a suitable choice of toroidal flow. The global equilibrium magnetic field that emerges from our model exhibits a dipolar character.</description>

      <title>HAMSTER: Hyperspectral Albedo Maps dataset with high Spatial and TEmporal Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface albedo is an important parameter in radiative transfer simulations of the Earth's system, as it is fundamental to correctly calculate the energy budget of the planet. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and yearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface Reflectance black-sky albedo dataset (MCD43D, version 6.1) gives detailed albedo maps in seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range. These albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and their seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only in seven spectral bands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength range is required to simulate radiance spectra, and to correctly retrieve atmospheric and cloud properties from Earth's remote sensing. We use a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate hyperspectral albedo maps of Earth. Combining different datasets of hyperspectral reflectance laboratory measurements for various dry soils, vegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct the albedo maps in the entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500~nm. The PCA method is trained with a 10-years average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain hyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05{\deg} in latitude and longitude, a spectral resolution of 10~nm, and a temporal resolution of 1~day. Using the hyperspectral albedo maps, we estimate the spectral profiles of different land surfaces, such as forests, deserts, cities and icy surfaces, and study their seasonal variability. These albedo maps shall enable to refine calculations of Earth's energy budget, its seasonal variability, and improve climate simulations.</description>

      <title>Travel time and energy dissipation minima in heterogeneous subsurface flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a number of results concerning conditions for minimum energy dissipation and advective travel time in porous and fractured media. First, we establish a pair of converse results concerning fluid motion along a streamline between two points of fixed head: the minimal advective time is achieved under conditions of constant energy dissipation, and minimal energy dissipation is achieved under conditions of constant velocity along the streamline (implying homogeneous conductivity in the vicinity of the streamline). We also show directly by means of variational methods that minimum advection time along a streamline with a given average conductivity is achieved when the conductivity is constant. Finally, we turn our attention to minimum advection time and energy dissipation in parallel and sequential fracture systems governed by the cubic law: for which fracture cross-section and conductivity are intimately linked. We show that, as in porous domains, flow partitioning between different pathways always acts to minimize system energy dissipation. Finally, we consider minimum advection time as a function of aperture distribution in a sequence of fracture segments. We show that, for a fixed average aperture, a uniform-aperture system displays the shortest advection time. However, we also show that any sufficiently small small perturbations in aperture away from uniformity always act to reduce advection time.</description>

      <title>DINOv2 Rocks Geological Image Analysis: Classification, Segmentation, and Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the interpretability, classification, and segmentation of CT-scan images of rock samples, with a particular focus on the application of DINOv2 within Geosciences. We compared various segmentation techniques to evaluate their efficacy, efficiency, and adaptability in geological image analysis. The methods assessed include the Otsu thresholding method, clustering techniques (K-means and fuzzy C-means), a supervised machine learning approach (Random Forest), and deep learning methods (UNet and DINOv2). We tested these methods using ten binary sandstone datasets and three multi-class calcite datasets. To begin, we provide a thorough interpretability analysis of DINOv2's features in the geoscientific context, discussing its suitability and inherent ability to process CT-scanned rock data. In terms of classification, the out-of-the-box DINOv2 demonstrates an impressive capability to perfectly classify rock images, even when the CT scans are out of its original training set. Regarding segmentation, thresholding and unsupervised methods, while fast, perform poorly despite image preprocessing, whereas supervised methods show better results. We underscore the computational demands of deep learning but highlight its minimal intervention, superior generalization, and performance without additional image preprocessing. Additionally, we observe a lack of correlation between a network's depth or the number of parameters and its performance. Our results show that a LoRA fine-tuned DINOv2 excels in out-of-distribution segmentation and significantly outperforms other methods in multi-class segmentation. By systematically comparing these methods, we identify the most efficient strategy for meticulous and laborious segmentation tasks. DINOv2 proves advantageous, achieving segmentations that could be described as "better than ground-truth" against relatively small training sets.</description>
