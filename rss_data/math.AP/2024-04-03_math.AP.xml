      <title>Existence and non-existence of ground state solutions for magnetic NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence and stability of ground state solutions (g.s.s.) for $L^2$-critical magnetic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (mNLS) for a class of unbounded electromagnetic potentials. We then give non-existence result by constructing a sequence of vortex type functions in the setting of RNLS with an anisotropic harmonic potential. These generalize the corresponding results in [3] and [20]. The case of an isotropic harmonic potential for rotational NLS has been recently addressed in [10]. Numerical results on the ground state profile near the threshold are also included.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to nonlinear and non-smooth parabolic obstacle problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence, uniqueness, and $W^{1,2,p}$-regularity of solutions to fully nonlinear parabolic obstacle problems when the obstacle is the pointwise supremum of arbitrary functions in $W^{1,2,p}$ and the operator is only assumed to be measurable in the state and time variables. The results hold for a large class of non-smooth obstacles, including all convex obstacles. Applied to stopping problems, they imply that the decision maker never stops at a convex kink of the stopping payoff. The proof relies on new $W^{1,2,p}$-estimates for obstacle problems where the obstacle is the maximum of finitely many functions in $W^{1,2,p}$.</description>

      <title>Permutation symmetric solutions of the incompressible Euler equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study permutation symmetric solutions of the incompressible Euler equation. We show that the dynamics of these solutions can be reduced to an evolution equation on a single vorticity component $\omega_1$, and we characterize the relevant constraint space for this vorticity component under permutation symmetry. We also give single vorticity component versions of the energy equality, Beale-Kato-Majda criterion, and local wellposedness theory that are specific to the permutation symmetric case. This paper is significantly motivated by recent work of the author [11], which proved finite-time blowup for solutions of a Fourier-restricted Euler model equation, where the Helmholtz projection is replaced by a projection onto a more restrictive constraint space. The blowup solutions for this model equation are odd, permutation symmetric, and mirror symmetric about the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=0.$ Using the blowup solution introduced by Elgindi in [5], we are able to show that there are $C^{1,\alpha}$ solutions of the full Euler equation that are odd, permutation symmetric, and mirror symmetric about the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=0$, that blowup in finite-time.</description>

      <title>A new gap in the critical exponent for semi-linear structurally damped evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our aim in this paper is to discuss the critical exponent in semi-linear structurally damped wave and beam equations with additional dispersion term. The special model we have in mind is $$ u_{tt}(t,x)+(-\Delta)^{\sigma}u(t,x)+(-\Delta)^{2\delta}u(t,x)+2(-\Delta)^{\delta}u_{t}(t,x)=\left|u(t,x)\right| ^{p} $$ where the initial displacement $u(0,x)=u_{0}(x)$, the initial velocity $u_{t}(0,x)=u_{1}(x)$ and the parameters $ t\in [0,\infty)$, $x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\sigma\geq 1$, $\delta\in(0,\frac{\sigma}{2})$, $p&gt;1$. The solution to the linear equation at low frequency region involves an interplay of diffusion and oscillation phenomena represented by a real-complex Fourier multiplier of the form $$m(t,\xi)=\frac{e^{-|\xi|^{2\delta}t\pm i|\xi|^{\sigma}t}}{2i|\xi|^{\sigma}}, \ \ \xi\in \mathbb{R}^{n}, \ \ i=\sqrt{-1}.$$ The scaling argument shows that the diffusive part leads to faster decay rates compared to the oscillatory one. This interplay creates a new gap in the critical exponent between the blow up (in finite time) result when $1&lt;p&lt;1+\frac{4\delta}{n-2\delta}$ (sub-critical case) and the global (in time) existence result when $p&gt;1+\frac{\sigma+2\delta}{n-\sigma}$ (super-critical case). We leave an open to show if this gap will be closed at least in low or high space dimensions because, to the best of authors knowledge, the necessary Fourier multiplier that leads to the sub-critical case does not explicitly appear in $m(t,\xi)$.</description>

      <title>Fractional mean field equations on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the author considers the fractional mean field equation on a finite graph $G=(V,E)$, say
\begin{equation*}
(-\Delta)^s u=\rho\left(\dfrac{he^u}{\int_V he^ud\mu}-\dfrac{1}{|V|}\right),\quad\forall\,x\in V,
\end{equation*}
where $s\in(0,\,1)$, $\rho\in(-\infty,\,0)\cup(0,\,+\infty)$ are some fixed parameters, $h$ denotes a given real value function on $V$. Based on the sign of the prescribed function $h$, via the variational method, topological degree and two mean field type heat flows, the author obtains the existence of solutions for the above problem in three cases respectively. These results extend the relevant research of Lin-Yang (Calc. Var., 2021), Sun-Wang (Adv. Math., 2022) and Liu-Zhang (J. Math. Anal. Appl., 2023) in the case of $s=1$.</description>

      <title>Concentration and oscillation analysis of positive solutions to semilinear elliptic equations with exponential growth in a disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a series of concentration and oscillation estimates for elliptic equations with exponential nonlinearity $e^{u^p}$ in a disc. Especially, we show various new results on the supercritical case $p&gt;2$ which are left open in the previous works. We begin with the concentration analysis of blow-up solutions by extending the scaling and pointwise techniques developed in the previous studies. A striking result is that we detect an infinite sequence of bubbles in the supercritical case $p&gt;2$. The precise characterization of the limit profile, energy, and location of each bubble is given. Moreover, we arrive at a natural interpretation, the infinite sequence of bubbles causes the infinite oscillation of the solutions. Based on this idea and our concentration estimates, we next carry out the oscillation analysis. The results allow us to estimate intersection points and numbers between blow-up solutions and singular functions. Applying this, we finally demonstrate the infinite oscillations of the bifurcation diagrams of supercritical equations. In addition, we also discuss what happens on the sequences of bubbles in the limit cases $p\to 2^+$ and $p\to \infty$ respectively. As above, the present work discovers a direct path connecting the concentration and oscillation analyses. It leads to a consistent and straightforward understanding of concentration, oscillation, and bifurcation phenomena on blow-up solutions of supercritical problems.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions of Anisotropic (and crystalline) inverse mean curvature flow as limits of $p$-capacitary potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct weak solutions of the anisotropic inverse mean curvature flow (A-IMCF) under very mild assumptions both on the anisotropy (which is simply a norm in $\mathbb R^N$ with no ellip\-ticity nor smoothness requirements, in order to include the crystalline case) and on the initial data. By means of an approximation procedure introduced by Moser, our solutions are limits of anisotropic $p$-harmonic functions or $p$-capacitary functions (after a change of variable), and we get uniqueness both for the approximating solutions (i.e., uniqueness of $p$-capacitary functions) and the limiting ones. Our notion of weak solution still recovers variational and geometric definitions similar to those introduced by Huisken-Ilmanen, but requires to work within the broader setting of $BV$-functions. Despite of this, we still reach classical results like the continuity and exponential growth of perimeter, as well as outward minimizing properties of the sublevel sets. Moreover, by assuming the extra regularity given by an interior rolling ball condition (where a sliding Wulff shape plays the role of a ball), the solutions are shown to be continuous and satisfy Harnack inequalities. Finally, examples of explicit solutions are built.</description>

      <title>Global existence and boundedness of solutions to a fully parabolic chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global existence and boundedness of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the four dimensional fully parabolic chemotaxis system with indirect signal production are studied. We prove that solutions with initial mass below $(8\pi)^2$ exist globally in time. This value $(8\pi)^2$ is known as the four dimensional threshold value of the initial mass determining whether blow-up of solutions occurs or not. Furthermore, some condition on the initial mass guaranteeing that the solution remains uniformly bounded is also obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove gradient estimates of both elliptic and parabolic types, specifically, of Souplet-Zhang, Hamilton and Li-Yau types for positive smooth solutions to a class of nonlinear parabolic equations involving the Witten or drifting Laplacian on smooth metric measure spaces. These estimates are established under various curvature conditions and lower bounds on the generalised Bakry-\'Emery Ricci tensor and find utility in proving elliptic and parabolic Harnack-type inequalities as well as general elliptic and parabolic Liouville-type and other global constancy results. Several applications and consequences are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Soliton Amplification in the Korteweg-de Vries Equation by Multiplicative Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability and dynamics of solitons in the Korteweg de-Vries (KdV) equation with small multiplicative forcing. Forcing breaks the conservative structure of the KdV equation, leading to substantial changes in energy over long time. We show that, for small forcing, the inserted energy is almost fully absorbed by the soliton, resulting in a drastically changed amplitude and velocity. We decompose the solution to the forced equation into a modulated soliton and an infinite dimensional perturbation. Assuming slow exponential decay of the forcing, we show that the perturbation decays at the same exponential rate in a weighted Sobolev norm centered around the soliton.</description>

      <title>Maximum principles and moving planes method for the fractional $p(x,\cdot)$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the monotonicity of solutions for a nonlinear equations involving the fractional Laplacian with variable exponent. We first prove different maximum principles involving this operator. Then we employ the direct moving planes method to obtain monotonicity of solutions to a nonlinear equations in which the fractional laplacian with variable exponent is present. Note that, there are no results studying the monotonicity of solutions for local or nonlocal equations with variables exponent. Our results are new in this setting and includes a self-contained techniques.</description>

      <title>A class of globally analytic hypoelliptic operators on compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain global analytic hypoellipticity for a class of differential operators that can be expressed as a zero-order perturbation of a sum of squares of vector fields with real-analytic coefficients on compact Lie groups. The key conditions are: the vector fields must satisfy H\"ormander's finite type condition; there exists a closed subgroup whose action leaves the vector fields invariant; and the operator must be elliptic in directions transversal to the action of the subgroup. This paves the way for further studies on the regularity of sums of squares on principal fiber bundles.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability for active suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the nonlinear analysis of a kinetic model  introduced by Saintillan and Shelley  to describe suspensions  of active rodlike particles in viscous flows. We investigate the  stability of the constant state $\Psi(t,x,p) = \frac{1}{4\pi} $  corresponding to a distribution of particles that is homogeneous in  space (variable $x \in \mathbb{T}^3$) and uniform in orientation (variable  $p \in \mathbb{S}^2$). We prove its nonlinear stability under the optimal  condition of linearized spectral stability, without any addition of  spatial diffusion. The mathematical novelty and difficulty compared  to previous linear studies comes from the presence of a quasilinear  term in $x$ due to nonlinear convection.  A key feature of our work,  which we hope to be of independent interest, is an analysis of  enhanced dissipation and mixing properties of the advection  diffusion operator  $$\partial_t + (p + u(t,x)) \cdot \nabla_x - \nu \Delta_p $$  on $\mathbb{T}^3 \times \mathbb{S}^2$ for a given appropriately small vector  field $u$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider rotated $n$-Laplace systems on the unit ball $B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of the form
  \begin{align*}
  -\mathrm{div}\left( Q|\nabla u|^{n-2} \nabla u\right) = \mathrm{div}(G),
  \end{align*}
  where $u\in W^{1,n}(B_1;\mathbb{R}^N)$, $Q\in W^{1,n}(B_1;SO(N))$ and $G\in L^{\left( \frac{n}{n-1},q \right)}(B_1;\mathbb{R}^n\otimes \mathbb{R}^N)$ for some $0&lt;q&lt;\frac{n}{n-1}$. We prove that $\nabla u\in L^{(n,q(n-1))}_{loc}$ with estimates. As a corollary, we obtain that solutions to $\Delta_n u \in \mathcal{H}^1$, where $\mathcal{H}^1$ is the Hardy space, have a higher integrability, namely $\nabla u \in L^{(n,n-1)}_{loc}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a real number $q$ and a star body in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, the generalized dual curvature measure of a convex body was introduced by Lutwak-Yang-Zhang [43]. The corresponding generalized dual Minkowski problem is studied in this paper. By using variational methods, we solve the generalized dual Minkowski problem for $q&lt;0$, and the even generalized dual Minkowski problem for $0\leq q\leq1$. We also obtain a sufficient condition for the existence of solutions to the even generalized dual Minkowski problem for $1&lt;q&lt;n$.</description>

      <title>Rigorous derivation of an effective model for coupled Stokes advection, reaction and diffusion with freely evolving microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the homogenisation of a coupled Stokes flow and advection--reaction--diffusion problem in a perforated domain with an evolving microstructure of size $\varepsilon$. Reactions at the boundaries of the microscopic interfaces lead to the formation of a solid layer having a variable, a priori unknown thickness. This results in a growth or shrinkage of the solid phase and, thus, the domain evolution is not known a priori but induced by the advection--reaction--diffusion process. The achievements of this work are the existence and uniqueness of a weak microscopic solution and the rigorous derivation of an effective model for $\varepsilon \to 0$, based on $\varepsilon$-uniform a priori estimates. As a result of the limit passage, the processes on the macroscale are described by an advection--reaction--diffusion problem coupled to Darcy's equation with effective coefficients (porosity, diffusivity and permeability) depending on local cell problems. These local problems are formulated on cells, which depend on the macroscopic position and evolve in time. In particular, the evolution of these cells depends on the macroscopic concentration. Thus, the cell problems (respectively the effective coefficients) are coupled to the macroscopic unknowns and vice versa, leading to a strongly coupled micro--macro model. For pure reactive--diffusive transport coupled with microscopic domain evolution but without advective transport, homogenisation results have recently been presented. We extend these models by advective transport which is driven by the Stokes equation in the a priori unknown evolving pore domain.</description>

      <title>On regularity and rigidity of $2\times 2$ differential inclusions into non-elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differential inclusions $Du\in \Pi$ in an open set $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$, where $\Pi\subset \mathbb R^{2\times 2}$ is a compact connected $C^2$ curve without rank-one connections, but non-elliptic: tangent lines to $\Pi$ may have rank-one connections, so that classical regularity and rigidity results do not apply. For a wide class of such curves $\Pi$, we show that $Du$ is locally Lipschitz outside a discrete set, and is rigidly characterized around each singularity. Moreover, in the partially elliptic case where at least one tangent line to $\Pi$ has no rank-one connections, or under some topological restrictions on the tangent bundle of $\Pi$, there are no singularities. This goes well beyond previously known particular cases related to Burgers' equation and to the Aviles-Giga functional. The key is the identification and appropriate use of a general underlying structure: an infinite family of conservation laws, called entropy productions in reference to the theory of scalar conservation laws.</description>

      <title>New Bellman induction and a weak version of $\mathrm{BMO}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We enlarge the area of applicability of the Bellman function method to estimates in the spirit of the John--Nirenberg inequality abandoning certain convexity assumptions. As an application, we consider a characteristic of a function that is much smaller than the $\mathrm{BMO}$ norm, but whose finiteness leads to the exponential integrability of the function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review a recent new approach to the study of critical points of Laplacian eigenfunctions. Its core novelty is a non-standard variational principle for the eigenvalues of the Laplacians with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on bounded, simply connected planar domains. This principle can be used to provide simple proofs of some previously known results on the hot spots conjecture.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation of Schr\"odinger-type equations for $\bar\partial$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the unique continuation property for a Schr\"odinger-type equation $ \bar\partial u = Vu$ on a domain in $\mathbb C^n$, where the solution $u$ may be a scalar function, or a vector-valued function. While simple examples show that the unique continuation property fails in general if the potential $V\in L^{p}, p&lt;2n$, we first prove that, in the case when $u $ is a scalar function, the unique continuation property holds when $V\in L_{loc}^{2n}$ and is $\bar\partial$-closed. For vector-valued smooth solutions, we establish the unique continuation property either when $V\in L_{loc}^p $, $ p&gt;2n$ for $n\ge 3$, or when $V\in L_{loc}^{2n}$ for $n = 2$. Finally, we discuss the unique continuation property for some special cases where $V\notin L_{loc}^{2n}$, for instance, $V $ is a constant multiple of $ \frac{1}{|z|}$.</description>

      <title>Linear distortion and rescaling for quasiregular values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sobolev mappings exhibiting only pointwise quasiregularity-type bounds have arisen in various applications, leading to a recently developed theory of quasiregular values. In this article, we show that by using rescaling, one obtains a direct bridge between this theory and the classical theory of quasiregular maps. More precisely, we prove that a non-constant mapping $f \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$ with a $(K, \Sigma)$-quasiregular value at $f(x_0)$ can be rescaled at $x_0$ to a non-constant $K$-quasiregular mapping. Our proof of this fact involves establishing a quasiregular values -version of the linear distortion bound of quasiregular mappings. A quasiregular values variant of the small $K$ -theorem is obtained as an immediate corollary of our main result.</description>

      <title>Quasiconvex functions on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.11568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a definition of a quasiconvex function on an infinite directed regular tree that depends on what we understood by a segment on the tree. Our definition is based on thinking on segments as sub-trees with the root as the midpoint of the segment. A convex set in the tree is then a subset such that it contains every midpoint of every segment with terminal nodes in the set. Then a quasiconvex function is a real map on the tree such that every level set is a convex set. For this concept of quasiconvex functions on a tree, we show that given a continuous boundary datum there exists a unique quasiconvex envelope on the tree and we characterize the equation that this envelope satisfies. It turns out that this equation is a mean value property that involves a median among values of the function on successors of a given vertex. We also relate the quasiconvex envelope of a function defined inside the tree with the solution of an obstacle problem for this characteristic equation.</description>

Abstract: We use the Landau-de Gennes energy to describe a particle immersed into nematic liquid crystals with a constant applied magnetic field. We derive a limit energy in a regime where both line and point defects are present, showing quantitatively that the close-to-minimal energy is asymptotically concentrated on lines and surfaces nearby or on the particle. We also discuss regularity of minimizers and optimality conditions for the limit energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the fractional Keller-Segel system in the temporal and spatial variables. We consider fractional dissipation for the physical variables including a fractional dissipation mechanism for the chemotactic diffusion, as well as a time fractional variation assumed in the Caputo sense. We analyze the fractional heat semigroup obtaining time decay and integral estimates of the Mittag-Leffler operators in critical Besov spaces, and prove a bilinear estimate derived from the nonlinearity of the Keller-Segel system, without using auxiliary norms. We use these results in order to prove the existence of global solutions in critical homogeneous Besov spaces employing only the norm of the natural persistence space, including the existence of self-similar solutions, which constitutes a persistence result in this framework. In addition, we prove a uniqueness result without assuming any smallness condition of the initial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear scalar conservation laws are traditionally viewed as transport equations. We take instead the viewpoint of these PDEs as continuity equations with an implicitly defined velocity field. We show that a weak solution is the entropy solution if and only if the ODE corresponding to its velocity field is well-posed. We also show that the flow of the ODE is $1/2$-H\"older regular. Finally, we give several examples showing that our results are sharp, and we provide explicit computations in the case of a Riemann problem.</description>

Abstract: The analysis of the mathematical and mechanical properties of thermoelastic coupling tensors in anisotropic laminates is the topic of this paper. Some theoretical results concerning the compliance tensors are shown and their mechanical consequences analyzed. Moreover, the case of thermally stable laminates, important for practical applications, is also considered. The study is carried out in the framework of the polar method, a mathematical formalism particularly well suited for the analysis of planar anisotropic problems, introduced by Prof. G. Verchery in 1979.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of fractional $1$-Laplacian diffusion equations with variable orders, proposed as a model for multiplicative noise removal. The existence and uniqueness of the weak solution are proven. To overcome the difficulties in the approximation process,we place particular emphasis on studying the density propertiesof the variable-order fractional Sobolev spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits favorable performance across the entire image.</description>

      <title>Time-Fractional Porous Medium Type Equations. Sharp Time Decay and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of porous medium type of equations with Caputo time derivative. The prototype problem reads as $\Dc u=-\A u^m$ and is posed on a bounded Euclidean domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. The operator $\A$ falls within a wide class of either local or nonlocal operators, and the nonlinearity is allowed to be of degenerate or singular type, namely, $0&lt;m&lt;1$ and $m&gt;1$. This equation is the most general form of a variety of models used to describe anomalous diffusion processes with memory effects, and finds application in various fields, including visco-elastic materials, signal processing, biological systems and geophysical science.
  We show existence of unique solution and new $L^p-L^\infty$ smoothing effects. The comparison principle, which we provide in the most general setting, serves as a crucial tool in the proof and provides a novel monotonicity formula. Consequently, we establish that the regularizing effects from the diffusion are stronger than the memory effects introduced by the fractional time derivative. Moreover, the solution attains the boundary conditions pointwise.
  Finally, we prove that the solution does not vanish in finite time if $0&lt;m&lt;1$, unlike the case with the classical time derivative. Indeed, we provide a sharp rate of decay for any $L^p$-norm of the solution for any $m&gt;0$. Our findings indicate that memory effects weaken the spatial diffusion and mitigate the difference between slow and fast diffusion.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equations in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Cauchy problem for the dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equation where $0&lt;\alpha \leq 1$ \begin{eqnarray*} \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \partial_t u+|\partial_x|^{1+\alpha}\partial_x u+uu_x=0,\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x), \end{array} \right. \end{eqnarray*} is locally well-posed in the Fourier-Lebesgue space $\widehat{H}^{s}_{r}(\mathbb{R})$. This is proved via Picard iteration arguments using $X^{s,b}$-type space adapted to the Fourier-Lebesgue space, inspired by the work of Gr\"unrock and Vega. Note that, previously, Molinet, Saut and Tzvetkov \cite{MST2001} proved that the solution map is not $C^2$ in $H^s$ for any $s$ if $0\leq \alpha&lt;1$. However, in the Fourier-Lebesgue space, we have a stronger smoothing effect to handle the $high\times low$ interactions.</description>

      <title>Constructive proofs of existence and stability of solitary waves in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a method to prove constructively the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves (solitons) in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation. By employing Fourier series analysis and computer-aided techniques, we successfully approximate the Fourier multiplier operator in this equation, allowing the construction of an approximate inverse for the linearization around an approximate solution $u_0$. Then, using a Newton-Kantorovich approach, we provide a sufficient condition under which the existence of a unique solitary wave $\tilde{u}$ in a ball centered at $u_0$ is obtained. The verification of such a condition is established combining analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, we derive a methodology to control the spectrum of the linearization around $\tilde{u}$, enabling the study of spectral stability of the solution. As an illustration, we provide a (constructive) computer-assisted proof of existence of a stable soliton in both the case with capillary effects ($T&gt;0$) and without capillary effects ($T=0$). The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized and provides a new approach for addressing the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in nonlocal nonlinear equations. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

Abstract: We show that the mean curvature flow of generic closed surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ avoids asymptotically conical and non-spherical compact singularities. We also show that the mean curvature flow of generic closed low-entropy hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ is smooth until it disappears in a round point. The main technical ingredient is a long-time existence and uniqueness result for ancient mean curvature flows that lie on one side of asymptotically conical or compact shrinking solitons.</description>

Abstract: We construct so-called Darboux transformations and solutions of the dynamical Hamiltonian systems with several space variables $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=\sum_{k=1}^r H_k(t)\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \zeta_k}\,$ $( H_k(t)= H_k(t)^*)$. In particular, such systems are analogs of the port-Hamiltonian systems in the important and insufficiently studied case of several space variables. The corresponding energy relations are written down. The method is illustrated by several examples, where explicit solutions are given.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Ability of PINNs To Solve Burgers' PDE Near Finite-Time BlowUp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been achieving ever newer feats of solving complicated PDEs numerically while offering an attractive trade-off between accuracy and speed of inference. A particularly challenging aspect of PDEs is that there exist simple PDEs which can evolve into singular solutions in finite time starting from smooth initial conditions. In recent times some striking experiments have suggested that PINNs might be good at even detecting such finite-time blow-ups. In this work, we embark on a program to investigate this stability of PINNs from a rigorous theoretical viewpoint. Firstly, we derive generalization bounds for PINNs for Burgers' PDE, in arbitrary dimensions, under conditions that allow for a finite-time blow-up. Then we demonstrate via experiments that our bounds are significantly correlated to the $\ell_2$-distance of the neurally found surrogate from the true blow-up solution, when computed on sequences of PDEs that are getting increasingly close to a blow-up.</description>
