      <title>Group Survival Probability under Contagion in Microlending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we apply a probabilistic approach to analyze the impact of contagious default among investment group members. A general formula is given to compute the group survival probability with the presence of contagion effect. Special cases of this probability model are examined. In particular, we show that if the investment group is homogeneous, defined in the paper, then including more members into the group will eventually lead to default with probability 1, contrasting with the non-contagious scenario, where the default probability increases monotonically with respect to the group size. Also, we provide an upper bound of the optimal group size under the homogeneous setup; so, one can run a linear search with finite time to locate this optimizer.</description>

      <title>Mean-field control problems with multi-dimensional singular controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider extended mean-field control problems with multi-dimensional singular controls. A key challenge when analysing singular controls are jump costs. When controls are one-dimensional, jump costs are most naturally computed by linear interpolation. When the controls are multi-dimensional the situation is more complex, especially when the model parameters depend on an additional mean-field interaction term, in which case one needs to "jointly" and "consistently" interpolate jumps both on a distributional and a pathwise level. This is achieved by introducing the novel concept of two-layer parametrisations of stochastic processes. Two-layer parametrisations allow us to equivalently rewrite rewards in terms of continuous functions of parametrisations of the control process and to derive an explicit representation of rewards in terms of minimal jump costs. From this we derive a DPP for extended mean-field control problems with multi-dimensional singular controls. Under the additional assumption that the value function is continuous we characterise the value function as the minimal super-solution to a certain quasi-variational inequality in the Wasserstein space.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical CEV Option Pricing Model: an Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18154v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to obtain closed form solutions for the semiclassical (or WKB) approximation of the heat kernel propagator of the diffusion equation defined by the constant elasticity variance (CEV) option pricing model. One of the key points is that our calculations are based on the Van Vleck-Morette determinant instead of the Van Vleck determinant used by other authors. In fact, we compute this determinant in two different ways: by means of the solution of the classical Hamiltonian equations, and by solving the variational equations. Furthermore, the calculation reveals an exponential factor in the prefactor of the kernel not considered in previous works.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Gini indices: An axiomatic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Via an axiomatic approach, we characterize the family of n-th order Gini deviation, defined as the expected range over n independent draws from a distribution, to quantify joint dispersion across multiple observations. This family extends the classical Gini deviation, which relies solely on pairwise comparisons. The normalized version is called a high-order Gini coefficient. The generalized indices grow increasingly sensitive to tail inequality as n increases, offering a more nuanced view of distributional extremes. The higher-order Gini deviations admit a Choquet integral representation, inheriting the desirable properties of coherent deviation measures. Furthermore, we show that both the n-th order Gini deviation and the n-th order Gini coefficient are statistically n-observation elicitable, allowing for direct computation through empirical risk minimization. Data analysis using World Inequality Database data reveals that higher-order Gini coefficients capture disparities that the classical Gini coefficient may fail to reflect, particularly in cases of extreme income or wealth concentration.</description>

      <title>Optimal investment with insider information using Skorokhod &amp; Russo-Vallois integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the maximization of the logarithmic utility for an insider with different anticipating techniques. Our aim is to compare the utilization of Russo-Vallois forward and Skorokhod integrals in this context. Theoretical analysis and illustrative numerical examples showcase that the Skorokhod insider outperforms the forward insider. This remarkable observation stands in contrast to the scenario involving risk-neutral traders. Furthermore, an ordinary trader could surpass both insiders if a significant negative fluctuation in the driving stochastic process leads to a sufficiently negative final value. These findings underline the intricate interplay between anticipating stochastic calculus and nonlinear utilities, which may yield non-intuitive results from the financial viewpoint.</description>
