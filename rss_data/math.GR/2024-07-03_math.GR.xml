      <title>Flatmates and the bounded cohomology of algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all algebraic groups over non-Archimedean local fields, the bounded cohomology vanishes. This follows from the corresponding statement for automorphism groups of Bruhat--Tits buildings, which hinges on the solution to the flatmate conjecture raised in earlier work with Bucher. Vanishing and invariance theorems for arithmetic groups are derived.</description>

      <title>Strong primeness for equivalence relations arising from Zariski dense subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that orbit equivalence relations arising from essentially free ergodic probability measure preserving actions of Zariski dense discrete subgroups of simple algebraic groups are strongly prime. As a consequence, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of a prime factorization for orbit equivalence relations arising from direct products of higher rank lattices. This extends and strengthens Zimmer's primeness result for equivalence relations arising from actions of lattices in simple Lie groups. The proof of our main result relies on a combination of ergodic theory of algebraic group actions and Popa's intertwining theory for equivalence relations.</description>

      <title>Determination of the stably free cancellation property for orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field, let $A$ be a finite-dimensional semisimple $K$-algebra, and let $\Lambda$ be an $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-order in $A$. We give practical algorithms that determine whether or not $\Lambda$ has the stably free cancellation property (SFC). As an application, we determine all finite groups $G$ of order at most $383$ such that the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ has SFC.</description>

      <title>Dead ends and rationality of complete growth series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete growth series of a finitely generated group is given by $\sum_{n\ge 0} A_ns^n$, where $A_n$ is the sum of elements of length $n$ in the group semiring. We study the $\mathbb NG$-rationality and $\mathbb NG$-algebraicity of such series. We show that having dead ends of arbitrarily large depths is an obstruction to $\mathbb NG$-rationality. In the case of the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg group $H_3(\mathbb Z)$, we prove that the complete series is not $\mathbb NG$-algebraic for any generating set. Dead ends are also used to show that complete growth series of higher Heisenberg groups are not $\mathbb NG$-rational for specific generating sets. Using a more general version of this obstruction, we prove that complete growth series of some lamplighter groups are not $\mathbb NG$-rational either.</description>

      <title>Relatively hyperbolic groups with planar boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove a version of Martin and Skora's conjecture that convergence groups on the $2$-sphere are covered by Kleinian groups. Given a relatively hyperbolic group pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$ with planar boundary and no Sierpinski carpet or cut points in its boundary, and with $G$ one ended and virtually having no $2$-torsion, we show that $G$ is virtually Kleinian. We also give applications to various versions of the Cannon conjecture and to convergence groups acting on $S^2$.</description>

      <title>Profinite rigidity of affine Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the irreducible affine Coxeter groups are first-order rigid and deduce from this that they are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense. We then show that the first-order theory of any irreducible affine Coxeter group does not have a prime model. Finally, we prove that universal Coxeter groups of finite rank are homogeneous, and that the same applies to every hyperbolic (in the sense of Gromov) one-ended right-angled Coxeter group.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Autoencoder -- Learning Group Structured Representations from Observed Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can agents learn internal models that veridically represent interactions with the real world is a largely open question. As machine learning is moving towards representations containing not just observational but also interventional knowledge, we study this problem using tools from representation learning and group theory. We propose methods enabling an agent acting upon the world to learn internal representations of sensory information that are consistent with actions that modify it. We use an autoencoder equipped with a group representation acting on its latent space, trained using an equivariance-derived loss in order to enforce a suitable homomorphism property on the group representation. In contrast to existing work, our approach does not require prior knowledge of the group and does not restrict the set of actions the agent can perform. We motivate our method theoretically, and show empirically that it can learn a group representation of the actions, thereby capturing the structure of the set of transformations applied to the environment. We further show that this allows agents to predict the effect of sequences of future actions with improved accuracy.</description>
