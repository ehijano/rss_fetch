      <title>Bounds of Block Rewards in Honest PinFi Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PinFi is a class of novel protocols for decentralized pricing of dissipative assets, whose value naturally declines over time. Central to the protocol's functionality and its market efficiency is the role of liquidity providers (LPs). This study addresses critical stability and sustainability challenges within the protocol, namely: the propensity of LPs to prefer selling in external markets over participation in the protocol; a similar inclination towards selling within the PinFi system rather than contributing as LPs; and a scenario where LPs are disinclined to sell within the protocol. Employing a game-theoretic approach, we explore PinFi's mechanisms and its broader ramifications. Our findings reveal that, under a variety of common conditions and with an assumption of participant integrity, PinFi is capable of fostering a dynamic equilibrium among LPs, sellers, and buyers. This balance is maintained through a carefully calibrated range of block rewards for LPs, ensuring the protocol's long-term stability and utility.</description>

      <title>Agent-based Modelling of Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What happens when an infinite number of players play a quantum game? In this paper, we will answer this question by looking at the emergence of cooperation in the presence of noise in a one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma (QuPD). We will use the numerical Agent-based model (ABM) and compare it with the analytical Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM) technique. To measure cooperation, we consider five indicators, i.e., game magnetization, entanglement susceptibility, correlation, player's payoff average, and payoff capacity, respectively. In quantum social dilemmas, entanglement plays a non-trivial role in determining the players' behavior in the thermodynamic limit, and we consider the existence of bipartite entanglement between neighboring players. For the five indicators in question, we observe \textit{first}-order phase transitions at two entanglement values, and these phase transition points depend on the payoffs associated with the QuPD game. We numerically analyze and study the properties of both the \textit{Quantum} and the \textit{Defect} phases of the QuPD via the five indicators. The results of this paper demonstrate that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with the chosen five indicators, provide insightful information on cooperative behavior in the thermodynamic limit of the one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma.</description>

      <title>Karma: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system of non-tradable credits that flow between individuals like karma, hence proposed under that name, is a mechanism for repeated resource allocation that comes with attractive efficiency and fairness properties, in theory. In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as an easy (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.</description>

      <title>A Mean Field Game Model for Timely Computation in Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of task offloading in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems constituting $N$ devices assisted by an edge server (ES), where the devices can split task execution between a local processor and the ES. Since the local task execution and communication with the ES both consume power, each device must judiciously choose between the two. We model the problem as a large population non-cooperative game among the $N$ devices. Since computation of an equilibrium in this scenario is difficult due to the presence of a large number of devices, we employ the mean-field game framework to reduce the finite-agent game problem to a generic user's multi-objective optimization problem, with a coupled consistency condition. By leveraging the novel age of information (AoI) metric, we invoke techniques from stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) theory and study the tradeoffs between increasing information freshness and reducing power consumption. In numerical simulations, we validate that a higher load at the ES may lead devices to upload their task to the ES less often.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Optimization Framework for Correlated Equilibria in Normal-Form Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In competitive multi-player interactions, simultaneous optimality is a key requirement for establishing strategic equilibria. This property is explicit when the game-theoretic equilibrium is the simultaneously optimal solution of coupled optimization problems. However, no such optimization problems exist for the correlated equilibrium, a strategic equilibrium where the players can correlate their actions. We address the lack of a coupled optimization framework for the correlated equilibrium by introducing an {unnormalized game} -- an extension of normal-form games in which the player strategies are lifted to unnormalized measures over the joint actions. We show that the set of fully mixed generalized Nash equilibria of this unnormalized game is a subset of the correlated equilibrium of the normal-form game. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy regularization to the unnormalized game and prove that the entropy-regularized generalized Nash equilibrium is a sub-optimal correlated equilibrium of the normal form game where the degree of sub-optimality depends on the magnitude of regularization. We prove that the entropy-regularized unnormalized game has a closed-form solution, and empirically verify its computational efficacy at approximating the correlated equilibrium of normal-form games.</description>

      <title>Decongestion by Representation: Learning to Improve Economic Welfare in Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Congestion is a common failure mode of markets, where consumers compete inefficiently on the same subset of goods (e.g., chasing the same small set of properties on a vacation rental platform). The typical economic story is that prices decongest by balancing supply and demand. But in modern online marketplaces, prices are typically set in a decentralized way by sellers, and the information about items is inevitably partial. The power of a platform is limited to controlling representations -- the subset of information about items presented by default to users. This motivates the present study of decongestion by representation, where a platform seeks to learn representations that reduce congestion and thus improve social welfare. The technical challenge is twofold: relying only on revealed preferences from the choices of consumers, rather than true preferences; and the combinatorial problem associated with representations that determine the features to reveal in the default view. We tackle both challenges by proposing a differentiable proxy of welfare that can be trained end-to-end on consumer choice data. We develop sufficient conditions for when decongestion promotes welfare, and present the results of extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data that demonstrate the utility of our approach.</description>
