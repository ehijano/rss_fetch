      <title>Characterization of strongly convex K\"ahler-Berwald metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F: T^{1,0}M\rightarrow[0,+\infty)$ be a strongly convex complex Finsler metric on a complex manifold $M$ and $\pmb{J}$ the canonical complex structure on the complex manifold $T^{1,0}M$. We give a geometric characterization of strongly convex K\"ahler-Berwald metrics. In particular, we prove that $\pmb{J}$ is horizontally parallel with respect to the Cartan connection iff $F$ is a K\"ahler-Berwald metric. We also prove that the Cartan connection and the Chern-Finsler connection associated to $F$ coincide iff $\pmb{J}$ is both horizontal and vertical parallel with respect to the Cartan connection. Based on these results, we give a rigidity theorem of strongly convex K\"ahler-Berwald metrics with constant holomorphic sectional curvatures.</description>

      <title>Pluriclosed 3-folds with vanishing Bismut Ricci form: General theory in the quasi-regular case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compact complex $3$-dimensional non-K\"ahler Bismut Ricci flat pluriclosed Hermitian manifolds (BHE) via their dimensional reduction to a special K\"ahler geometry in complex dimension $2$, recently obtained by Barbaro, Streets and the first and third authors. We show that in the quasi-regular case, the reduced geometry satisfies a 6th order non-linear PDE which has infinite dimensional momentum map interpretation, similar to the much studied K\"ahler metrics of constant scalar curvature (cscK). We use this to associate to the reduced manifold or orbifold Mabuchi and Calabi functionals, as well as to obtain obstructions for the existence of solutions in terms of the authomorphism group, paralleling results by Futaki and Calabi-Lichnerowicz-Matsushima in the cscK case. This is used to characterize the Samelson locally homogeneous BHE geometries in complex dimension 3 as the only non-K\"ahler BHE $3$-folds with $2$-dimensional Bott-Chern $(1,1)$-cohomology group, for which the reduced space is a smooth K\"ahler surface. We also discuss explicit solutions of the PDE on orthotoric K\"ahler orbifold surfaces, extending examples found by Couzens-Gauntlett-Martelli-Sparks in the framework of supersymmetric ${\rm AdS}_3 \times Y_7$ type IIB supergravity. Our construction yields infinitely many non-K\"ahler BHE structures on $S^3\times S^3$ and $S^1\times S^2 \times S^3$, which are not locally isometric to a Samelson geometry. These appear to be the first such examples.</description>

      <title>The Initial Value Problem for the Generalised Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the initial value problem for the Einstein equations in Hitchin's generalised geometry for the case of closed divergence (which correspond to the equations of motion in the bosonic part of the NS-NS sector in type II ten-dimensional supergravity) and establish the existence of a maximal globally hyperbolic development (MGHD). The dynamical fields, defined on a manifold of dimension $n+1$, are the space-time metric, a scalar field known as the dilaton function, and a two-form known as the $B$-field. We develop a generalisation of the Lorenz gauge which, applied to the $B$-field (and combined with a suitable gauge condition breaking diffeomorphism invariance), renders the system a wave equation with principal symbol given by the (dynamical) metric. Given initial data, we construct a development satisfying the gauge conditions. We show that all other developments are (in the appropriate sense) related to this development by a diffeomorphism, establishing geometric uniqueness. The existence of the MGHD follows then by a famous result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch.
  In showing existence and geometric uniqueness of developments, we follow an approach developed in detail by Ringstr\"om for the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field. In a preliminary section, we present a formulation which is disentangled from the specific assumptions made on the matter, so that adaptation to other systems is straightforward.</description>

      <title>Ricci-harmonic flow of $\mathrm{G}_2$ and Spin(7)-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new general flow of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures which we call the Ricci-harmonic flow of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. The flow is the coupling of the Ricci flow of underlying metrics and the isometric flow of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, but we also provide explicit lower order in the torsion terms. The lower order terms and the flow are obtained by analyzing the second order term in the Taylor series expansion of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures in normal coordinates. As such, the Ricci-harmonic flow described in the paper can be interpreted as the "heat equation" for $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. The lower order terms allow us to prove that the stationary points of the Ricci-harmonic flow are exactly torsion-free $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures on compact manifolds. We study various analytic and geometric properties of the flow. We show that the flow has short-time existence and uniqueness on compact manifolds starting with an arbitrary $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure and prove global Shi-type estimates. We also prove a modified local Shi-type estimates for the flow which assume bounds on the initial derivatives of the Riemann curvature tensor and the torsion but give uniform bounds on these quantities for all times. We prove a compactness theorem for the solutions of the flow and use it to prove that the Ricci-harmonic flow exists as long as the velocity of the flow remains bounded. We also study Ricci-harmonic solitons where we prove that there are no compact expanding solitons and the only steady solitons are torsion-free. We derive an analog of Hamilton's identity for gradient Ricci-harmonic solitons and prove some integral identities for the solitons. Finally, we prove a version of the Taylor series expansion for Spin(7)-structures and use it to derive the Ricci-harmonic flow of Spin(7)-structures.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Definition of the Integral and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard definition of integration of differential forms is based on local coordinates and partitions of unity. This definition is mostly a formality and not used used in explicit computations or approximation schemes. We present a definition of the integral that uses triangulations instead. Our definition is a coordinate-free version of the standard definition of the Riemann integral on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and we argue that it is the natural definition in the contexts of Lie algebroids, stochastic integration and quantum field theory, where path integrals are defined using lattices. In particular, our definition naturally incorporates the different stochastic integrals, which involve integration over H\"{o}lder continuous paths. Furthermore, our definition is well-adapted to establishing integral identities from their combinatorial counterparts. Our construction is based on the observation that, in great generality, the things that are integrated are determined by cochains on the pair groupoid. Abstractly, our definition uses the van Est map to lift a differential form to the pair groupoid. Our construction suggests a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus which we prove: the singular cohomology and de Rham cohomology cap products of a cocycle with the fundamental class are equal.</description>

      <title>Background fields in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09885v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of a general local gauge theory can be encoded in the structure of a so-called presymplectic gauge PDE -- an almost-$Q$ bundle over the spacetime exterior algebra, equipped with a compatible presymplectic structure. In the case of a trivial bundle and an invertible presymplectic structure, this reduces to the well-known AKSZ sigma model construction. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDEs whose base spaces are again gauge PDEs describing background fields. As such, the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle over a given spacetime. Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. Less obvious examples involve parametrised systems, Fedosov equations, and the so-called homogeneous (presymplectic) gauge PDEs. The latter are the gauge-invariant generalisations of the familiar homogeneous PDEs and they provide a very concise description of gauge fields on homogeneous spaces such as higher spin gauge fields on Minkowski, (A)dS, and conformal spaces. Finally, we briefly discuss how the higher-form symmetries and their gauging fit into the framework using the simplest example of the Maxwell field.</description>

      <title>Nodal set comparison for Allen--Cahn solutions with conical asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a comparison principle for entire solutions of the Allen--Cahn equation whose nodal sets, possibly singular, are asymptotic to a regular minimizing hypercone. We show that inclusion of the positive phases enforces a global ordering of the solutions. As a consequence, the positive phase uniquely determines the solution, and strict phase inclusion implies that the corresponding nodal sets are disjoint. Our analysis relies on a maximum principle for the linearized operator on unbounded domains that are not necessarily smooth, and yields an Allen--Cahn analogue of the strong maximum principle for minimal hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>The dual twistor theory of self-dual black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Taub-NUT and Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instantons, along with the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric, form a set of Euclidean metrics which can naturally be called `self-dual black holes', as they arise from self-dual slices of the most general vacuum, asymptotically flat black hole metric. These self-dual black holes are of interest for many reasons, and can famously be described through the non-linear graviton construction of twistor theory. However, the implicit nature of this twistor description obscures some features of the underlying geometry, particularly for the most general self-dual black holes. In this paper, we give a new construction of all asymptotically flat self-dual black holes based on holomorphic quadrics in flat dual twistor space, rather than the usual twistor space associated with self-duality. Remarkably, the geometry of the self-dual black holes -- including their hyperkahler structure, as well as Kerr-Schild and Gibbons-Hawking forms -- is directly encoded in the corresponding quadric. As a consequence, we obtain a previously unknown single Kerr-Schild form of the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric.</description>

      <title>A New Gauge-Theoretic Construction of 4-Dimensional Hyperk\"ahler ALE Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-compact hyperk\"ahler spaces arise frequently in gauge theory. The 4-dimensional hyperk\"ahler ALE spaces are a special class of non-compact hyperk\"ahler spaces. They are in one-to-one correspondence with the finite subgroups of SU(2) and have interesting connections with representation theory and singularity theory, captured by the McKay Correspondence.
  The 4-dimensional hyperk\"ahler ALE spaces are first classified by Peter Kronheimer via a finite-dimensional hyperk\"ahler reduction. In this paper, we give a new gauge-theoretic construction of these spaces. More specifically, we realize each 4-dimensional hyperk\"ahler ALE space as a moduli space of solutions to a system of equations for a pair consisting of a connection and a section of a vector bundle over an orbifold Riemann surface, modulo a gauge group action. The construction given in this paper parallels Kronheimer's original construction and hence can also be thought of as a gauge-theoretic interpretation of Kronheimer's construction of these spaces.</description>

Abstract: We formulate and study the negative gradient flow of an energy functional of Spin(7)-structures on compact $8$-manifolds. The energy functional is the $L^2$-norm of the torsion of the Spin(7)-structure. Our main result is the short-time existence and uniqueness of solutions to the flow. We also explain how this negative gradient flow contains, as the highest order terms, all independent second order differential invariants of Spin(7)-structures which can be made into an admissible $4$-form. We also study solitons of the flow and prove a non-existence result for compact expanding solitons.</description>

      <title>Conformal-biharmonic hypersurfaces in spheres and product spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformal-bienergy functional $E_2^c$ is a modified version of the classical bienergy functional $E_2$ and it is conformally invariant in the case of a four-dimensional domain. The critical points of $E_2^c$ are called conformal-biharmonic and denoted $c$-biharmonic. In the first part of the paper we study the $c$-biharmonic hypersurfaces $M^m$ with constant principal curvatures in the product space $ {\mathbb L}^m(\varepsilon) \times \mathbb{R} $, where $ {\mathbb L}^m(\varepsilon) $ denotes a space form of constant sectional curvature $ \varepsilon $. Specifically, we demonstrate that $ M^m $ is either totally geodesic or a cylindrical hypersurface of the form $ M^{m-1} \times \mathbb{R} $, where $ M^{m-1} $ is an iso\-parametric $c$-biharmonic hypersurface in $ {\mathbb L}^m(\varepsilon) $. In the second part of this article we obtain a full description of isoparametric $c$-biharmonic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^{m+1}$ and a complete classification of $c$-biharmonic hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature in $\mathbb{S}^{m+1}$, $m=2,3$ and $m=4$ with an additional assumption. In this context, we shall also prove a global result for compact $c$-biharmonic immersions in $\mathbb{S}^5$. In the final part of the paper, as a preliminary effort to understand $c$-biharmonic hypersurfaces in $ {\mathbb L}^m(\varepsilon) \times \mathbb{R} $ with \textit{non-constant} mean curvature, we establish that a totally umbilical $c$-biharmonic hypersurface must necessarily be totally geodesic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study metric aspects of the universal moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's equations as the complex structure $J$ varies over the Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}$ of a closed surface $\Sigma$. Our approach is gauge theoretical and builds on the theory of K\"ahler fibrations and the moment map interpretation of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. Our first main result establishes that, over the moduli space of cscK metrics, the universal moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's equations carries a natural complex structure together with a family of pseudo-K\"ahler metrics forming a K\"ahler fibration with a K\"ahler Ehresmann connection.
  We then investigate a second universal moduli space, constructed from the space of flat $G$-connections over $\mathcal{T}$, which admits a nontrivial $J$-dependent K\"ahler fibration structure discovered by Hitchin. Using symplectic reduction, we build universal moduli spaces of solutions to the harmonicity equations depending on a coupling constant $\alpha$, obtaining natural complex and pseudo-K\"ahler structures and an explicit K\"ahler potential. The main novelty here is that this moduli space is defined by a system coupling the scalar curvature with a cubic term in the Higgs field. Finally, we propose a conjectural relationship between the two resulting families of moduli spaces in the weak-coupling limit $\alpha\to 0$, inspired by the twistor geometry of Hitchin's hyperk\"ahler moduli space.</description>

Abstract: For non-trivial solutions to the zero mode equation on a closed spin manifold \[D \varphi=iA\cdot \varphi,\] we first provide a simple proof for the sharp inequality \eq{ \norm{A}_{L^n}^2 \ge \frac {n}{4(n-1)} Y(M,[g]), } where $Y(M,[g])$ is the Yamabe constant of $(M,g)$, which was obtained by Frank-Loss and Reuss. Then we classify completely the equality case by proving that equality holds if and only if $\varphi$ is a Killing spinor, and if and only if $(M,g)$ is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold with $A$ (up to scaling) as its Reeb field and $\varphi$ a vacuum up to a conformal transformation. More generalizations have been also studied.</description>

      <title>K-moduli of quasimaps and on quasi-projectivity of moduli of K-stable Calabi-Yau fibrations over curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a projective K-moduli space of quasimaps with a certain log Fano condition, which is regarded as a rational map from $\mathbb{P}^1$ to a projective space. Moreover, we investigate relationships between the K-moduli of quasimaps and the K-moduli of Calabi-Yau fibrations over curves of negative Kodaira dimension constructed by the authors when general fibers are Abelian varieties or irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds. As an application, we obtain the entire quasi-projectivity of the seminormalization and the ampleness of the CM line bundle on the normalization of the K-moduli space of Calabi-Yau fibrations in this case.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion and stochastic areas on complex partial flag manifolds with blocks of equal size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Brownian motion on complex partial flag manifolds with blocks of equal size as a matrix-valued diffusion from a Brownian motion on the unitary group. This construction leads to an explicit expression for the characteristic function of the joint distribution of the stochastic areas on these manifolds. The limit law of these stochastic areas is shown to be a multivariate Cauchy distribution with independent and identically distributed entries. By relating the area functionals on flag manifolds to the winding functional on the complex Stiefel manifold, we establish new results about simultaneous Brownian windings on the complex Stiefel manifold. To establish these results, this work introduces a new family of diffusions, which generalise both the Jacobi processes on the simplex and the Hermitian Jacobi processes.</description>
