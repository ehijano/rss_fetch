      <title>2D Theoretically Twistable Material Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of twisted two-dimensional (2D) materials, where twisting layers create moir\'e superlattices, has opened new opportunities for investigating topological phases and strongly correlated physics. While systems such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been extensively studied, the broader potential of a seemingly infinite set of other twistable 2D materials remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we define "theoretically twistable materials" as single- or multi-layer structures that allow for the construction of simple continuum models of their moir\'e structures. This excludes, for example, materials with a "spaghetti" of bands or those with numerous crossing points at the Fermi level, for which theoretical moir\'e modeling is unfeasible. We present a high-throughput algorithm that systematically searches for theoretically twistable semimetals and insulators based on the Topological 2D Materials Database. By analyzing key electronic properties, we identify thousands of new candidate materials that could host rich topological and strongly correlated phenomena when twisted. We propose representative twistable materials for realizing different types of moir\'e systems, including materials with different Bravais lattices, valleys, and strength of spin-orbital coupling. We provide examples of crystal growth for several of these materials and showcase twisted bilayer band structures along with simplified twisted continuum models. Our results significantly broaden the scope of moir\'e heterostructures and provide a valuable resource for future experimental and theoretical studies on novel moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Evolution of Order in Materials Microstructures Using Multi-Modal Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of high-performance materials for microelectronics, energy storage, and extreme environments depends on our ability to describe and direct property-defining microstructural order. Our present understanding is typically derived from laborious manual analysis of imaging and spectroscopy data, which is difficult to scale, challenging to reproduce, and lacks the ability to reveal latent associations needed for mechanistic models. Here, we demonstrate a multi-modal machine learning (ML) approach to describe order from electron microscopy analysis of the complex oxide La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$FeO$_3$. We construct a hybrid pipeline based on fully and semi-supervised classification, allowing us to evaluate both the characteristics of each data modality and the value each modality adds to the ensemble. We observe distinct differences in the performance of uni- and multi-modal models, from which we draw general lessons in describing crystal order using computer vision.</description>

      <title>Enhanced heat dissipation and lowered power consumption in electronics using two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturization of electronic components has led to overheating, increasing power consumption and causing early circuit failures. Conventional heat dissipation methods are becoming inadequate due to limited surface area and higher short-circuit risks. This study presents a fast, low-cost, and scalable technique using 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) coatings to enhance heat dissipation in commercial electronics. Inexpensive hBN layers, applied by drop casting or spray coating, boost thermal conductivity at IC surfaces from below 0.3 W/m-K to 260 W/m-K, resulting in over double the heat flux and convective heat transfer. This significantly reduces operating temperatures and power consumption, as demonstrated by a 17.4% reduction in a coated audio amplifier circuit board. Density functional theory indicates enhanced interaction between 2D hBN and packaging materials as a key factor. This approach promises substantial energy and cost savings for large-scale electronics without altering existing manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of the Kinetics of Non-Equilibrium Phase Transitions in Silicon Induced by an Ultra-Short Laser Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern semiconductor applications demand precise laser processing at the nanometer scale, requiring a detailed understanding of phase transitions and structural modifications. Accurate control over laser-induced processes in semiconductors is essential for generating surface structures and modifying surface properties. In this study, we present a numerical investigation of non-equilibrium laser-induced phase transitions in silicon (Si) using a hybrid atomistic-continuum model. The model combines the strengths of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations for atomisticscale descriptions of non-equilibrium phase transitions with a continuum approach to account for laser-generated free carriers. This framework captures the generation and diffusion of electronhole pairs, thermal diffusion, and electron-phonon coupling during laser energy deposition. We apply the model to determine the melting depth as a function of fluence for a 100 fs laser pulse at 800 nm. The results show that the stand-alone continuum approach underestimates the melting threshold compared to the hybrid atomistic-continuum model, which incorporates the detailed kinetics of melting. Additionally, we explore the effect of crystal orientation on melting dynamics. Lastly, the MD model is used to identify the conditions leading to the amorphization of the Si surface. These findings provide valuable insights into experimental observations of Si surface structuring induced by ultrashort laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Opinion on sustainability-performance relationship: Na-ion batteries versus Li-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new era for energy storage devices, such as rechargeable batteries, has been opened in the last decades. However, commercially available energy storage devices are based mainly on critical elements such as Li, Co, Mn, P, Ni, and graphite opening sustainability concerns for the industry and society. Yet, these elements are crucial for both, battery cells as well as for electrode and electrolyte material properties. New research directions point toward the development of materials free of such critical elements, but unfortunately often at the price of lower performance. In the present work, we study the interlink between sustainability and properties at both, material and battery cell levels of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and Na-ion batteries (SIBs). Sustainability factors, such as supply and environmental risks, are assessed based on the critical element content in the cells and the individual risks associated with these materials. Although LIB cells exhibit superior energy density compared to their Na-ion counterparts, their sustainability is compromised by the consumption of Li and graphite. SIBs do not work with graphite-like LIBs due to the difficulty of intercalating Na within the structure of graphite. They work with other carbonaceous materials that can be produced in a sustainable way from biomass. Moreover, the composition of cathode materials significantly influences the sustainability of SIBs cells, with cells containing P and V presenting notable supply and environmental concerns. SIBs, with cathodes such as a layered typed Na-metal oxide which contains Ni and Mn as redox centers and anodes such as hard carbon, demonstrate exceptional sustainability scores. Their potential energy densities are projected to match that of a LiFePO4 (LFP)-based LIB, making them increasingly attractive for commercial applications.</description>

      <title>Energy-GNoME: A Living Database of Selected Materials for Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in materials science is driving significant advancements in the discovery of advanced materials for energy applications. The recent GNoME protocol identifies over 380,000 novel stable crystals. From this, we identify over 33,000 materials with potential as energy materials forming the Energy-GNoME database. Leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) tools, our protocol mitigates cross-domain data bias using feature spaces to identify potential candidates for thermoelectric materials, novel battery cathodes, and novel perovskites. Classifiers with both structural and compositional features identify domains of applicability, where we expect enhanced accuracy of the regressors. Such regressors are trained to predict key materials properties like, thermoelectric figure of merit (zT), band gap (Eg), and cathode voltage ($\Delta V_c$). This method significantly narrows the pool of potential candidates, serving as an efficient guide for experimental and computational chemistry investigations and accelerating the discovery of materials suited for electricity generation, energy storage and conversion.</description>

      <title>Anomalous-Hall Neel textures in altermagnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the altermagnets, a new kind of colinear antiferromagnet with zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin-splitting of bands, have sparked great interest. Despite simple magnetic structures, these altermagnets exhibit intriguing and intricate dependence of AHE on the N\'eel vector, in contrast to the conventional perpendicular configuration of Hall current with magnetization in ferromagnets. However, the relationship between the AHE and the N\'eel vector remains largely elusive. Here, we propose an "extrinsic parameter" method and further reveal diverse unconventional anomalous Hall textures in the N\'eel vector space, dubbed anomalous-Hall N\'eel textures (AHNTs), for altermagnets. Notably, we find that AHNTs resemble the spin textures in momentum space, and identify 10 types across four categories of AHNTs in altermagnets. Meanwhile, we examine our key discoveries in prototypical altermagnets. Our work can offer a methodology for detecting N\'eel vectors via anomalous Hall transport, and provide useful guidelines for designing electronic and optoelectronic devices based on altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous dynamic restoration of Ti-15Mo alloy during hot compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-beta titanium alloys have shown low Young's modulus and good strength, making them excellent implant candidates. However, their processing using thermomechanical routes in single phase beta region results in heterogeneous microstructures due to high content alloying elements and consequent slow diffusion-controlled processes such as dynamic recovery. This study investigates the deformation behaviour of a Ti-15Mo alloy through hot compression experiments using a Gleeble 3800 device in the single beta domain at strain rates from 0.01 s-1 to 10 s-1, reaching final strains of 0.50 and 0.85 followed by immediate water quench. The findings show that the material presents a low strain rate sensitivity. The flow curves show significant strain hardening before reaching a steady-state regime, particularly at high strain rates. The strain hardening exponent calculations support the effect of molybdenum on retarding softening mechanisms such as dynamic recovery. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements of deformed samples revealed that dynamic recovery is the primary restoration mechanism, with continuous and geometric dynamic recrystallisation evidence. Due to the slow restoration process, we observe the subgrain formation for different deformation parameters. Therefore, we introduced an EBSD-based method to quantify dynamic recovery and subgrain size. We concluded that dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallisation decrease as the strain rate increases with minimal variation at higher strain rates.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Polaritons in Non-Centrosymmetric Systems: Theory of Terahertz Pump-Optical Probe Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid lattice-light modes, known as phonon-polaritons, represent the backbone of advanced protocols based on THz pumping of infrared modes. Here we provide a theoretical framework able to capture the different roles played by phonon-polaritons in experimental protocols based either on Raman-like pump and probe schemes, typical of four-wave-mixing processes, or on THz pump-visible probe three-wave mixing protocols. By using a many-body description of the nonlinear optical kernel, along with a perturbative solution of nonlinear Maxwell's equations, we highlight the advantages of exploiting broadband THz pumps to enlarge the phase space of the phonon-polariton dispersion accessible in a single experiment. Besides providing a quantitative description of existing and future experiments, our results offer a general framework for the theoretical modeling of the hybridization between light and lattice degrees of freedom in time-resolved experiments.</description>

      <title>Dissociative photoionization of EUV lithography photoresist models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dissociative photoionization of \textit{tert}-butyl methyl methacrylate, a monomer unit found in many ESCAP resists, was investigated in a gas phase photoelectron photoion coincidence experiment employing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) synchrotron radiation at 13.5 nm. It was found that the interaction of EUV photons with the molecules leads almost exclusively to dissociation. However, the ionization can also directly deprotect the ester function, thus inducing the solubility switch wanted in a resist film. These results serve as a building block to reconstruct the full picture of the mechanism in widely used chemically amplified resist thin films, provide a knob to tailor more performant resist materials, and will aid interpreting advanced ultrafast time-resolved experiments.</description>

      <title>Erbium doped yttrium oxide thin films grown by chemical vapour deposition for quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The obtention of quantum-grade rare-earth doped oxide thin films that can be integrated with optical cavities and microwave resonators is of great interest for the development of scalable quantum devices. Among the different growth methods, Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) offers high flexibility and has demonstrated the ability to produce oxide films hosting rare-earth ions with narrow linewidths. However, growing epitaxial films directly on silicon is challenging by CVD due to a native amorphous oxide layer formation at the interface. In this manuscript, we investigate the CVD growth of erbium-doped yttrium oxide (Er:Y2O3) thin films on different substrates, including silicon, sapphire, quartz or yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Alternatively, growth was also attempted on an epitaxial Y2O3 template layer on Si (111) prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to circumvent the issue of the amorphous interlayer. We found that the substrate impacts the film morphology and the crystalline orientations, with different textures observed for the CVD film on the MBE-oxide/Si template (111) and epitaxial growth on YSZ (001). In terms of optical properties, Er3+ ions exhibit visible and IR emission features that are comparable for all samples, indicating a high-quality local crystalline environment regardless of the substrate. Our approach opens interesting prospects to integrate such films into scalable devices for optical quantum technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The B-Pt alloy system contains several Pt-rich phases exhibiting complex structures, many with partial site occupation. It also exhibits a deep (nearly 1000 degrees C) eutectic. We evaluate the ab-initio total energies of the crystalline solids to clarify the identity and character of the phases. Our work identifies inconsistencies in materials databases such as the Inorganic Crystallographic Structure Database and the ASM Phase Diagram Database, but our total energy calculations allow us to match up experimentally reported stable phases with specific structures. High temperature Gibbs free energy calculations in the liquid and solid states at the composition Pt$_2$B reveal that the depth of the eutectic arises from the low energy and high entropy of the liquid state.</description>

      <title>A facile route to synthesize cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the long-sought cg-N with N-N single bond has been synthesized for the first time by a thermal-driven-only chemical route at ambient conditions. The successful synthesis of cg-N was achieved by first creating a solution of azides, which was then pretreated under vacuum conditions. Following the pretreatment, the resultant concentrated azide was heated at temperatures ranging from 260{\deg}C to 330{\deg}C for a reaction time of 3 hours, ultimately leading to the formation of cg-N. The emergent intense Raman peak characterized of cg-N provides solid evidence that the double bonded nitrogen-nitrogen transforms into a single bond form, which agrees well with cg-N structure. To date, this is the only work achieving the quantity of cg-N synthesized at ambient conditions by a facile route that can be further developed for the scalable synthesis and applications of polymerized nitrogen-based materials as high energy density materials.</description>

      <title>Secondary Grain Boundary Dislocations Alter Segregation Energy Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) trigger structure-specific chemical segregation of solute atoms. According to the three-dimensional (3D) topology of grains, GBs - although defined as planar defects - cannot be free of curvature. This implies formation of topologically-necessary arrays of secondary GB dislocations. We report here that these pattern-forming secondary GB dislocations can have an additional and, in some cases, even a much stronger effect on GB segregation than defect-free GBs. Using nanoscale correlative tomography combining crystallography and chemical analysis, we quantified the relationship between secondary GB dislocations and their segregation energy spectra for a model Fe-W alloy. This discovery unlocks new design opportunities for advanced materials, leveraging the additional degrees of freedom provided by topologically-necessary secondary GB dislocations to modulate segregation.</description>

      <title>The electronic structure of Mn$_{1-x}$Pb$_x$Bi$_2$Te$_4$: experimental evidence of topological phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates methods for controlling the physical properties of the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) by substituting Mn with Pb in Mn$_{1-x}$Pb$_x$Bi$_2$Te$_4$ (MPBT) solid solutions. This substitution enables tunable magnetic and electronic properties. Using various angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) techniques, including spin-resolved and circular dichroism (CD) measurements, we analyzed the evolution of the electronic structure across different Pb concentrations, with a focus on topological phase transitions (TPT) near x = 50 %. Key indicators of TPT include the presence or absence of topological surface states (TSS) and bulk band gap closure. The results show a gradual decrease of the bulk band gap in the electronic structure of MPBT up to x = 40 %, where it nearly vanishes, followed by a constant gap value between 40 - 60 %, and its reopening above 80 %, which is accompanied by a transition of the electronic structure of MPBT to a PbBi$_2$Te$_4$-like electronic structure. TSS were observed at x less than 30 % and greater than 80 %, as confirmed by CD and spin-resolved ARPES data, but were absent near x = 55 %, suggesting a distinct topological phase - possibly semi-metallic or a trivial insulator with a narrow gap phase. These findings demonstrate the tunability of the electronic structure of MPBT, making it a promising candidate for topological and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale Semiconductor Grafting: Enabling High-Performance, Lattice-Mismatched Heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor heterojunctions are foundational to many advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, achieving high-quality, lattice-mismatched interfaces remains challenging, limiting both scalability and device performance. Semiconductor grafting offers a promising solution by directly forming electrically active, lattice-mismatched heterojunctions between dissimilar materials. However, its scalability and uniformity at the wafer level have yet to be demonstrated. This work demonstrates the achievement of highly uniform, reproducible results across silicon, sapphire, and gallium nitride (GaN) substrates using wafer-scale semiconductor grafting. To illustrate this scalability, we conducted an in-depth study of a grafted Si/GaN heterojunction, examining band alignment through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and confirming crystallinity and interfacial integrity with scanning transmission electron microscopy. The resulting p-n diodes exhibit significantly enhanced electrical performance and wafer-scale uniformity compared to conventional approaches. This work establishes wafer-scale semiconductor grafting as a versatile and scalable technology, bridging the gap between laboratory-scale research and industrial manufacturing for heterogeneous semiconductor integration, and paving the way for novel, high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Economical and versatile subunit design principles for self-assembled DNA origami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-assembly of nanoscale synthetic subunits is a promising bottom-up strategy for fabrication of functional materials. Here, we introduce a design principle for DNA origami nanoparticles of 50-nm size, exploiting modularity, to make a family of versatile subunits that can target an abundant variety of self-assembled structures. The subunits are based on a core module that remains constant among all the subunits. Variable bond modules and angle modules are added to the exterior of the core to control interaction specificity, strength and structural geometry. A series of subunits with designed bond/angle modules are demonstrated to self-assemble into a rich variety of structures with different Gaussian curvatures, exemplified by sheets, spherical shells, and tubes. The design features flexible joints implemented using single-stranded angle modules between adjacent subunits whose mechanical properties, such as bending elastic moduli, are inferred from cryo-EM. Our findings suggest that incorporating a judicious amount of flexibility in the bond provides error tolerances in design and fabrication while still guaranteeing target fidelity. Lastly, while increasing flexibility could introduce greater variability and potential errors in assembly, these effects can be counterbalanced by increasing the number of distinct bonds, thereby allowing for precise targeting of specific structural binding angles within a broad range of configurations.</description>

      <title>Deep learning robotics using self-supervised spatial differentiation drive autonomous contact-based semiconductor characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating autonomous contact-based robotic characterization into self-driving laboratories can enhance measurement quality, reliability, and throughput. While deep learning models support robust autonomy, current methods lack pixel-precision positioning and require extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a self-supervised convolutional neural network with a spatially differentiable loss function, incorporating shape priors to refine predictions of optimal robot contact poses for semiconductor characterization. This network improves valid pose generation by 20.0%, relative to existing models. We demonstrate our network's performance by driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robot to characterize photoconductivity at 3,025 predicted poses across a gradient of perovskite compositions, achieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals regions of inhomogeneity. With this self-supervised deep learning-driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.</description>

      <title>Density-wave like behavior in a new Kagome material Ce$_{2}$Ru$_{3}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials with inherent geometric frustration can produce many interesting physical properties, such as flat bands, quantum spin liquid, chiral magnetism, superconductivity and density-wave orders. Sometimes, the localized 4$f$ electrons from Ce atoms coupled with other conduction electrons would also give rise to the flat bands near the Fermi level, and results in the formation of heavy fermion. Thus, it is highly probable that kagome material incorporating Ce element will display nontrivial physical properties. In this study, we present a new Kagome material belonging to the trinary Laves phase, Ce$_{2}$Ru$_{3}$Si, in which kagome plane is formed by Ru atoms. Electrical transport and specific heat measurements reveal a density-wave like transition. A Curie-Weiss behavior is observed in low-temperature region. Meanwhile we also find a relatively large specific coefficient $\gamma_{n}(0)$. The calculated Wilson ratio $R_\mathrm{W}\propto{\chi(0)/\gamma_{n}}$ is approximately 3.1, indicating a moderate electron correlation effect. Chemical doping of Ir at the Ru site rapidly suppresses this density-wave like transition, while Mo doping leads to a gradual decrease in transition temperature. Theoretical calculation indicates both the Ce-4$f$ and Ru-4$d$ electronic bands cross the Fermi level, forming a Mexican-hat-shape Fermi surface close to the Fermi energy, potentially accounting for the observed density-wave like transition. Our findings provide an useful platform for investigating how hybridization between 4$f$ and 4$d$ electrons influences the electronic transport, and the relationship between the density-wave transition and kagome structure.</description>

      <title>Impact of triplon damping on thermal Hall conductivity in Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal Hall effect in the Shastry-Sutherland model, incorporating interactions between quasiparticle excitations. In this model, with strong nearest-neighbor interactions, the ground state is well described by the direct product of spin-singlet states, and the elementary excitations to spin-triplet states are known as triplons. In candidate materials for this model, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions are inevitably present, resulting in topologically non-trivial band structures for triplon excitations. In this study, we examine quasiparticle damping due to triplon-triplon interactions as a potential factor contributing to the suppression of the thermal Hall effect. We apply nonlinear flavor-wave theory to the Shastry-Sutherland model and treat triplons as bosonic excitations. We calculate the triplon damping rate using the imaginary Dyson equation approach and evaluate the thermal Hall conductivity. Our findings demonstrate that triplons with nonzero Berry curvature are scattered by thermally excited triplons. This scattering effect suppresses the thermal Hall conductivity, particularly at finite temperatures, highlighting the significant role of triplon damping in the thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Self-learning path integral hybrid Monte Carlo with mixed ab initio and machine learning potentials for modeling nuclear quantum effects in water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of machine learned potentials (MLPs) has greatly expanded the space available for studying Nuclear Quantum Effects computationally with ab initio path integral (PI) accuracy, with the MLPs' promise of an accuracy comparable to that of ab initio at a fraction of the cost. One of the challenges in development of MLPs is the need for a large and diverse training set calculated by ab initio methods. This data set should ideally cover the entire phase space, while not searching this space using ab initio methods, as this would be counterproductive and generally intractable with respect to computational time.In this paper, we present the self-learning PI hybrid Monte Carlo Method using a mixed ab initio and ML potential (SL-PIHMC-MIX), where the mixed potential allows for the study of larger systems and the extension of the original SL-HMC method [Nagai et al., Phys. Rev. B 102, 041124 (2020)] to PI methods and larger systems. While the MLPs generated by this method can be directly applied to run long-time ML-PIMD simulations, we demonstrate that using PIHMC-MIX with the trained MLPs allows for an exact reproduction of the structure obtained from ab initio PIMD. Specifically, we find that the PIHMC-MIX simulations require only 5,000 evaluations of the 32-bead structure, compared to the 100,000 evaluations needed for the ab initio PIMD result.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant Raman control of material phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Important advances have recently been made in the search for materials with complex multi-phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light-matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above-bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes has been experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion has been limited to perturbative levels. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to overcome this challenge by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid-infrared pulses, we induce ferroelectric reversal in lithium niobate and phase switching in tin selenide and characterize the large-amplitude mode displacements through femtosecond Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and x-ray diffraction. This approach, validated by first-principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast speeds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bending the edge of a thin elastic material promotes rigidity far from its clamped boundary. However, this curvature-induced rigidity can be overwhelmed by gravity or other external loading, resulting in elastic buckling and large deformations. We consider the role of body geometry on this competition using experiments, numerical simulations, and reduced-order models. Finite element simulations are performed using a model nonlinear hyperelastic material, and a theoretical framework is proposed that incorporates small lateral curvatures, large longitudinal rotations, and a varying cross-sectional width. A particular focus is on the comparison between rectangular and triangular sheets, and trapezoidal sheets in between. Sheet geometry affects downward tip deflection by changing the relative importance of the sheet's weight and the rigidity provided by curvature, often in subtle ways. In extreme cases, non-monotonic deflection is observed with increasing sheet length, and a region of hysteretic bistability emerges, becoming more pronounced with rectangular sheets and large imposed curvatures. These findings demonstrate the profound impact of geometry on the competition between curvature-induced rigidity and gravity-induced deformation in thin elastic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of superconducting niobium and tantalum into superconducting quantum devices has been increasingly explored over the past few years. Recent developments have shown that two-level-systems (TLS) in the surface oxides of these superconducting films are a leading source of decoherence in quantum circuits, and understanding the surface oxidation kinetics of these materials is key to enabling scalability of these technologies. We analyze the nature of atmospheric oxidation of both niobium and a-tantalum surfaces at time scales relevant to fabrication, from sub-minute to two-week atmospheric exposure, employing a combination of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to monitor the growth of the surface oxides. The oxidation kinetics are modeled according to the Cabrera-Mott model of surface oxidation, and the model growth parameters are reported for both films. Our results indicate that niobium surface oxidation follows a consistent regime of inverse logarithmic growth for the entire time scale of the study, whereas a-Ta surface oxidation shows a clear transition between two inverse logarithmic growth regimes at time t = 1 hour, associated with the re-coordination of the surface oxide as determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Our findings provide a more complete understanding of the differences in atmospheric surface oxidation between Nb and a-Ta, particularly at short time scales, paving the way for the development of more robust fabrication control for quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that ultrafast optical pump pulses provide effective control over charge orders in the kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ with $A=$ K, Rb, and Cs. Starting from the real charge density waves (rCDWs) at the $p$-type Van Hove singularity, we conduct a thorough analysis of the post-pump dynamics by time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. Our analysis uncovers distinct dynamical phenomena under linearly and circularly polarized pumps. Linearly polarized pumps induce directional preferences in the rCDWs, accompanied by an enhancement in the flat band. Unexpectedly, charge nematicity also emerges and receives maximal enhancement at a resonant pump frequency, which we understand with a Rabi-oscillation-like model. On the other hand, circularly polarized pumps suppress the rCDWs uniformly and triggers imaginary CDWs (iCDWs) with charge loop currents. Our results can be directly compared to the pump-probe experiments on the kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

Abstract: The electric field of light induces--in a non centrosymmetric insulator--a dc current, quadratic in the field magnitude, and called "shift current". When addressed from a many-electron viewpoint, the shift current has a simple explanation and a simple formulation as well, deeply rooted in quantum geometry. The basic formula is then specialized to the independent-electron case, first for a disordered system in a supercell formulation, and then for a crystalline system. In the latter case the known shift-current formula is retrieved in a very transparent way.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), a newly discovered magnetic state, ingeniously integrates the properties of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, representing a significant breakthrough in the field of magnetic materials. Despite experimental verification of some typical AM materials, such as MnTe and MnTe$_2$, the pursuit of AM materials that feature larger spin splitting and higher transition temperature is still essential. Here, our research focuses on CrSb, which possesses N{\'e}el temperature of up to 700K and giant spin splitting near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Utilizing high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we meticulously map the three-dimensional electronic structure of CrSb. Our photoemission spectroscopic results on both (0001) and (10$\overline{1}$0) cleavages of CrSb collaboratively reveal unprecedented details on AM-induced band splitting, and subsequently pin down its unique bulk $g$-wave symmetry through quantitative analysis of the angular and photon-energy dependence of spin splitting. Moreover, the observed spin splitting reaches the magnitude of 0.93~eV near $E_F$, the most substantial among all confirmed AM materials. This study not only validates the nature of CrSb as a prototype $g$-wave like AM material but also underscores its pivotal role in pioneering applications in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Effect of Strain on the Band Gap of Monolayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolayer molybdenum disulfide ($\mathrm{MoS_2}$) under strain has many interesting properties and possible applications in technology. A recent experimental study examined the effect of strain on the bandgap of monolayer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ on a mildly curved graphite surface, reporting that under biaxial strain with a Poisson's ratio of 0.44, the bandgap decreases at a rate of 400 meV/\% strain. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a free-standing $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ monolayer, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) PBE, the hybrid functional HSE06, and many-body perturbation theory with the GW approximation using PBE wavefunctions (G0W0@PBE). For the unstrained monolayer, we found a standard level of agreement for the bandgap between theory and experiment. For biaxial strain at the experimental Poisson's ratio, we found that the bandgap decreases at rates of 63 meV/\% strain (PBE), 73 meV/\% strain (HSE06), and 43 meV/\% strain (G0W0@PBE), which are significantly smaller than the experimental rate. We also found that PBE predicts a similarly smaller rate (90 meV/\% strain) for a different Poisson's ratio of 0.25. Spin-orbit correction (SOC) has little effect on the gap or its strain dependence. The strong disagreement between theory and experiment may reflect an unexpectedly strong effect of the substrate on the strain dependence of the gap. Additionally, we observed a transition from a direct to an indirect bandgap under strain, and (under an equal biaxial strain of 10\%) a semiconductor-to-metal transition, consistent with previous theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Efficient Cross-layer Thermal Transport with Atypical Glassy-like Phenomena in Crystalline CsCu$_4$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in crystalline compounds with intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is crucial in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the lattice thermal conductivity of crystalline CsCu$_4$Se$_3$ by coupling first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics with a unified theory of thermal transport. We consider the effects of both cubic and quartic anharmonicity on phonon scattering rates and energy shifts, as well as the diagonal and off-diagonal terms of heat flux operators. Our results reveal that the vibrational properties of CsCu$_4$Se$_3$ are characterized by strong anharmonicity and wave-like phonon tunneling. In particular, the strong anharmonic scattering induced by Cu- and Cs-dominated phonon modes plays a non-negligible role in suppressing particle-like propagation. Moreover, the coherence-driven conductivity dominates the total thermal conductivity along the $z$-axis, leading to an anomalous, wide-temperature-range (100-700 K) glassy-like thermal transport. Importantly, the significant coherence contribution, resulting from the coupling of distinct vibrational eigenstates, facilitates effective thermal transport across layers, sharply contrasting with traditional layered materials. As a result, the non-monotonic temperature dependence of coherences' thermal conductivity results from the combined effects of anharmonic scattering rates and anharmonic phonon renormalization. Our work not only reveals the significant contributions from the off-diagonal terms of heat flux operators in crystalline CsCu$_4$Se$_3$, but also explains the non-monotonic relationship between wave-like thermal conductivity and anharmonic scattering, providing insights into the microscopic mechanisms driving anomalous heat transport.</description>

      <title>Interplay of metallicity, ferroelectricity and layer charges in SmNiO$_3$/BaTiO$_3$ superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using density-functional theory, we demonstrate that the formal layer charges of the metallic samarium nickelate electrode influence the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of the barium titanate in SmNiO$_3$/BaTiO$_3$ capacitors. We find that, despite the metallic screening of SmNiO$_3$, the spontaneous polarization of BaTiO$_3$ always aligns with the layer polarization of the SmNiO$_3$ formal charges. We also find zero critical thickness for the ferroelectricity in BaTiO$_3$ in this orientation. The opposite polarization direction is highly disfavored for thin BaTiO$_3$ slabs but becomes less unstable with increasing slab thickness. We construct a simple electrostatic model that allows us both to study the behavior for thicker BaTiO$_3$ and SmNiO$_3$ slabs and to extract the influence of various material parameters on the behavior. We mimic a metal-insulator transition in the SmNiO$_3$ by varying the metallic screening length, which we find greatly influences the stability of the ferroelectric polarization. Our results show that the layer charges in the metal electrodes strongly influence the properties in ferroelectric capacitors and in fact can provide new ways to control the ferroelectric properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent pseudo-spin model for monolayer-bilayer phase transitions in silver-based honeycomb layered materials, we propose that the critical pseudo-magnetic fields in such systems correspond to both the infinite-channel Feshbach resonance widths of a (Fermi-Dirac/Bose-Einstein/etc.) condensate in 2 dimensions, and equivalently to the Lee-Yang zeros of the Ising model of two pseudo-spins with a partition function corresponding to a class of functions that must include the Riemann Xi function. Identifying the quantum-mechanical operator that yields the discontinuous/random/topological spectrum of the critical pseudo-magnetic fields in such systems offers a tenable realisation of the Hilbert-P\'{o}lya conjecture.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect from inter-superlattice scattering in a noncollinear antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superlattice formation dictates the physical properties of many materials, including the nature of the ground state in magnetic materials. Chemical composition is commonly considered to be the primary determinant of superlattice identity, especially in intercalation compounds. Here, we find that, contrary to this conventional wisdom, kinetic control of superlattice growth leads to the coexistence of disparate domains within a compositionally "perfect" single crystal. We demonstrate that Cr$_{1/4}$TaS$_2$ is a bulk noncollinear antiferromagnet in which scattering between bulk and minority superlattice domains engenders complex magnetotransport below the N\'{e}el temperature, including an anomalous Hall effect. We characterize the magnetic phases in different domains, image their nanoscale morphology, and propose a mechanism for nucleation and growth. These results provide a blueprint for the deliberate engineering of macroscopic transport responses via microscopic patterning of magnetic exchange interactions in superlattice domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04613v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ComDMFT is a parallel computational package designed to study the electronic structure of correlated quantum materials from first principles. Our approach is based on the combination of first-principles methods and dynamical mean field theories. In version 2.0, we implemented fully-diagrammatic GW+EDMFT from first-principles. In this approach, correlated electrons are treated within full GW+EDMFT and the rest are treated within full-GW, seamlessly. This implementation enables the electronic structure calculation of quantum materials with weak, intermediate, and strong electron correlation without prior knowledge of the degree of electron correlation.</description>

      <title>Atomic evolution of hydrogen intercalation wave dynamics in palladium nanocrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solute-intercalation-induced phase separation creates spatial heterogeneities in host materials, a phenomenon ubiquitous in batteries, hydrogen storage, and other energy devices. Despite many efforts, probing intercalation processes at the atomic scale has been a significant challenge. We study hydrogen (de)intercalation in palladium nanocrystals as a model system and achieve atomic-resolution imaging of hydrogen intercalation wave dynamics by utilizing liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that intercalation wave mechanisms, instead of shrinking-core mechanisms, prevail at ambient temperature for palladium nanocubes ranging from ~60 nm down to ~10 nm. We uncover the atomic evolution of hydrogen intercalation wave transitioning from non-planar and inclined boundaries to those closely aligned with {100} planes. Our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the observed intercalation wave dynamics correspond to sorption pathways minimizing the lattice mismatch strain at the phase boundary. Unveiling the atomic intercalation pathways holds profound implications for engineering intercalation-mediated devices and advancements in energy sciences.</description>

      <title>Quantum weight: A fundamental property of quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum weight as a ground state property of quantum many-body systems that is encoded in the static structure factor and characterizes density fluctuation at long wavelengths. The quantum weight contains a wealth of information about dielectric responses and optical properties of the system, and is closely related to its quantum geometry. For systems with short-range interactions or Coulomb systems in low dimensions, we show that the many-body quantum metric (which measures the change of the ground state under twisted boundary condition) can be determined directly from the quantum weight that is a part of an equal-time ground-state correlation function. On the other hand, for three-dimensional Coulomb systems, we use dielectric sum rules to derive upper and lower bounds on their quantum weight in terms of electron density, static dielectric constant, and plasmon energy. Our work highlights quantum weight as a fundamental material parameter, which can be experimentally determined by x-ray scattering or electron loss spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a mesoscale field theory unifying the modeling of growth, elasticity, and dislocations in quasicrystals. The theory is based on the amplitudes entering their density-wave representation. We introduce a free energy functional for complex amplitudes and assume non-conserved dissipative dynamics to describe their evolution. Elasticity, including phononic and phasonic deformations, along with defect nucleation and motion, emerges self-consistently by prescribing only the symmetry of quasicrystals. Predictions on the formation of semi-coherent interfaces and dislocation kinematics are given.</description>

      <title>Superconducting memory and trapped magnetic flux in ternary lanthanum polyhydrides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting memory is a promising technology for data storage because of its speed, high energy efficiency, non-volatility, and compatibility with quantum computing devices. However, the need for cryogenic temperatures makes superconducting memory an extremely expensive and specialized device. Ternary lanthanum polyhydrides, due to their high critical temperatures of 240-250 K, represent a convenient platform for studying effects associated with superconductivity in disordered granular systems. In this work, we investigate a trapped magnetic flux and memory effects in recently discovered lanthanum-neodymium (La,Nd)H$_{10}$ and lanthanum-scandium (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ superhydrides at a pressure of 175-196 GPa. We use a steady magnetic field of a few Tesla (T) and strong pulsed fields up to 68 T to create the trapped flux state in the compressed superhydrides. We find a clockwise hysteresis of magnetoresistance in cerium CeH$_{9-10}$ and lanthanum-cerium (La,Ce)H$_{10+x}$ polyhydrides, a characteristic feature of granular superconductors. A study of the current-voltage characteristics and voltage-temperature curves of the samples with frozen magnetic flux indicates a significant memory effect in La-Sc polyhydrides already at 225-230 K.</description>

Abstract: By tailoring geometrical properties of magnetic nanocap structures, new possibilities appear to control its magnetic properties, such as the dynamics of magnetic vortices.
