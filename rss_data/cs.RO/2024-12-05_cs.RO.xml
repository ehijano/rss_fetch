      <title>Quaternion-based Unscented Kalman Filter for 6-DoF Vision-based Inertial Navigation in GPS-denied Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the orientation, position, and linear velocity estimation problem of a rigid-body moving in three-dimensional (3D) space with six degrees-of-freedom (6 DoF). The highly nonlinear navigation kinematics are formulated to ensure global representation of the navigation problem. A computationally efficient Quaternion-based Navigation Unscented Kalman Filter (QNUKF) is proposed on $\mathbb{S}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}$ imitating the true nonlinear navigation kinematics and utilize onboard Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) units to achieve successful GPS-denied navigation. The proposed QNUKF is designed in discrete form to operate based on the data fusion of photographs garnered by a vision unit (stereo or monocular camera) and information collected by a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU). The photographs are processed to extract feature points in 3D space, while the 6-axis IMU supplies angular velocity and accelerometer measurements expressed with respect to the body-frame. Robustness and effectiveness of the proposed QNUKF have been confirmed through experiments on a real-world dataset collected by a drone navigating in 3D and consisting of stereo images and 6-axis IMU measurements. Also, the proposed approach is validated against standard state-of-the-art filtering techniques. IEEE Keywords: Localization, Navigation, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Sensor-fusion, Inertial Measurement Unit, Vision Unit.</description>

      <title>RoboFail: Analyzing Failures in Robot Learning Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being trained on increasingly large datasets, robot models often overfit to specific environments or datasets. Consequently, they excel within their training distribution but face challenges in generalizing to novel or unforeseen scenarios. This paper presents a method to proactively identify failure mode probabilities in robot manipulation policies, providing insights into where these models are likely to falter. To this end, since exhaustively searching over a large space of failures is infeasible, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework, RoboFail. It is designed to detect scenarios prone to failure and quantify their likelihood, thus offering a structured approach to anticipate failures. By identifying these high-risk states in advance, RoboFail enables researchers and engineers to better understand the robustness limits of robot policies, contributing to the development of safer and more adaptable robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Novel Magnetic Actuation Strategies for Precise Ferrofluid Marble Manipulation in Magnetic Digital Microfluidics: Position Control and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise manipulation of liquid marbles has significant potential in various applications such as lab-on-a-chip systems, drug delivery, and biotechnology and has been a challenge for researchers. Ferrofluid marble (FM) is a marble with a ferrofluid core that can easily be manipulated by a magnetic field. Although FMs have great potential for accurate positioning and manipulation, these marbles have not been precisely controlled in magnetic digital microfluidics, so far. In this study for the first time, a novel method of magnetic actuation is proposed using a pair of Helmholtz coils and permanent magnets. The governing equations for controlling the FM position are investigated, and it is shown that there are three different strategies for adjusting the applied magnetic force. Then, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. To this aim, different magnetic setups are proposed for manipulating FMs. These setups are compared in terms of energy consumption and tracking ability across various frequencies. The study showcases several applications of precise FM position control, including controllable reciprocal positioning, simultaneous position control of two FMs, the transport of non-magnetic liquid marbles using the FMs, and sample extraction method from the liquid core of the FM.</description>

      <title>Proximal Control of UAVs with Federated Learning for Human-Robot Collaborative Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) is a growing area of research. In HRI, complex command (action) classification is still an open problem that usually prevents the real applicability of such a technique. The literature presents some works that use neural networks to detect these actions. However, occlusion is still a major issue in HRI, especially when using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), since, during the robot's movement, the human operator is often out of the robot's field of view. Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones. The FL enabled our approach to be trained in a distributed fashion, i.e., access to data without the need for cloud or other repositories, which facilitates the multi-robot system's learning. Furthermore, our multi-robot approach results also prevented occlusion situations, with experiments with real robots achieving an accuracy greater than 96%.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Thrust Estimation and Control Approach for Multirotors Micro Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of thrust estimation and control for the rotors of small-sized multirotors Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Accurate control of the thrust generated by each rotor during flight is one of the main challenges for robust control of quadrotors. The most common approach is to approximate the mapping of rotor speed to thrust with a simple quadratic model. This model is known to fail under non-hovering flight conditions, introducing errors into the control pipeline. One of the approaches to modeling the aerodynamics around the propellers is the Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT). Here, we propose a novel BEMT-based closed-loop thrust estimator and control to eliminate the laborious calibration step of finding several aerodynamic coefficients. We aim to reuse known values as a baseline and fit the thrust estimate to values closest to the real ones with a simple test bench experiment, resulting in a single scaling value. A feedforward PID thrust control was implemented for each rotor, and the methods were validated by outdoor experiments with two multirotor UAV platforms: 250mm and 500mm. A statistical analysis of the results showed that the thrust estimation and control provided better robustness under aerodynamically varying flight conditions compared to the quadratic model.</description>

      <title>A Minimalistic 3D Self-Organized UAV Flocking Approach for Desert Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a minimalistic swarm flocking approach for multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our approach allows the swarm to achieve cohesively and aligned flocking (collective motion), in a random direction, without externally provided directional information exchange (alignment control). The method relies on minimalistic sensory requirements as it uses only the relative range and bearing of swarm agents in local proximity obtained through onboard sensors on the UAV. Thus, our method is able to stabilize and control the flock of a general shape above a steep terrain without any explicit communication between swarm members. To implement proximal control in a three-dimensional manner, the Lennard-Jones potential function is used to maintain cohesiveness and avoid collisions between robots. The performance of the proposed approach was tested in real-world conditions by experiments with a team of nine UAVs. Experiments also present the usage of our approach on UAVs that are independent of external positioning systems such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Relying only on a relative visual localization through the ultraviolet direction and ranging (UVDAR) system, previously proposed by our group, the experiments verify that our system can be applied in GNSS-denied environments. The degree achieved of alignment and cohesiveness was evaluated using the metrics of order and steady-state value.</description>

      <title>Adaptive LiDAR Odometry and Mapping for Autonomous Agricultural Mobile Robots in Unmanned Farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned and intelligent agricultural systems are crucial for enhancing agricultural efficiency and for helping mitigate the effect of labor shortage. However, unlike urban environments, agricultural fields impose distinct and unique challenges on autonomous robotic systems, such as the unstructured and dynamic nature of the environment, the rough and uneven terrain, and the resulting non-smooth robot motion. To address these challenges, this work introduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for autonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural environments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry algorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping module that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for selective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to prioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted points and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in odometry estimated from scan matching against the map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art methods on field datasets collected in real-world agricultural environments featuring various planting types, terrain types, and robot motion profiles. Results demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate odometry estimation and mapping results consistently and robustly across diverse agricultural settings, whereas other methods are sensitive to abrupt robot motion and accumulated drift in unstructured environments. Further, the computational efficiency of our method is competitive compared with other methods. The source code of the developed method and the associated field dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/AG-LOAM.</description>

      <title>SuperLoc: The Key to Robust LiDAR-Inertial Localization Lies in Predicting Alignment Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Map-based LiDAR localization, while widely used in autonomous systems, faces significant challenges in degraded environments due to lacking distinct geometric features. This paper introduces SuperLoc, a robust LiDAR localization package that addresses key limitations in existing methods. SuperLoc features a novel predictive alignment risk assessment technique, enabling early detection and mitigation of potential failures before optimization. This approach significantly improves performance in challenging scenarios such as corridors, tunnels, and caves. Unlike existing degeneracy mitigation algorithms that rely on post-optimization analysis and heuristic thresholds, SuperLoc evaluates the localizability of raw sensor measurements. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods across various degraded environments. Our approach achieves a 54% increase in accuracy and exhibits the highest robustness. To facilitate further research, we release our implementation along with datasets from eight challenging scenarios</description>

      <title>An indoor DSO-based ceiling-vision odometry system for indoor industrial environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots operating in indoor industrial environments require a localization system that is reliable and robust. While Visual Odometry (VO) can offer a reasonable estimation of the robot's state, traditional VO methods encounter challenges when confronted with dynamic objects in the scene. Alternatively, an upward-facing camera can be utilized to track the robot's movement relative to the ceiling, which represents a static and consistent space. We introduce in this paper Ceiling-DSO, a ceiling-vision system based on Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO). Unlike other ceiling-vision systems, Ceiling-DSO takes advantage of the versatile formulation of DSO, avoiding assumptions about observable shapes or landmarks on the ceiling. This approach ensures the method's applicability to various ceiling types. Since no publicly available dataset for ceiling-vision exists, we created a custom dataset in a real-world scenario and employed it to evaluate our approach. By adjusting DSO parameters, we identified the optimal fit for online pose estimation, resulting in acceptable error rates compared to ground truth. We provide in this paper a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Incorporating System-level Safety Requirements in Perception Models via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception components in autonomous systems are often developed and optimized independently of downstream decision-making and control components, relying on established performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Traditional loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss and negative log-likelihood, focus on reducing misclassification errors but fail to consider their impact on system-level safety, overlooking the varying severities of system-level failures caused by these errors. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training paradigm that augments the perception component with an understanding of system-level safety objectives. Central to our approach is the translation of system-level safety requirements, formally specified using the rulebook formalism, into safety scores. These scores are then incorporated into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning perception models with system-level safety objectives. Simulation results demonstrate that models trained with this approach outperform baseline perception models in terms of system-level safety.</description>

      <title>QuadricsReg: Large-Scale Point Cloud Registration using Quadric Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of large-scale point cloud registration, designing a compact symbolic representation is crucial for efficiently processing vast amounts of data, ensuring registration robustness against significant viewpoint variations and occlusions. This paper introduces a novel point cloud registration method, i.e., QuadricsReg, which leverages concise quadrics primitives to represent scenes and utilizes their geometric characteristics to establish correspondences for 6-DoF transformation estimation. As a symbolic feature, the quadric representation fully captures the primary geometric characteristics of scenes, which can efficiently handle the complexity of large-scale point clouds. The intrinsic characteristics of quadrics, such as types and scales, are employed to initialize correspondences. Then we build a multi-level compatibility graph set to find the correspondences using the maximum clique on the geometric consistency between quadrics. Finally, we estimate the 6-DoF transformation using the quadric correspondences, which is further optimized based on the quadric degeneracy-aware distance in a factor graph, ensuring high registration accuracy and robustness against degenerate structures. We test on 5 public datasets and the self-collected heterogeneous dataset across different LiDAR sensors and robot platforms. The exceptional registration success rates and minimal registration errors demonstrate the effectiveness of QuadricsReg in large-scale point cloud registration scenarios. Furthermore, the real-world registration testing on our self-collected heterogeneous dataset shows the robustness and generalization ability of QuadricsReg on different LiDAR sensors and robot platforms. The codes and demos will be released at \url{https://levenberg.github.io/QuadricsReg}.</description>

      <title>Learning Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation for Omni-Directional Task Space Pose Tracking with a Wheeled-Quadrupedal-Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the whole-body loco-manipulation problem using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on the problem of how to coordinate the floating base and the robotic arm of a wheeled-quadrupedal manipulator robot to achieve direct six-dimensional (6D) end-effector (EE) pose tracking in task space. Different from conventional whole-body loco-manipulation problems that track both floating-base and end-effector commands, the direct EE pose tracking problem requires inherent balance among redundant degrees of freedom in the whole-body motion. We leverage RL to solve this challenging problem. To address the associated difficulties, we develop a novel reward fusion module (RFM) that systematically integrates reward terms corresponding to different tasks in a nonlinear manner. In such a way, the inherent multi-stage and hierarchical feature of the loco-manipulation problem can be carefully accommodated. By combining the proposed RFM with the a teacher-student RL training paradigm, we present a complete RL scheme to achieve 6D EE pose tracking for the wheeled-quadruped manipulator robot. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the significance of the RFM. In particular, we enable smooth and precise tracking performance, achieving state-of-the-art tracking position error of less than 5 cm, and rotation error of less than 0.1 rad.

      <title>Real-time Dynamics of Soft Manipulators with Cross-section Inflation: Application to the Octopus Muscular Hydrostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the embodied intelligence of biological creatures like the octopus, the soft robotic arm utilizes its highly flexible structure to perform various tasks in the complex environment. While the classic Cosserat rod theory investigates the bending, twisting, shearing, and stretching of the soft arm, it fails to capture the in-plane deformation that occurs during certain tasks, particularly those involving active lateral traction. This paper introduces an extended Cosserat rod theory addressing these limitations by incorporating an extra strain variable reflecting the in-plane inflation ratio. To accurately describe the viscoelasticity effect of the soft body in dynamics, the proposed model enhances the constitutive law by integrating the Saint-Venant Kirchhoff hyperelastic and Kelvin-Voigt viscous models. The active and environmental loads are accounted for the equations of motion, which are numerically solved by adapting the Geometric Variable Strain (GVS) approach to balance the accuracy and computational efficiency. Our contributions include the derivation of the extended Cosserat rod theory in dynamic context, and the development of a reduced-order numerical method that enables rapid and precise solutions. We demonstrate applications of the model in stiffness tuning of a soft robotic arm and the study of complex octopus' arm motions.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Event-Inertial Odometry using a Unified Gaussian Process Regression Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have combined monocular event camera and inertial measurement unit to estimate the $SE(3)$ trajectory. However, the asynchronicity of event cameras brings a great challenge to conventional fusion algorithms. In this paper, we present an asynchronous event-inertial odometry under a unified Gaussian Process (GP) regression framework to naturally fuse asynchronous data associations and inertial measurements. A GP latent variable model is leveraged to build data-driven motion prior and acquire the analytical integration capacity. Then, asynchronous event-based feature associations and integral pseudo measurements are tightly coupled using the same GP framework. Subsequently, this fusion estimation problem is solved by underlying factor graph in a sliding-window manner. With consideration of sparsity, those historical states are marginalized orderly. A twin system is also designed for comparison, where the traditional inertial preintegration scheme is embedded in the GP-based framework to replace the GP latent variable model. Evaluations on public event-inertial datasets demonstrate the validity of both systems. Comparison experiments show competitive precision compared to the state-of-the-art synchronous scheme.</description>

      <title>AffordDP: Generalizable Diffusion Policy with Transferable Affordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have shown impressive performance in robotic manipulation tasks while struggling with out-of-domain distributions. Recent efforts attempted to enhance generalization by improving the visual feature encoding for diffusion policy. However, their generalization is typically limited to the same category with similar appearances. Our key insight is that leveraging affordances--manipulation priors that define "where" and "how" an agent interacts with an object--can substantially enhance generalization to entirely unseen object instances and categories. We introduce the Diffusion Policy with transferable Affordance (AffordDP), designed for generalizable manipulation across novel categories. AffordDP models affordances through 3D contact points and post-contact trajectories, capturing the essential static and dynamic information for complex tasks. The transferable affordance from in-domain data to unseen objects is achieved by estimating a 6D transformation matrix using foundational vision models and point cloud registration techniques. More importantly, we incorporate affordance guidance during diffusion sampling that can refine action sequence generation. This guidance directs the generated action to gradually move towards the desired manipulation for unseen objects while keeping the generated action within the manifold of action space. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that AffordDP consistently outperforms previous diffusion-based methods, successfully generalizing to unseen instances and categories where others fail.</description>

      <title>MCVO: A Generic Visual Odometry for Arbitrarily Arranged Multi-Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making multi-camera visual SLAM systems easier to set up and more robust to the environment is always one of the focuses of vision robots. Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow FoV and are fragile in textureless environments with degenerated accuracy and limited robustness. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy for texture degeneration with wide FoV. However, current multi-camera SLAM systems face massive data processing pressure and elaborately designed camera configurations, leading to estimation failures for arbitrarily arranged multi-camera systems. To address these problems, we propose a generic visual odometry for arbitrarily arranged multi-cameras, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature extraction and tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams. Then we use the rigid constraints between cameras to estimate the metric scale poses for robust SLAM system initialization. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the SLAM back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate the robustness of our method over arbitrarily placed cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose estimation accuracy with better generalization ability.

      <title>IRisPath: Enhancing Off-Road Navigation with Robust IR-RGB Fusion for Improved Day and Night Traversability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous off-road navigation is required for applications in agriculture, construction, search and rescue and defence. Traditional on-road autonomous methods struggle with dynamic terrains, leading to poor vehicle control on off-road. Recent deep-learning models have used perception sensors along with kinesthetic feedback for navigation on such terrains. However, this approach has out-of-domain uncertainty. Factors like change in weather and time of day impacts the performance of the model. We propose a multi modal fusion network FuseIsPath capable of using LWIR and RGB images to provide robustness against dynamic weather and light conditions. To aid further works in this domain, we also open-source a day-night dataset with LWIR and RGB images along with pseudo-labels for traversability. In order to co-register the two images we developed a novel method for targetless extrinsic calibration of LWIR, LiDAR and RGB cameras with translation accuracy of 1.7cm and rotation accuracy of 0.827degree.</description>

      <title>Resilient Timed Elastic Band Planner for Collision-Free Navigation in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous navigation, trajectory replanning, refinement, and control command generation are essential for effective motion planning. This paper presents a resilient approach to trajectory replanning addressing scenarios where the initial planner's solution becomes infeasible. The proposed method incorporates a hybrid A* algorithm to generate feasible trajectories when the primary planner fails and applies a soft constraints-based smoothing technique to refine these trajectories, ensuring continuity, obstacle avoidance, and kinematic feasibility. Obstacle constraints are modelled using a dynamic Voronoi map to improve navigation through narrow passages. This approach enhances the consistency of trajectory planning, speeds up convergence, and meets real-time computational requirements. In environments with around 30\% or higher obstacle density, the ratio of free space before and after placing new obstacles, the Resilient Timed Elastic Band (RTEB) planner achieves approximately 20\% reduction in traverse distance, traverse time, and control effort compared to the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) planner. These improvements demonstrate the RTEB planner's potential for application in field robotics, particularly in agricultural and industrial environments, where navigating unstructured terrain is crucial for ensuring efficiency and operational resilience.</description>

      <title>Soft Adaptive Feet for Legged Robots: An Open-Source Model for Locomotion Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, artificial feet based on soft robotics and under-actuation principles emerged to improve mobility on challenging terrains. This paper presents the application of the MuJoCo physics engine to realize a digital twin of an adaptive soft foot developed for use with legged robots. We release the MuJoCo soft foot digital twin as open source to allow users and researchers to explore new approaches to locomotion. The work includes the system modeling techniques along with the kinematic and dynamic attributes involved. Validation is conducted through a rigorous comparison with bench tests on a physical prototype, replicating these experiments in simulation. Results are evaluated based on sole deformation and contact forces during foot-obstacle interaction. The foot model is subsequently integrated into simulations of the humanoid robot COMAN+, replacing its original flat feet. Results show an improvement in the robot's ability to negotiate small obstacles without altering its control strategy. Ultimately, this study offers a comprehensive modeling approach for adaptive soft feet, supported by qualitative comparisons of bipedal locomotion with state of the art robotic feet.</description>

      <title>Variable-Speed Teaching-Playback as Real-World Data Augmentation for Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because imitation learning relies on human demonstrations in hard-to-simulate settings, the inclusion of force control in this method has resulted in a shortage of training data, even with a simple change in speed. Although the field of data augmentation has addressed the lack of data, conventional methods of data augmentation for robot manipulation are limited to simulation-based methods or downsampling for position control. This paper proposes a novel method of data augmentation that is applicable to force control and preserves the advantages of real-world datasets. We applied teaching-playback at variable speeds as real-world data augmentation to increase both the quantity and quality of environmental reactions at variable speeds. An experiment was conducted on bilateral control-based imitation learning using a method of imitation learning equipped with position-force control. We evaluated the effect of real-world data augmentation on two tasks, pick-and-place and wiping, at variable speeds, each from two human demonstrations at fixed speed. The results showed a maximum 55% increase in success rate from a simple change in speed of real-world reactions and improved accuracy along the duration/frequency command by gathering environmental reactions at variable speeds.</description>

      <title>Remote Manipulation of Multiple Objects with Airflow Field Using Model-Based Learning Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-contact manipulation is an emerging and highly promising methodology in robotics, offering a wide range of scientific and industrial applications. Among the proposed approaches, airflow stands out for its ability to project across considerable distances and its flexibility in actuating objects of varying materials, sizes, and shapes. However, predicting airflow fields at a distance, as well as the motion of objects within them, remains notoriously challenging due to their nonlinear and stochastic nature. Here, we propose a model-based learning approach using a jet-induced airflow field for remote multi-object manipulation on a surface. Our approach incorporates an analytical model of the field, learned object dynamics, and a model-based controller. The model predicts an air velocity field over an infinite surface for a specified jet orientation, while the object dynamics are learned through a robust system identification algorithm. Using the model-based controller, we can automatically and remotely, at meter-scale distances, control the motion of single and multiple objects for different tasks, such as path-following, aggregating, and sorting.</description>

      <title>NeRF and Gaussian Splatting SLAM in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating outdoor environments with visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems poses significant challenges due to dynamic scenes, lighting variations, and seasonal changes, requiring robust solutions. While traditional SLAM methods struggle with adaptability, deep learning-based approaches and emerging neural radiance fields as well as Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM methods, offer promising alternatives. However, these methods have primarily been evaluated in controlled indoor environments with stable conditions, leaving a gap in understanding their performance in unstructured and variable outdoor settings. This study addresses this gap by evaluating these methods in natural outdoor environments, focusing on camera tracking accuracy, robustness to environmental factors, and computational efficiency, highlighting distinct trade-offs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that neural SLAM methods achieve superior robustness, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light, but at a high computational cost. At the same time, traditional methods perform the best across seasons but are highly sensitive to variations in lighting conditions. The code of the benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/nerf-3dgs-benchmark.</description>

      <title>Rotograb: Combining Biomimetic Hands with Industrial Grippers using a Rotating Thumb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of robotic grippers and hands for automation aims to emulate human dexterity without sacrificing the efficiency of industrial grippers. This study introduces Rotograb, a tendon-actuated robotic hand featuring a novel rotating thumb. The aim is to combine the dexterity of human hands with the efficiency of industrial grippers. The rotating thumb enlarges the workspace and allows in-hand manipulation. A novel joint design minimizes movement interference and simplifies kinematics, using a cutout for tendon routing. We integrate teleoperation, using a depth camera for real-time tracking and autonomous manipulation powered by reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Rotograb's rotating thumb greatly improves both operational versatility and workspace. It can handle various grasping and manipulation tasks with objects from the YCB dataset, with particularly good results when rotating objects within its grasp. Rotograb represents a notable step towards bridging the capability gap between human hands and industrial grippers. The tendon-routing and thumb-rotating mechanisms allow for a new level of control and dexterity. Integrating teleoperation and autonomous learning underscores Rotograb's adaptability and sophistication, promising substantial advancements in both robotics research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-VLA: Scaling Robot Foundation Models via Unified Diffusion and Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present DiffusionVLA, a novel framework that seamlessly combines the autoregression model with the diffusion model for learning visuomotor policy. Central to our approach is a next-token prediction objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\% accuracy on 102 previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally, we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved generalization capabilities with increased model size.</description>

      <title>Conveying Emotions to Robots through Touch and Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human emotions can be conveyed through nuanced touch gestures. However, there is a lack of understanding of how consistently emotions can be conveyed to robots through touch. This study explores the consistency of touch-based emotional expression toward a robot by integrating tactile and auditory sensory reading of affective haptic expressions. We developed a piezoresistive pressure sensor and used a microphone to mimic touch and sound channels, respectively. In a study with 28 participants, each conveyed 10 emotions to a robot using spontaneous touch gestures. Our findings reveal a statistically significant consistency in emotion expression among participants. However, some emotions obtained low intraclass correlation values. Additionally, certain emotions with similar levels of arousal or valence did not exhibit significant differences in the way they were conveyed. We subsequently constructed a multi-modal integrating touch and audio features to decode the 10 emotions. A support vector machine (SVM) model demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving 40% for 10 classes, with "Attention" being the most accurately conveyed emotion at a balanced accuracy of 87.65%.</description>

      <title>MOVE: Multi-skill Omnidirectional Legged Locomotion with Limited View in 3D Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legged robots possess inherent advantages in traversing complex 3D terrains. However, previous work on low-cost quadruped robots with egocentric vision systems has been limited by a narrow front-facing view and exteroceptive noise, restricting omnidirectional mobility in such environments. While building a voxel map through a hierarchical structure can refine exteroception processing, it introduces significant computational overhead, noise, and delays. In this paper, we present MOVE, a one-stage end-to-end learning framework capable of multi-skill omnidirectional legged locomotion with limited view in 3D environments, just like what a real animal can do. When movement aligns with the robot's line of sight, exteroceptive perception enhances locomotion, enabling extreme climbing and leaping. When vision is obstructed or the direction of movement lies outside the robot's field of view, the robot relies on proprioception for tasks like crawling and climbing stairs. We integrate all these skills into a single neural network by introducing a pseudo-siamese network structure combining supervised and contrastive learning which helps the robot infer its surroundings beyond its field of view. Experiments in both simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate the robustness of our method, broadening the operational environments for robotics with egocentric vision.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm Based System for Path Planning with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Swarms in Cell-Grid Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path Planning methods for autonomously controlling swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining momentum due to their operational advantages. An increasing number of scenarios now require autonomous control of multiple UAVs, as autonomous operation can significantly reduce labor costs. Additionally, obtaining optimal flight paths can lower energy consumption, thereby extending battery life for other critical operations. Many of these scenarios, however, involve obstacles such as power lines and trees, which complicate Path Planning. This paper presents an evolutionary computation-based system employing genetic algorithms to address this problem in environments with obstacles. The proposed approach aims to ensure complete coverage of areas with fixed obstacles, such as in field exploration tasks, while minimizing flight time regardless of map size or the number of UAVs in the swarm. No specific goal points or prior information beyond the provided map is required. The experiments conducted in this study used five maps of varying sizes and obstacle densities, as well as a control map without obstacles, with different numbers of UAVs. The results demonstrate that this method can determine optimal paths for all UAVs during full map traversal, thus minimizing resource consumption. A comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art approach is presented to highlight the advantages and potential limitations of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>BIMCaP: BIM-based AI-supported LiDAR-Camera Pose Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces BIMCaP, a novel method to integrate mobile 3D sparse LiDAR data and camera measurements with pre-existing building information models (BIMs), enhancing fast and accurate indoor mapping with affordable sensors. BIMCaP refines sensor poses by leveraging a 3D BIM and employing a bundle adjustment technique to align real-world measurements with the model. Experiments using real-world open-access data show that BIMCaP achieves superior accuracy, reducing translational error by over 4 cm compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Multi-Momentum Observer Contact Estimation for Bipedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As bipedal robots become more and more popular in commercial and industrial settings, the ability to control them with a high degree of reliability is critical. To that end, this paper considers how to accurately estimate which feet are currently in contact with the ground so as to avoid improper control actions that could jeopardize the stability of the robot. Additionally, modern algorithms for estimating the position and orientation of a robot's base frame rely heavily on such contact mode estimates. Dedicated contact sensors on the feet can be used to estimate this contact mode, but these sensors are prone to noise, time delays, damage/yielding from repeated impacts with the ground, and are not available on every robot. To overcome these limitations, we propose a momentum observer based method for contact mode estimation that does not rely on such contact sensors. Often, momentum observers assume that the robot's base frame can be treated as an inertial frame. However, since many humanoids' legs represent a significant portion of the overall mass, the proposed method instead utilizes multiple simultaneous dynamic models. Each of these models assumes a different contact condition. A given contact assumption is then used to constrain the full dynamics in order to avoid assuming that either the body is an inertial frame or that a fully accurate estimate of body velocity is known. The (dis)agreement between each model's estimates and measurements is used to determine which contact mode is most likely using a Markov-style fusion method. The proposed method produces contact detection accuracy of up to 98.44% with a low noise simulation and 77.12% when utilizing data collect on the Sarcos Guardian XO robot (a hybrid humanoid/exoskeleton).</description>

      <title>Design and Control of an Ultra-Slender Push-Pull Multisection Continuum Manipulator for In-Situ Inspection of Aeroengine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the shape of industrial endoscopes is passively altered according to the contact around it, manual inspection approaches of aeroengines through the inspection ports have unreachable areas, and it's difficult to traverse multistage blades and inspect them simultaneously, which requires engine disassembly or the cooperation of multiple operators, resulting in efficiency decline and increased costs. To this end, this paper proposes a novel continuum manipulator with push-pull multisection structure which provides a potential solution for the disadvantages mentioned above due to its higher flexibility, passability, and controllability in confined spaces. The ultra-slender design combined with a tendon-driven mechanism makes the manipulator acquire enough workspace and more flexible postures while maintaining a light weight. Considering the coupling between the tendons in multisection, a innovative kinematics decoupling control method is implemented, which can realize real-time control in the case of limited computational resources. A prototype is built to validate the capabilities of mechatronic design and the performance of the control algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our continuum manipulator in the in-situ inspection of aeroengines' multistage blades, which has the potential to be a replacement solution for industrial endoscopes.</description>

      <title>MVCTrack: Boosting 3D Point Cloud Tracking via Multimodal-Guided Virtual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D single object tracking is essential in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods often struggle with sparse and incomplete point cloud scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal-guided Virtual Cues Projection (MVCP) scheme that generates virtual cues to enrich sparse point clouds. Additionally, we introduce an enhanced tracker MVCTrack based on the generated virtual cues. Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to create dense 3D virtual cues that significantly improve the sparsity of point clouds. These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D trackers, yielding substantial performance gains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the NuScenes dataset.</description>

      <title>Hijacking Vision-and-Language Navigation Agents with Adversarial Environmental Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assistive embodied agents that can be instructed in natural language to perform tasks in open-world environments have the potential to significantly impact labor tasks like manufacturing or in-home care -- benefiting the lives of those who come to depend on them. In this work, we consider how this benefit might be hijacked by local modifications in the appearance of the agent's operating environment. Specifically, we take the popular Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task as a representative setting and develop a whitebox adversarial attack that optimizes a 3D attack object's appearance to induce desired behaviors in pretrained VLN agents that observe it in the environment. We demonstrate that the proposed attack can cause VLN agents to ignore their instructions and execute alternative actions after encountering the attack object -- even for instructions and agent paths not considered when optimizing the attack. For these novel settings, we find our attacks can induce early-termination behaviors or divert an agent along an attacker-defined multi-step trajectory. Under both conditions, environmental attacks significantly reduce agent capabilities to successfully follow user instructions.</description>

      <title>Point-GN: A Non-Parametric Network Using Gaussian Positional Encoding for Point Cloud Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Point-GN, a novel non-parametric network for efficient and accurate 3D point cloud classification. Unlike conventional deep learning models that rely on a large number of trainable parameters, Point-GN leverages non-learnable components-specifically, Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Gaussian Positional Encoding (GPE)-to extract both local and global geometric features. This design eliminates the need for additional training while maintaining high performance, making Point-GN particularly suited for real-time, resource-constrained applications. We evaluate Point-GN on two benchmark datasets, ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving classification accuracies of 85.29% and 85.89%, respectively, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Point-GN outperforms existing non-parametric methods and matches the performance of fully trained models, all with zero learnable parameters. Our results demonstrate that Point-GN is a promising solution for 3D point cloud classification in practical, real-time environments.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Mobile Target Tracking Using Consensus-Based Estimation with Nearly-Constant-Velocity Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile target tracking is crucial in various applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. This study presents a decentralized tracking framework utilizing a Consensus-Based Estimation Filter (CBEF) integrated with the Nearly-Constant-Velocity (NCV) model to predict a moving target's state. The framework facilitates agents in a network to collaboratively estimate the target's position by sharing local observations and achieving consensus despite communication constraints and measurement noise. A saturation-based filtering technique is employed to enhance robustness by mitigating the impact of noisy sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces the Mean Squared Estimation Error (MSEE) over time, indicating improved estimation accuracy and reliability. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the CBEF in decentralized environments, highlighting its scalability and resilience in the presence of uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Model Predictive Control for Differential-Algebraic Systems towards a Higher Path Accuracy for Physically Coupled Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical coupling between robots has the potential to improve the capabilities of multi-robot systems in challenging manufacturing processes. However, the path tracking accuracy of physically coupled robots is not studied adequately, especially considering the uncertain kinematic parameters, the mechanical elasticity, and the built-in controllers of off-the-shelf robots. This paper addresses these issues with a novel differential-algebraic system model which is verified against measurement data from real execution. The uncertain kinematic parameters are estimated online to adapt the model. Consequently, an adaptive model predictive controller is designed as a coordinator between the robots. The controller achieves a path tracking error reduction of 88.6% compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark in the simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental skill of agents with visual-motor capabilities. We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation systems.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous robots must utilize rich sensory data to make safe control decisions. To process this data, compute-constrained robots often require assistance from remote computation, or the cloud, that runs compute-intensive deep neural network perception or control models. However, this assistance comes at the cost of a time delay due to network latency, resulting in past observations being used in the cloud to compute the control commands for the present robot state. Such communication delays could potentially lead to the violation of essential safety properties, such as collision avoidance. This paper develops methods to ensure the safety of robots operated over communication networks with stochastic latency. To do so, we use tools from formal verification to construct a shield, i.e., a run-time monitor, that provides a list of safe actions for any delayed sensory observation, given the expected and maximum network latency. Our shield is minimally intrusive and enables networked robots to satisfy key safety constraints, expressed as temporal logic specifications, with desired probability. We demonstrate our approach on a real F1/10th autonomous vehicle that navigates in indoor environments and transmits rich LiDAR sensory data over congested WiFi links.</description>

      <title>Robust Lifelong Indoor LiDAR Localization using the Area Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lifelong indoor localization in a given map is the basis for navigation of autonomous mobile robots. In this letter, we address the problem of robust localization in cluttered indoor environments like office spaces and corridors using 3D LiDAR point clouds in a given Area Graph, which is a hierarchical, topometric semantic map representation that uses polygons to demark areas such as rooms, corridors or buildings. This representation is very compact, can represent different floors of buildings through its hierarchy and provides semantic information that helps with localization, like poses of doors and glass. In contrast to this, commonly used map representations, such as occupancy grid maps or point clouds, lack these features and require frequent updates in response to environmental changes (e.g. moved furniture), unlike our approach, which matches against lifelong architectural features such as walls and doors. For that we apply filtering to remove clutter from the 3D input point cloud and then employ further scoring and weight functions for localization. Given a broad initial guess from WiFi localization, our experiments show that our global localization and the weighted point to line ICP pose tracking perform very well, even when compared to localization and SLAM algorithms that use the current, feature-rich cluttered map for localization.</description>

      <title>Multimodal and Force-Matched Imitation Learning with a See-Through Visuotactile Sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01248v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contact-rich tasks continue to present many challenges for robotic manipulation. In this work, we leverage a multimodal visuotactile sensor within the framework of imitation learning (IL) to perform contact-rich tasks that involve relative motion (e.g., slipping and sliding) between the end-effector and the manipulated object. We introduce two algorithmic contributions, tactile force matching and learned mode switching, as complimentary methods for improving IL. Tactile force matching enhances kinesthetic teaching by reading approximate forces during the demonstration and generating an adapted robot trajectory that recreates the recorded forces. Learned mode switching uses IL to couple visual and tactile sensor modes with the learned motion policy, simplifying the transition from reaching to contacting. We perform robotic manipulation experiments on four door-opening tasks with a variety of observation and algorithm configurations to study the utility of multimodal visuotactile sensing and our proposed improvements. Our results show that the inclusion of force matching raises average policy success rates by 62.5%, visuotactile mode switching by 30.3%, and visuotactile data as a policy input by 42.5%, emphasizing the value of see-through tactile sensing for IL, both for data collection to allow force matching, and for policy execution to enable accurate task feedback.

      <description>arXiv:2402.17363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic graphs are extensively employed for detecting anomalous behavior in nodes within the Internet of Things (IoT). Graph generative models are often used to address the issue of imbalanced node categories in dynamic graphs. Nevertheless, the constraints it faces include the monotonicity of adjacency relationships, the difficulty in constructing multi-dimensional features for nodes, and the lack of a method for end-to-end generation of multiple categories of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel graph generation model, called CGGM, specifically for generating samples belonging to the minority class. The framework consists two core module: a conditional graph generation module and a graph-based anomaly detection module. The generative module adapts to the sparsity of the matrix by downsampling a noise adjacency matrix, and incorporates a multi-dimensional feature encoder based on multi-head self-attention to capture latent dependencies among features. Additionally, a latent space constraint is combined with the distribution distance to approximate the latent distribution of real data. The graph-based anomaly detection module utilizes the generated balanced dataset to predict the node behaviors. Extensive experiments have shown that CGGM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and divergence. The results also demonstrate CGGM can generated diverse data categories, that enhancing the performance of multi-category classification task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced machine learning algorithms require platforms that are extremely robust and equipped with rich sensory feedback to handle extensive trial-and-error learning without relying on strong inductive biases. Traditional robotic designs, while well-suited for their specific use cases, are often fragile when used with these algorithms. To address this gap -- and inspired by the vision of enabling curiosity-driven baby robots -- we present a novel robotic limb designed from scratch. Our design has a hybrid soft-hard structure, high redundancy with rich non-contact sensors (exclusively cameras), and easily replaceable failure points. Proof-of-concept experiments using two contemporary reinforcement learning algorithms on a physical prototype demonstrate that our design is able to succeed in a simple target-finding task even under simulated sensor failures, all with minimal human oversight during extended learning periods. We believe this design represents a concrete step toward more tailored robotic designs for achieving general-purpose, generally intelligent robots.</description>

      <title>Learning feasible transitions for efficient contact planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient contact planner for quadrupedal robots to navigate in extremely constrained environments such as stepping stones. The main difficulty in this setting stems from the mixed nature of the problem, namely discrete search over the steppable patches and continuous trajectory optimization. To speed up the discrete search, we study the properties of the transitions from one contact mode to another. In particular, we propose to learn a dynamic feasibility classifier and a target adjustment network. The former predicts if a contact transition between two contact modes is dynamically feasible. The latter is trained to compensate for misalignment in reaching a desired set of contact locations, due to imperfections of the low-level control. We integrate these learned networks in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) contact planner. Our simulation results demonstrate that training these networks with offline data significantly speeds up the online search process and improves its accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We present a multi-modal trajectory generation and selection algorithm for real-world mapless outdoor navigation in human-centered environments. Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 22.07% in satisfying traversability constraints and 30.53% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nl2Hltl2Plan: Scaling Up Natural Language Understanding for Multi-Robots Through Hierarchical Temporal Logic Task Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08188v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enable non-experts to specify long-horizon, multi-robot collaborative tasks, language models are increasingly used to translate natural language commands into formal specifications. However, because translation can occur in multiple ways, such translations may lack accuracy or lead to inefficient multi-robot planning. Our key insight is that concise hierarchical specifications can simplify planning while remaining straightforward to derive from human instructions. We propose Nl2Hltl2Plan, a framework that translates natural language commands into hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and solves the corresponding planning problem. The translation involves two steps leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). First, an LLM transforms instructions into a Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing logical and temporal relations. Next, a fine-tuned LLM converts sub-tasks into flat LTL formulas, which are aggregated into hierarchical specifications, with the lowest level corresponding to ordered robot actions. These specifications are then used with off-the-shelf planners. Our Nl2Hltl2Plan demonstrates the potential of LLMs in hierarchical reasoning for multi-robot task planning. Evaluations in simulation and real-world experiments with human participants show that Nl2Hltl2Plan outperforms existing methods, handling more complex instructions while achieving higher success rates and lower costs in task allocation and planning.

      <title>Affordance-based Robot Manipulation with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised Flow Matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance with language prompter achieves competitive performance and even outperforms other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot trajectories with flow matching policy also leads to consistently better results than alternative behavior cloning methods, including marginally better generalization performance and prominently faster inference than diffusion policy with DDPM. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance model learning and trajectory generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.</description>

      <title>DualAD: Dual-Layer Planning for Reasoning in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel autonomous driving framework, DualAD, designed to imitate human reasoning during driving. DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based motion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring minimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that converts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description. This text is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving decisions. The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when potential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations. Closed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained model, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning abilities. Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text encoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding. Additionally, the integrated DualAD model improves with stronger LLMs, indicating the framework's potential for further enhancement. Code and benchmarks are available at github.com/TUM-AVS/DualAD.</description>

      <title>VoxNeRF: Bridging Voxel Representation and Neural Radiance Fields for Enhanced Indoor View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of high-fidelity view synthesis is essential for robotic navigation and interaction but remains challenging, particularly in indoor environments and real-time scenarios. Existing techniques often require significant computational resources for both training and rendering, and they frequently result in suboptimal 3D representations due to insufficient geometric structuring. To address these limitations, we introduce VoxNeRF, a novel approach that utilizes easy-to-obtain geometry priors to enhance both the quality and efficiency of neural indoor reconstruction and novel view synthesis. We propose an efficient voxel-guided sampling technique that allocates computational resources selectively to the most relevant segments of rays based on a voxel-encoded geometry prior, significantly reducing training and rendering time. Additionally, we incorporate a robust depth loss to improve reconstruction and rendering quality in sparse view settings. Our approach is validated with extensive experiments on ScanNet and ScanNet++ where VoxNeRF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and establishes a new benchmark for indoor immersive interpolation and extrapolation settings.</description>

      <title>Social-Transmotion: Promptable Human Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance systems. Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/vita-epfl/social-transmotion.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Team: Zero-Shot Physical Task Planning with Visual LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19094v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Wonderful Team, a multi-agent Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) framework for executing high level robotic planning in a zero-shot regime. In our context, zero-shot high-level planning means that for a novel environment, we provide a VLLM with an image of the robot's surroundings and a task description, and the VLLM outputs the sequence of actions necessary for the robot to complete the task. Unlike previous methods for high-level visual planning for robotic manipulation, our method uses VLLMs for the entire planning process, enabling a more tightly integrated loop between perception, control, and planning. As a result, Wonderful Team's performance on a real-world semantic and physical planning tasks often exceeds methods that rely on separate vision systems. For example, we see an average 40% success-rate improvement on VimaBench over prior methods such as NLaP, an average 30% improvement over Trajectory Generators on tasks from the Trajectory Generator paper including drawing and wiping a plate, and an average 70% improvement over Trajectory Generators on a new set of semantic reasoning tasks including environment re-arrangement with implicit linguistic constraints. We hope these results highlight the rapid improvements of VLLMs in the past year, and motivate the community to consider VLLMs as an option for some high-level robotic planning problems in the future.</description>
