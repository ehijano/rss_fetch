      <title>Loss of Axial Symmetry in Hypersonic Flows over Conical Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assumption of axial symmetry for hypersonic flows over conically shaped geometries is ubiquitous in both experiments and numerical simulations. Yet depending on the free stream conditions, many of these flows are unsteady and their transition from laminar to turbulent is a three-dimensional phenomena. Combining triple deck theory/linear stability analysis with the kinetic direct simulation Monte Carlo method we analyze the azimuthal eigenmodes of flows over single and double-cone configurations. For Mach 16 flows we find that the strongest amplification rate occurs for the non-axisymmetric azimuthal wavenumber of n = 1. This occurs in regions quite close to the tip of the cone due to the proximity of the conical shock to the viscous shear layer where non-axisymmetric modes are amplified through linear mechanisms. Comparison of triple deck linear stability predictions shows that in addition to the azimuthal wavenumber, both the temporal content and amplification rate of these non-axisymmetric disturbances agree well with the time accurate DSMC flowfield. In addition to the loss of axial symmetry observed at the conical shock, the effect of axial symmetry assumptions on the more complex shock-shock and shock-boundary layer interactions of a flow over a double cone are considered. The results for the separation region show that axisymmetric and three dimensional simulations differ in almost all of the main flow structures. Three dimensional flowfields result in a smaller separation bubble with weaker shocks and three dimensional effects were manifest in the variation in surface parameters in the azimuthal direction as well. Interestingly, the DSMC simulations show that the loss of axial symmetry in the separation region, begins near the cone tip.</description>

      <title>Studies of Transonic Aircraft Flows and Prediction of Initial Buffet Onset Using Large-Eddy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article utilizes the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) paradigm with a physics-based turbulence modeling approach, including a dynamic subgrid-scale model and an equilibrium wall model, to examine the flow over the NASA transonic Common Research Model (CRM), a flow configuration that has been the focus of several AIAA Drag PredictionWorkshops (DPWs). The current work explores sensitivities to laminar-to-turbulent transition, wind tunnel mounting system, grid resolution, and grid topology and suggests current best practices in the context of large-eddy simulations of transonic aircraft flows. It is found that promoting the flow transition to turbulence via an array of cylindrical trip dots, including the sting mounting system in the simulations, and leveraging stranded boundary layer grids all tend to improve the quality of the LES solutions. Non-monotonic grid convergence in the LES calculations is observed to be strongly sensitive to grid topology, and stranded meshes rectify this issue relative to their hexagonal close-packed (HCP) counterparts. The details of the boundary layer profiles both at the leading edge of the wing and within the shock-induced separation bubble are studied, with thicknesses and integral measures reported, providing details about the boundary layer characteristics to turbulence modelers not typically available from complex aircraft flows. Finally, an assessment of the initial buffet prediction capabilities of LES is made in the context of a simpler NACA 0012 flow, with computational predictions showing reasonable agreement with available experimental data for the angle of attack at initial buffet onset and shock oscillation frequency associated with sustained buffet.</description>

      <title>Pressure drop reduction due to coupling between shear-thinning fluid flow and a weakly deformable channel wall: A reciprocal theorem approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem to derive a closed-form expression for the pressure drop reduction due to the coupling between shear-thinning fluid flow and a weakly deformable channel wall. The methodology is applied in parallel to fluids for which the generalized Newtonian viscosity depends on either the shear rate or the shear stress magnitude. The only limitation on the viscosity model is that it allows for a closed-form solution for the axial velocity profile in a straight and rigid channel. The power-law and Ellis viscosity models are considered as featured examples and to enable comparisons to previous works. The analytical expression obtained via the reciprocal theorem shows that the pressure drop reduction under the power-law model can also be obtained from the pressure drop reduction under the Ellis model in the regime of large Carreau number (small Ellis number).</description>

      <title>Flow-acoustic resonance in deep and inclined cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents numerical investigations of flow-acoustic resonances in deep and inclined cavities using wall-resolved large eddy simulations. The study focuses on cavity configurations with an aspect ratio of $D/L = 2.632$, subjected to two Mach numbers of $0.2$ and $0.3$ at three different inclination angles ($\alpha=30^{\circ}$, $60^{\circ}$, and $90^{\circ}$). Fully turbulent boundary layers generated from independent precursor simulations are employed upstream of the cavities. Initial results highlight distinct aeroacoustic responses between inclined and orthogonal cavities, particularly at $M_{\infty}=0.3$, where inclined cavities exhibit stronger resonances at a lower peak frequency ($St\approx 0.27$) compared to the orthogonal cavity. Further analysis reveals that this lower Strouhal number corresponds to a reduced vortex convection speed linked to large shear-layer oscillations. Additionally, the acoustic input-output analysis indicates that the inclined cavities amplify acoustic responses more effectively and exhibit weaker source-sink cancellations compared to the orthogonal cavity. These mechanisms are identified as the primary contributors to the enhanced aeroacoustic responses in the inclined cavities. Finally, this paper proposes that the ratio between acoustic particle displacement and momentum thickness may be used as a criterion to predict the onset of the distinctive resonance at $St\approx 0.27$. It is suggested that the amplified resonances may be linked to a nonlinear mode shift of the first hydrodynamic mode through enhanced shear-layer oscillation taking place when the proposed criterion is met.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Fluid Flow in Helical Pipes Inspired by Shark Intestines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike human intestines, which are long, hollow tubes, the intestines of sharks and rays contain interior helical structures surrounding a cylindrical hole. One function of these structures may be to create asymmetric flow, favoring passage of fluid down the digestive tract, from anterior to posterior. Here, we design and 3D print biomimetic models of shark intestines, in both rigid and deformable materials. We use the rigid models to test which physical parameters of the interior helices (the pitch, the hole radius, the tilt angle, and the number of turns) yield the largest flow asymmetries. These asymmetries exceed those of traditional Tesla valves, structures specifically designed to create flow asymmetry without any moving parts. When we print the biomimetic models in elastomeric materials so that flow can couple to the structure's shape, flow asymmetry is significantly amplified; it is 7-fold larger in deformable structures than in rigid structures. Last, we 3D-print deformable versions of the intestine of a dogfish shark, based on a tomogram of a biological sample. This biomimic produces flow asymmetry comparable to traditional Tesla valves. The ability to influence the direction of a flow through a structure has applications in biological tissues and artificial devices across many scales, from large industrial pipelines to small microfluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy driven motion of non-coalescing inertial drops: microstructure modeling with nearest particle statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the various arrangements that droplets can form within dispersed buoyant emulsions, which we refer to as the study of microstructure. To this end, we have developed a novel algorithm that effectively prevents numerical coalescence between drops while maintaining a reasonable computational cost. This algorithm is integrated into the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method and implemented using the open-source code http://basilisk.fr. Subsequently, we perform Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of statistically steady state mono-disperse buoyant emulsion over a broad range of dimensionless parameters, including the particle volume fraction ($\phi$), the Galileo number ($Ga$) and the viscosity ratio ($\lambda$). We make use of nearest particle statistics to quantify the microstructure properties. As predicted by Zhang et al. (2023), it is demonstrated that the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution can effectively quantify microstructural features such as particle clusters and layers. Specifically, the findings are: (1) In moderately inertial flows ($Ga = 10$), droplets form isotropic clusters. In high inertial regimes ($Ga = 100$), non-isotropic clusters, such as horizontal layers, are more likely to form. (3) The viscosity ratio plays a significant role in determining the microstructure, with droplets that are less viscous or equally viscous as the surrounding fluid tending to form layers preferentially. Overall, our study provides a quantitative measure of the microstructure in terms of $Ga$, $\phi$ and $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Cross-flow oscillations of a circular cylinder with mechanically coupled rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-Induced Vibrations (FIV) of an elastically mounted circular cylinder are investigated by means of two-dimensional simulations. A mechanical coupling between cross-flow translation and rotation provides a single degree-of-freedom system in which the coupled rotational oscillations affect the fluid-structure dynamics. The structural response of this system is investigated exploring the design space spanned by reduced velocity, coupling radius, and phase density ratio. The kinematic coupling introduces the rotation-induced shear layer modifications, as well as an equivalent inertia effect connected to the coupling force. Such a computational campaign is carried out by means of direct numerical simulations with immersed boundary forcing at a Reynolds number equal to 100. The investigated system exhibits the wake-body synchronisation features typical of lock-in for non-rotating cylinders. However, the kinematic coupling provides a novel FIV scenario, in which the oscillation amplitude is magnified in the locked configurations with respect to the forced rotation case. Furthermore, it is found a significant widening of the reduced velocity domain where the lock-in condition takes place. In view of the proposed analyses, it is determined that the coupled rotation guarantees the phase alignment between lift and displacement necessary to sustain the lock-in condition, making the oscillation amplitude grow indefinitely with the reduced velocity. This is inherently achieved due to the rotational shear layer and the added mass contribution, which prevent the exact match between oscillation frequency and system natural frequency in vacuum. The outcomes of this study might potentially lead to innovative water energy harvesters offering larger power outputs and extended optimal operating regions.</description>

      <title>Collective Effects in Breath Figures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breath figures are the complex patterns that form when water vapor condenses into liquid droplets on a surface. The primary question concerning breath figures is how the condensing vapor is allocated between the growth of existing droplets and the nucleation of new ones. Although numerous theoretical studies have concentrated on scenarios resulting in highly polydisperse droplet ensembles, a companion paper [Bouillant {\em et al.}, submitted] demonstrates that nearly monodisperse patterns can be achieved on defect-free substrates in a diffusion-controlled regime. The objective of this work is to present a theoretical framework that elucidates the formation and evolution of nearly-monodisperse patterns in breath figures. We discover that, following a short nucleation phase, the number of droplets remains constant over an extensive range of timescales due to collective effects mediated by the diffusion of vapor. The spatial extent of these diffusive interactions is identified through asymptotic matching, based on which we provide an accurate description of breath figures through a mean-field model. The model accounts for the sub-diffusive growth of droplets as well as for the arrest of nucleating new droplets, and reveal the scaling laws for the droplet density observed in experiments. Finally, droplets expand and ultimately coalesce, which is shown to trigger a scale-free coarsening of the breath figures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When moist air meets a cold surface, it creates a breath figure characterized by numerous small droplets. The central question is how the vapor flux is distributed between the growth of previously condensed drops and the nucleation of new ones. Here, we investigate the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of droplets on soft crosslinked polymer networks. The number of droplets initially remains constant, until drops start to coarsen according to a universal law; both phenomena are explained via the formation of a saturated boundary layer. Although nucleation occurs at a scale where the polymer network resembles a melt, we quantitatively unveil an algebraic sensitivity of the number of droplets on the substrate elasticity. Our findings suggest that nucleation follows a surprisingly low-energy pathway, influenced by the degree of crosslinking. Consequently, breath figures offer a macroscopic approach to probe the molecular characteristics of the polymer interface.</description>

      <title>Identifying feedback directions in the mechanisms driving self-sustained thermoacoustic instability in a single-element rocket combustor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence of high frequency (&gt;1000 Hz) thermoacoustic instability (TAI) sustained by mutual feedback among the acoustic field, heat release rate oscillations, and hydrodynamic oscillations poses severe challenges to the operation and structural integrity of rocket engines. Hence, quantifying the differing levels of feedback between these variables can help uncover the underlying mechanisms behind such high frequency TAI, enabling redesign of combustors to mitigate TAI. However, so far, no concrete method exists to decipher the varying levels of mutual feedback during high-frequency TAI. In the present study, we holistically investigate the mutual influence based on the spatiotemporal directionality among acoustic pressure, heat release rate, hydrodynamic and thermal oscillations during TAI of a single-element rocket engine combustor. Using symbolic transfer entropy (STE), we identify the spatiotemporal direction of feedback interactions between those primary variables when acoustic waves significantly emerge during TAI. We unveil the influence of vorticity dynamics at the fuel collar (or the propellant splitter plate) as the primary stimulant over the heat release rate fluctuations to rapidly amplify the amplitude of the acoustic field. Further, depending on the quantification of the degree of the mutual information (i.e., the net direction of information), we identify the switches in dominating the thermoacoustic driving between the variables during TAI, each representing a distinct mechanism of a thermoacoustic state. Additionally, from this quantification, we analyze the relative dominance of the variables and rank-order the mutual feedback according to their impact on driving TAI.</description>

      <title>Weak baselines and reporting biases lead to overoptimism in machine learning for fluid-related partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising applications of machine learning (ML) in computational physics is to accelerate the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The key objective of ML-based PDE solvers is to output a sufficiently accurate solution faster than standard numerical methods, which are used as a baseline comparison. We first perform a systematic review of the ML-for-PDE solving literature. Of articles that use ML to solve a fluid-related PDE and claim to outperform a standard numerical method, we determine that 79% (60/76) compare to a weak baseline. Second, we find evidence that reporting biases, especially outcome reporting bias and publication bias, are widespread. We conclude that ML-for-PDE solving research is overoptimistic: weak baselines lead to overly positive results, while reporting biases lead to underreporting of negative results. To a large extent, these issues appear to be caused by factors similar to those of past reproducibility crises: researcher degrees of freedom and a bias towards positive results. We call for bottom-up cultural changes to minimize biased reporting as well as top-down structural reforms intended to reduce perverse incentives for doing so.</description>

      <title>Identifying the onset and decay of quasi-stationary families of almost-invariant sets with an application to atmospheric blocking events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic features of dynamical systems such as almost-invariant sets and coherent sets provide crucial high-level information on how the dynamics organises phase space. We introduce a method to identify time-parameterised families of almost-invariant sets in time-dependent dynamical systems, as well as the families' emergence and disappearance. In contrast to coherent sets, which may freely move about in phase space over time, our technique focuses on families of metastable sets that are quasi-stationary in space. Our straightforward approach extends successful transfer operator methods for almost-invariant sets to time-dependent dynamics and utilises the Ulam scheme for the generator of the transfer operator on a time-expanded domain. The new methodology is illustrated with an idealised fluid flow and with atmospheric velocity data. We identify atmospheric blocking events in the 2003 European heatwave and compare our technique to existing geophysical methods of blocking diagnosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary approaches to optical multiple micro-manipulation typically involve careful pre-engineering of the laser beam shape. In various biomedical and microfluidic scenarios, especially those necessitating unconventional specimen chambers, there is a demand for controlling the collection of micro-objects at fluid-fluid interfaces. This requirement arises in contexts such as the transport of materials across liquid interfaces for applications like living cell manipulation, drug delivery, soft functional material creation, and various industrial processes. For many of these cases, a regular array of trap sites as well as tightly confinement are not essential. For such applications at interfaces, we expand on the concept of speckle tweezers (ST), which incorporate randomly distributed light fields for quasi-2D optical manipulation. The proposed technique is demonstrated experimentally by applying ST to govern the movement of PS micro-particles at water-oil and water-air interfaces. The efficacy of the method is validated through the temporal characterization of micro-particle motions using digital video microscopy.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic dip-coating beyond lubrication theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dip-coating geometry, where a solid plate is withdrawn from or plunged into a liquid pool, offers a prototypical example of wetting flows involving contact-line motion. Such flows are commonly studied using the lubrication approximation approach which is intrinsically limited to small interface slopes and thus small contact angles. Flows for arbitrary contact angles, however, can be studied using a generalized lubrication theory that builds upon viscous corner flow solutions. Here we derive this generalized lubrication theory for viscoelastic liquids that exhibit normal stress effects and are modelled using the second-order fluid model. We apply our theory to advancing and receding contact lines in dip-coating, highlighting the influence of viscoelastic normal stresses for contact line motion at arbitrary contact angle.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for inviscid shear instability: Hurdle theorem and its application to alternating jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple method to identify unstable parameter regions in general inviscid unidirectional shear flow stability problems. The theory is applicable to a wide range of basic flows, including those that are non-monotonic. We illustrate the method using a model of Jupiter's alternating jet streams based on the quasi-geostrophic equation. The main result is that the flow is unstable if there is an interval in the flow domain for which the reciprocal Rossby Mach number (a quantity defined in terms of the zonal flow and potential vorticity distribution), surpasses a certain threshold or `hurdle'. The hurdle height approaches unity when we can take the hurdle width to greatly the atmosphere's intrinsic deformation length, as holds on gas giants. In this case, the Kelvin-Arnol'd sufficient condition of stability accurately detects instability. These results improve the theoretical framework for explaining the stable maintenance of Jupiter and Saturn's jets over decadal timescales.</description>

Abstract: Accurately modeling the dynamics of high-density ratio ($\mathcal{O}(10^5)$) two-phase flows is important for many applications in material science and manufacturing. In this work, we consider numerical simulations of molten metal undergoing microgravity oscillations. Accurate simulation of the oscillation dynamics allows us to characterize the interplay between the two fluids' surface tension and density ratio, which is an important consideration for terrestrial manufacturing applications. We present a projection-based computational framework for solving a thermodynamically-consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flows under these large density ratios. A modified version of the pressure-decoupled solver based on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition presented in Khanwale et al. [$\textit{A projection-based, semi-implicit time-stepping approach for the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations on adaptive octree meshes.}$, Journal of Computational Physics 475 (2023): 111874] is used. We present a comprehensive convergence study to investigate the effect of mesh resolution, time-step, and interfacial thickness on droplet-shape oscillations. We deploy our framework to predict the oscillation behavior of three physical systems exhibiting very large density ratios ($10^4-10^5:1$) that have previously never been performed.</description>

      <title>A review on the Vortex and Coherent Structures in Dusty Plasma Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dusty plasma is an admixture of electrons, ions, and massive charged solid particles of sub-micron to micron-sized in the background of neutral gas. The dust grain medium exhibits fluid (liquid) as well as solid-like characteristics at different background plasma conditions. It supports various linear and non-linear dynamical structures because of the external perturbation and internal instabilities. The vortical or coherent structure in the dusty plasma medium is a kind of self-sustained dynamical structure that is formed either by instabilities or external forcing. In this review article, the author discusses the past theoretical, experimental, and computational investigations on vortical and coherent structures in unmagnetized as well as in magnetized dusty plasma. The possible mechanisms to form vortices in dust grain medium are discussed in detail. The studies on the evolution of vortices and their correlation with turbulence are also reviewed.</description>

      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scales of the energy spectrum and the spectral ratio define two characteristic scales, which can be regarded as the integral scale and the dissipation scale of turbulence, respectively, so that the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the energy spectrum's exponent is steeper than both the Kolmogorov and Burgers exponents, indicating more efficient energy transfer compared to Kolmogorov or Burgers turbulence.</description>
