      <title>Comodule Representations of Second-Order Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and investigate a general theory of representations of second-order functionals, based on a notion of a right comodule for a monad on the category of containers. We show how the notion of comodule representability naturally subsumes classic representations of continuous functionals with well-founded trees. We find other kinds of representations by varying the monad, the comodule, and in some cases the underlying category of containers. Examples include uniformly continuous or finitely supported functionals, functionals querying their arguments precisely once, or at most once, functionals interacting with an ambient environment through computational effects, as well as functionals trivially representing themselves. Many of these rely on our construction of a monad on containers from a monad on shapes and a weak Mendler-style monad algebra on the universe for positions. We show that comodule representability on the category of propositional containers, which have positions valued in a universe of propositions, is closely related to instance reducibility in constructive mathematics, and through it to Weihrauch reducibility in computability theory.</description>

      <title>From Innermost to Full Probabilistic Term Rewriting: Almost-Sure Termination, Complexity, and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many evaluation strategies for term rewrite systems, but automatically proving termination or analyzing complexity is usually easiest for innermost rewriting. Several syntactic criteria exist when innermost termination implies full termination or when runtime complexity and innermost runtime complexity coincide. We adapt these criteria to the probabilistic setting, e.g., we show when it suffices to analyze almost-sure termination w.r.t. innermost rewriting in order to prove full almost-sure termination of probabilistic term rewrite systems. These criteria can be applied for both termination and complexity analysis in the probabilistic setting. We implemented and evaluated our new contributions in the tool AProVE. Moreover, we also use our new results on innermost and full probabilistic rewriting to investigate the modularity of probabilistic termination properties.</description>

      <title>Certifying rings of integers in number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Number fields and their rings of integers, which generalize the rational numbers and the integers, are foundational objects in number theory. There are several computer algebra systems and databases concerned with the computational aspects of these. In particular, computing the ring of integers of a given number field is one of the main tasks of computational algebraic number theory. In this paper, we describe a formalization in Lean 4 for certifying such computations. In order to accomplish this, we developed several data types amenable to computation. Moreover, many other underlying mathematical concepts and results had to be formalized, most of which are also of independent interest. These include resultants and discriminants, as well as methods for proving irreducibility of univariate polynomials over finite fields and over the rational numbers. To illustrate the feasibility of our strategy, we formally verified entries from the $\textit{Number fields}$ section of the $\textit{L-functions and modular forms database}$ (LMFDB). These concern, for several number fields, the explicitly given $\textit{integral basis}$ of the ring of integers and the $\textit{discriminant}$. To accomplish this, we wrote SageMath code that computes the corresponding certificates and outputs a Lean proof of the statement to be verified.</description>

      <title>Proof of Thought : Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis allows Robust and Interpretable Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they struggle with inconsistent reasoning, particularly in novel domains and complex logical sequences. This research introduces Proof of Thought, a framework that enhances the reliability and transparency of LLM outputs. Our approach bridges LLM-generated ideas with formal logic verification, employing a custom interpreter to convert LLM outputs into First Order Logic constructs for theorem prover scrutiny. Central to our method is an intermediary JSON-based Domain-Specific Language, which by design balances precise logical structures with intuitive human concepts. This hybrid representation enables both rigorous validation and accessible human comprehension of LLM reasoning processes. Key contributions include a robust type system with sort management for enhanced logical integrity, explicit representation of rules for clear distinction between factual and inferential knowledge, and a flexible architecture that allows for easy extension to various domain-specific applications. We demonstrate Proof of Thought's effectiveness through benchmarking on StrategyQA and a novel multimodal reasoning task, showing improved performance in open-ended scenarios. By providing verifiable and interpretable results, our technique addresses critical needs for AI system accountability and sets a foundation for human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Mold: Nonlinear Ranking Function Synthesis Without Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of synthesizing (lexicographic) polynomial ranking functions for loops that can be described in polynomial arithmetic over integers and reals. While the analogous ranking function synthesis problem for linear arithmetic is decidable, even checking whether a given function ranks an integer loop is undecidable in the nonlinear setting. We side-step the decidability barrier by working within the theory of linear integer/real rings (LIRR) rather than the standard model of arithmetic. We develop a termination analysis that is guaranteed to succeed if a loop (expressed as a formula) admits a (lexicographic) polynomial ranking function. In contrast to template-based ranking function synthesis in real arithmetic, our completeness result holds for lexicographic ranking functions of unbounded dimension and degree, and effectively subsumes linear lexicographic ranking function synthesis for linear integer loops.</description>

      <title>SAT Solving Using XOR-OR-AND Normal Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the XOR-OR-AND normal form (XNF) for logical formulas. It is a generalization of the well-known Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) where literals are replaced by XORs of literals. As a first theoretic result, we show that every CNF formula is equisatisfiable to a formula in 2-XNF, i.e., a formula in XNF where each clause involves at most two XORs of literals. Subsequently, we present an algorithm which converts Boolean polynomials efficiently from their Algebraic Normal Form (ANF) to formulas in 2-XNF. Experiments with the cipher ASCON-128 show that cryptographic problems, which by design are based strongly on XOR-operations, can be represented using far fewer variables and clauses in 2-XNF than in CNF. In order to take advantage of this compact representation, new SAT solvers based on input formulas in 2-XNF need to be designed. By taking inspiration from graph-based 2-CNF SAT solving, we devise a new DPLL-based SAT solver for formulas in 2-XNF. Among others, we present advanced pre- and in-processing techniques. Finally, we give timings for random 2-XNF instances and instances related to key recovery attacks on round reduced ASCON-128, where our solver outperforms state-of-the-art alternative solving approaches.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability Modulo Theories for Verifying MILP Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correctness of results from mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solvers is critical, particularly in the context of applications such as hardware verification, compiler optimization, or machine-assisted theorem proving. To this end, VIPR 1.0 is the first recently proposed general certificate format for answers produced by MILP solvers. We design a schema to encode VIPR's inference rules as a ground formula that completely characterizes the validity of the algorithmic check, removing any ambiguities and imprecisions present in the specification. We implement a checker for VIPR certificates by expressing our ground formula with the Satisfiability Modulo Theory Library (SMT-LIB) and check its validity. Our approach is solver-agnostic, and we test its viability using benchmark instances found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Description Complexity of Unary Structures in First-Order Logic with Links to Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The description complexity of a model is the length of the shortest formula that defines the model. We study the description complexity of unary structures in first-order logic FO, also drawing links to semantic complexity in the form of entropy. The class of unary structures provides, e.g., a simple way to represent tabular Boolean data sets as relational structures. We define structures with FO-formulas that are strictly linear in the size of the model as opposed to using the naive quadratic ones, and we use arguments based on formula size games to obtain related lower bounds for description complexity. For a typical structure the upper and lower bounds in fact match up to a sublinear term, leading to a precise asymptotic result on the expected description complexity of a randomly selected structure. We then give bounds on the relationship between Shannon entropy and description complexity. We extend this relationship also to Boltzmann entropy by establishing an asymptotic match between the two entropies. Despite the simplicity of unary structures, our arguments require the use of formula size games, Stirling's approximation and Chernoff bounds.</description>
