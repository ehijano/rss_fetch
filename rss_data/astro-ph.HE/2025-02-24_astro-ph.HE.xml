      <title>Tension of toroidal magnetic field in reconnection plasmoids and relativistic jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toroidal magnetic field is a key ingredient of relativistic jets launched by certain accreting astrophysical black holes, and of plasmoids emerging from the tearing instability during magnetic reconnection, a candidate dissipation mechanism in jets. Tension of toroidal field is an anisotropic force that can compress local energy and momentum densities. We investigate this effect in plasmoids produced during relativistic reconnection initiated from a Harris layer by means of kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations, varying the system size (including 3D cases), magnetisation, or guide field. We find that: (1) plasmoid cores are dominated by plasma energy density for guide fields up to B_z ~ B_0; (2) relaxed 'monster' plasmoids compress plasma energy density only modestly (by factor ~3 above the initial level for drifting particle population); (3) energy density compressions by factors &gt;~10 are achieved during plasmoid mergers, especially with the emergence of secondary plasmoids. This kinetic-scale effect can be combined with a global focusing of the jet Poynting flux along the quasi-cylindrical bunched spine (a proposed jet layer adjacent to the cylindrical core) due to poloidal line bunching (a prolonged effect of tension of the jet toroidal field) to enhance the luminosity of rapid radiation flares from blazars. The case of M87 as a misaligned blazar is discussed.</description>

      <title>Boosting the growth of intermediate-mass black holes: collisions with massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform fully relativistic simulations of the head-on collisions between intermediate-mass black holes and very massive stars. Such collisions are expected to occur in dense stellar clusters and may play an important role in growing the mass of the seed black hole. For the cases considered here, for which the masses of the black holes and stars are comparable, the vast majority of the stellar material is accreted onto the black hole within a stellar dynamical timescale, as expected from analytical estimates, and leads to a rapid growth of the black hole. A small amount of mass, which is shock-heated in the wake of the black hole, is ejected from the collision and will contribute to the interstellar material in the cluster.</description>

      <title>3D Adiabatic Simulations of Binary Black Hole Formation in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate close encounters between initially unbound black holes (BHs) in the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN), performing the first 3D non-isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of gas-assisted binary BH formation. We discuss a suite of 135 simulations, considering 9 AGN disc environments and 15 BH impact parameters. We find that the gas distribution within the Hill sphere about an isolated embedded BH is akin to a spherically symmetric star with a low-mass convective envelope and a BH core, with large convective currents driving strong outflows away from the midplane. We find that Coriolis force acting on the outflow results in winds, analogous to cyclones, that counter-rotate with respect to the midplane flow within the Hill sphere. We confirm the existence of strong thermal blasts due to minidisc collisions during BH close encounters, as predicted in our previous 2D studies. We document binary formation across a wide range of environments, finding formation likelihood is increased when the gas mass in the Hill sphere is large, allowing for easier binary formation in the outer AGN disc. We provide a comprehensive overview of the SMBH's role in binary formation, investigating how binary formation in intermediate density environments is biased towards certain binary orientations. We offer two models for predicting dissipation by gas during close encounters, as a function of the ambient Hill mass alone, or with the periapsis depth. We use these models to motivate a prescription for binary formation likelihood that can be readily applied to Monte-Carlo simulations of AGN evolution.</description>

      <title>Long-term impact of the magnetic-field strength on the evolution and electromagnetic emission by neutron-star merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are essential to understand the complex physics accompanying the merger of binary systems of neutron stars. However, these simulations become computationally challenging when they have to model the merger remnants on timescales over which secular phenomena, such as the launching of magnetically driven outflows, develop. To tackle these challenges, we have recently developed a hybrid approach that combines, via a hand-off transition, a fully general-relativistic code (FIL) with a more efficient code making use of the conformally flat approximation (BHAC+). We here report important additional developments of BHAC+ consisting of the inclusion of gravitational-wave radiation-reaction contributions and of higher-order formulations of the equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Both improvements have allowed us to explore BNS merger remnants with high accuracy and over timescales that would have been computationally prohibitive otherwise. More specifically, we have investigated the impact of the magnetic-field strength on the long-term (\ie $\sim 200\,{\rm ms}$) and high-resolution (\ie $150\,{\rm m}$) evolutions of the ``magnetar'' resulting from the merger of two neutron stars with a realistic equation of state. In this way, and for sufficiently large magnetic fields, we observe the weakening or suppression of differential rotation and the generation of magnetic flares in the outer layers of the remnant. These flares, driven mostly by the Parker instability, are responsible for intense and collimated Poynting flux outbursts and mass ejections. This novel phenomenology offers the possibility of seeking corresponding signatures from the observations of short gamma-ray bursts and hence revealing the existence of a long-lived strongly magnetized remnant.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for AGN Accretion and Jet Feedback in Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, especially due to relativistic jets, is crucial for understanding the cool-core problem in galaxy clusters. We present a new subgrid method to model accretion onto and feedback from AGN in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. Instead of applying the traditional Bondi formalism, we use a sink particle algorithm in which the accretion flux is measured directly through a control surface. A weighting kernel is used to reset the gas properties within the accretion radius at the end of each timestep. We implement feedback in the form of bipolar jets whose properties are tied to the accretion rate. The method is tested with a spherically symmetric Bondi gas flow problem and a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton wind problem, with and without jet feedback. We discuss the reliability of this model by comparing our jet simulations with those in the literature, and we examine the dependence of test results on parameters such as the resolution and size of the jet injection region. We find that the sink particle model can account for the $\alpha$ factor in accretion measurement, and the accretion radius must be resolved with at least two zones to produce realistic black hole accretion. We also show how under-resolving the AGN feedback region in simulations can impact the feedback energy deposited and the jet dynamics. The code described here is the framework for a feedback model, described in a companion paper, that will use accretion disk modeling to more self-consistently determine the feedback efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Critical Examination of the Nested Leaky Box Model for Galactic Cosmic Ray Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the predictions of the nested leaky box model in detail, in terms of both primary cosmic-ray spectra, spectra of stable and unstable nuclei and antimatter production (positrons and antiprotons). We conclude that the model is in direct conflict with several observational facts and at least in its vanilla version should be considered as ruled out by current data. We also speculate on some possibly interesting implications of the idea that at least a fraction of Galactic grammage may not be accumulated in the journey of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium but rather inside the sources or in regions around them. These speculations will become increasingly more relevant with the higher precision data becoming available at high energies.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency Radio Observations of the Magnetar Swift J1818.0--1607</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on Green Bank Telescope observations of the radio magnetar Swift J1818.0--1607 between 820 MHz and 35 GHz, taken from six to nine months after its 2020 March outburst. We obtained multi-hour observations at six frequencies, recording polarimetric, spectral, and single-pulse information. The spectrum peaks at a frequency of $5.4 \pm 0.6$ GHz, making Swift J1818.0--1607 one of many radio magnetars which exhibit a gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS). The radio flux decays steeply above the peak frequency, with in-band spectral indices $\alpha &lt; -2.3 $ above 9 GHz. The emission is highly ($&gt; 50\%$) linearly polarized, with a lower degree ($&lt; 30\%$) of circular polarization which can change handedness between single pulses. Across the frequency range of our observations, the time-integrated radio profiles share a common shape: a narrow ``pulsar-like'' central component flanked by ``magnetar-like'' components comprised of bright, spiky subpulses. The outer profile components exhibit larger degrees of flux modulation and flatter spectral indices when compared to the central pulse component.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian estimation of population-level torque law parameters from anomalous pulsar braking indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abridged. Stochastic fluctuations in the spin frequency $\nu$ of a rotation-powered pulsar affect how accurately one measures the power-law braking index, $n_{\rm pl}$, defined through $\dot{\nu}=K\nu^{n_{\rm pl}}$, and can lead to measurements of anomalous braking indices, with $\vert n \vert = \vert \nu \ddot{\nu}/ \dot{\nu}^{2} \vert \gg1$, where the overdot symbolizes a derivative with respect to time. Previous studies show that the variance of the measured $n$ obeys the predictive, falsifiable formula $\langle n^{2} \rangle = n_{\rm pl}^{2}+\sigma^{2}_{\ddot{\nu}}\nu^{2}\gamma_{\ddot{\nu}}^{-2}\dot{\nu}^{-4}T_{\rm obs}^{-1}$ for $\dot{K}=0$, where $\sigma_{\ddot{\nu}}$ is the timing noise amplitude, $\gamma_{\ddot{\nu}}^{-1}$ is a stellar damping time-scale, and $T_{\rm obs}$ is the total observing time. Here we combine this formula with a hierarchical Bayesian scheme to infer the population-level distribution of $n_{\rm pl}$ for a pulsar population of size $M$. The scheme is validated using synthetic data. For a plausible test population with $M=100$ and injected $n_{\rm pl}$ values drawn from a population-level Gaussian with mean $\mu_{\rm pl}=4$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm pl}=0.5$, intermediate between electromagnetic braking and mass quadrupole gravitational radiation reaction, the Bayesian scheme infers $\mu_{\rm pl}=3.89^{+0.24}_{-0.23}$ and $\sigma_{\rm pl}=0.43^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$. The $M=100$ per-pulsar posteriors for $n_{\rm pl}$ and $\sigma^{2}_{\ddot{\nu}}\gamma_{\ddot{\nu}}^{-2}$ contain $87\%$ and $69\%$, respectively, of the injected values within their $90\%$ credible intervals. Comparable accuracy is achieved for (i) population sizes spanning the range $50 \leq M \leq 300$, and (ii) wide priors satisfying $\mu_{\rm pl} \leq 10^{3}$ and $\sigma_{\rm pl} \leq 10^{2}$, which accommodate plausible spin-down mechanisms with $\dot{K}\neq0$.</description>

      <title>A Stacked Analysis of GeV Gamma-Ray Emission from SPT-SZ Galaxy Clusters with 16 Years of Fermi-LAT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a statistically significant detection of cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission from a stacked sample of SPT-SZ selected galaxy clusters using 16.4 years of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope's Large Area Telescope (LAT). By analyzing a population of clusters with individual Test Statistic (TS) values $&lt;$ 9.0, we identify a robust cumulative signal with a TS of 75.2, corresponding to approximately 8.4$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, clusters with TS $&lt;$ 4.0 yield a weaker cumulative signal of TS = 9.65, consistent with background fluctuations. The derived $\gamma$-ray spectrum is well characterized by a power law model with a best-fit spectral index of $-2.59 \pm 0.20$ and an integrated flux of $1.67^{+1.35}_{-1.07} \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The spectral index matches hadronic cosmic-ray interaction predictions but may also include contributions from AGNs within the galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Search for High Energy Neutrino Sources using IceCube Neutrino Events and \textit{Fermi}/LAT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos remain largely unknown. Multi-wavelength observational campaignshave identified a few plausible candidates, but their numbers are limited.
  Aims. We search for an excess of high-energy neutrino events originating from the directions of blazar sources, compared to the expected background. Additionally, we investigate blazars located within a small angular distance from the arrival directions of high-energy neutrinos, analyzing their characteristics to assess their plausibility as neutrino sources.
  Methods. We generate random samples of events following the right ascension and the declination distributions of the high-energy neutrino events detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and count the coincidences of generated samples as well as the true observations with the Fermi-LAT blazar sources. Furthermore, we conduct temporal analysis of gamma-ray light curves and spectral analysis of blazar sources with the highest clustering of neutrino events.
  Results. We find an excess of high-energy neutrino events from the directions of Fermi blazars beyond random coincidence, with a significance of 2.42$\sigma$. Among the nine blazars which have a maximum number of neutrino events (four) arriving from within 3 degrees from them, 4FGL J1012.3+0629 exhibits the most significant variability around the neutrino detection time. Our study identifies 4FGL J1012.3+0629, 4FGL J2118.0+0019, 4FGL J2226.8+0051 and 4FGL J2227.9+0036 as plausible high-energy neutrino source candidates. The neutrino events IC110726A, IC170308A, IC190415A, IC141210A, IC150102A, IC230524A, IC140114A, IC110807A, and IC200523A likely originate from these sources. Additionally, we find that the spectral index tends to harden when these high-energy neutrino events are detected.</description>

      <title>New insight into the Rapid Burster by Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the timing and spectral analyses upon of the type II X-ray bursts from the Rapid Burster (MXB 1730--335) observed by Insight-HXMT and Swift/XRT. By stacking the long-duration bursts, we find for the first time that the hard X-rays are lagging than the soft X-rays by 3 seconds. However, such a lag is not visible for the short-duration bursts, probably because of the poor statistics. For all bursts the energy spectrum is found to be non-thermal, thanks to the broad band coverage of Insight-HXMT. These findings put new insights into the type-II bursts and require a temporally showing-up corona for possible interpretation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Pulsar Wind Nebula Candidate Associated with the Galactic PeVatron 1LHAASO J0343+5254u</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astronomical origin of the most energetic galactic cosmic rays and gamma rays is still uncertain. X-ray followup of candidate "PeVatrons", systems producing cosmic rays with energies exceeding 1 PeV, can constrain their spatial origin, identify likely counterparts, and test particle emission models. Using 120 ks of XMM-Newton observations, we report the discovery of a candidate pulsar wind nebula, a possible counterpart for the LHAASO PeVatron J0343+5254u. This extended source has a power law X-ray spectrum with spectral index of 1.9 - softer at greater distance from the center - and asymmetric spatial extension out to 2'. We conduct leptonic modeling of the X-ray and gamma ray radiation from this complex system, showing that a fully leptonic model with elevated IR photon fields can explain the multiwavelength emission from this source, similar to other VHE pulsar wind nebulae; excess gamma ray emissivity not explained by a leptonic model may be due to hadronic interactions in nearby molecular cloud regions, which might also produce detectable astroparticle flux.</description>

Abstract: We report a new CO observation survey of LHAASO J0341$+$5258 using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO) 45-m telescope. LHAASO J0341$+$5258 is one of the unidentified ultra-high-energy (UHE; E $&gt;$100 TeV) gamma-ray sources detected by LHAASO. Our CO observations were conducted in February and March 2024, with a total observation time of 36 hours, covering the LHAASO source ($\sim$0.3-0.5 degrees in radius) and its surrounding area (1$\times$1.5 degrees). Within the LHAASO source extent, we identified five compact ($&lt;$ 2 pc) molecular clouds at nearby distances ($&lt;$ 1-4 kpc). These clouds can serve as proton-proton collision targets, producing hadronic gamma rays via neutral pion decays. Based on the hydrogen densities (700-5000 cm$^{-3}$) estimated from our CO observations and archived HI data from the DRAO survey, we derived the total proton energy of $W_p$ (E $&gt;$ 1 TeV) $\sim$ 10$^{45}$ erg to account for the gamma-ray flux. One of the molecular clouds appears to be likely associated with an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star with an extended CO tail, which may indicate some particle acceleration activities. However, the estimated maximum particle energy below 100 TeV makes the AGB-like star unlikely to be a PeVatron site. We conclude that the UHE emission observed in LHAASO J0341$+$5258 could be due to hadronic interactions between the newly discovered molecular clouds and TeV-PeV protons originating from a distant SNR or due to leptonic emission from a pulsar wind nebula candidate, which is reported in our companion X-ray observation paper (DiKerby et al. 2025).</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy {\gamma}-ray emission associated with the tail of a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of an unidentified point-like ultra-high-energy (UHE) $\gamma$-ray source, designated as 1LHAASO J1740+0948u, situated in the vicinity of the middle-aged pulsar PSR J1740+1000. The detection significance reached 17.1$\sigma$ (9.4$\sigma$) above 25$\,$TeV (100$\,$TeV). The source energy spectrum extended up to 300$\,$TeV, which was well fitted by a log-parabola function with $N0 = (1.93\pm0.23) \times 10^{-16} \rm{TeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-2}}$, $\alpha = 2.14\pm0.27$, and $\beta = 1.20\pm0.41$ at E0 = 30$\,$TeV. The associated pulsar, PSR J1740+1000, resides at a high galactic latitude and powers a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (BSPWN) with an extended X-ray tail. The best-fit position of the gamma-ray source appeared to be shifted by $0.2^{\circ}$ with respect to the pulsar position. As the (i) currently identified pulsar halos do not demonstrate such offsets, and (ii) centroid of the gamma-ray emission is approximately located at the extension of the X-ray tail, we speculate that the UHE $\gamma$-ray emission may originate from re-accelerated electron/positron pairs that are advected away in the bow-shock tail.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger detection of black hole binaries in dark matter spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inspiral of a high mass-ratio black hole binary located in the nucleus of a galaxy, where the primary central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter spike formed through accretion during the black hole growth phase. Within this spike, dark matter undergoes strong self-annihilation, producing a compact source of $\gamma$-ray radiation that is highly sensitive to spike density, while the binary emits gravitational waves at frequencies detectable by LISA. As the inspiralling binary interacts with the surrounding dark matter particles, it alters the density of the spike, thereby influencing the $\gamma$-ray flux from dark matter annihilation. We demonstrate that the spike self-annihilation luminosity decreases by $10\%$ to $90\%$ of its initial value, depending on the initial density profile and binary mass ratio, as the binary sweeps through the LISA band. This presents a new opportunity to indirectly probe dark matter through multi-messenger observations of galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Forward Shock Velocities of the Supernova Remnant N132D Based on the Thermal X-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring shock velocities is crucial for understanding the energy transfer processes at the shock fronts of supernova remnants (SNRs), including acceleration of cosmic rays. Here we present shock velocity measurements on the SNR N132D, based on the thermal properties of the shock-heated interstellar medium. We apply a self-consistent model developed in our previous work to X-ray data from deep Chandra observations with an effective exposure of $\sim$ 900 ks. In our model, both temperature and ionization relaxation processes in post-shock plasmas are simultaneously calculated, so that we can trace back to the initial condition of the shock-heated plasma to constrain the shock velocity. We reveal that the shock velocity ranges from 800 to 1500 $\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ with moderate azimuthal dependence. Although our measurement is consistent with the velocity determined by independent proper motion measurements in the south rim regions, a large discrepancy between the two measurements (up to a factor of 4) is found in the north rim regions. This implies that a substantial amount of the kinetic energy has been transferred to the nonthermal component through highly efficient particle acceleration. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the $\gamma$-ray observations of this SNR.</description>

      <title>High-redshift quasars at $z \geq 3$ -- III. Parsec-scale jet properties from VLBI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide key insights into early supermassive black hole growth and cosmic evolution. This study investigates the parsec-scale properties of 86 radio-loud quasars at z $\geq$ 3 using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. Our results show predominantly compact core and core-jet morphologies, with 35\% unresolved cores, 59\% core-jet structures, and only 6\% core-double jet morphology. Brightness temperatures are generally lower than expected for highly radiative sources. The jet proper motions are surprisingly slow compared to lower-redshift samples. We observe a high fraction of young and/or confined peak-spectrum sources, providing insights into early AGN evolution in dense environments during early cosmic epochs. The observed trends may reflect genuine evolutionary changes in AGN structure over cosmic time, or selection effects favoring more compact sources at higher redshifts. These results stress the complexity of high-redshift radio-loud AGN populations and emphasize the need for multi-wavelength, high-resolution observations to fully characterize their properties and evolution through cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the origin of fast radio bursts by modeling the stellar mass and star formation distributions of their host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse formation channels have been proposed to explain the emergence of fast radio bursts (FRBs), yet their origin remains elusive. With improved localization precision, roughly 90 FRBs are now associated with host galaxies. SED fitting to the host galaxy photometry reveals their stellar masses ($M_\star$) and star formation rates (SFRs), enabling discrimination between various formation channels. We conduct an extensive comparison of the stellar mass, SFR and z distributions of 51 FRB hosts and mock-generated galaxy samples to test whether FRBs trace SFR or $M_\star$. We incorporate a mass-to-light ratio prescription to address optical selection biases. In line with Sharma et al. (2024), we provide evidence in favor of FRB progenitors tracking SF rather than stellar mass. We show that the shape of the assumed $(M_\star/L_r)_{obs}$ distribution affects the predictions, bringing the low mass end of the stellar mass distribution closer to the data when accounting for the $\mathrm{SFR} - (M_\star/L_r)_{obs}$ correlation. The K-correction effect in the $r-$band is minimal for galaxies at $z \lesssim 0.7$. Even if FRBs trace SF, up to $\sim30\%$ of a flux-limited FRB host sample can reside below the star-forming main sequence. Finally, we examine a hybrid model in which a fraction of FRBs tracks stellar mass rather than SF. This fraction can be as large as $\sim(40-50)\%$, suggesting that multiple formation channels are still consistent with observations. The toolkit developed in this work is publicly available (GALFRB code), offering a straightforward way to generate mock galaxy samples suitable for direct comparisons with future FRB host galaxy data.</description>

      <title>A Search for Dark Matter Annihilation in Stellar Streams with the Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams are remnants of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies that have been tidally disrupted by the gravitational potential of their host galaxy. Streams originating from dwarfs can be particularly compelling targets for indirect dark matter (DM) searches, as dwarfs are believed to be highly DM-dominated systems. Although these streams are expected to lose most of their DM during the tidal stretching process, a significant amount may still remain in their core. If DM is composed of WIMPs, their annihilation within the streams' cores could produce a detectable gamma-ray signal. In this study, we analyze nearly 15 years of data from the Large Area Telescope aboard NASA's Fermi satellite (Fermi-LAT) to search for potential WIMP annihilation signals from the direction of 11 stellar streams selected using DM-motivated criteria. No gamma-ray emission is detected from any of the streams in our sample. In the absence of a signal, we place the first constraints on the WIMP parameter space based on these objects for two representative annihilation channels. Individual DM limits are first computed and then combined across all streams. The most reliable combined constraints, derived from a golden sample and using a benchmark description of their DM content, are $O(10)$ times above the thermal relic cross-section for the $bb$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ annihilation channels. We also explore how these constraints vary under more conservative or optimistic yet realistic assumptions, finding variations of up to a few orders of magnitude. This large systematic uncertainty stems from key model limitations, which can and should be addressed in future observations and simulations to produce more robust DM limits from streams. Despite uncertainties, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using stellar streams for DM searches and highlights their significant potential to uncover the properties of DM particles.</description>

      <title>A new mass estimate method with hydrodynamical atmospheres for very massive WNh stars</title>

Abstract: Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of $M_\mathrm{Hydro}$ of 233 Msun. Remarkably, the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind mass loss.</description>

      <title>Modeling Compact Objects in $f(R)$ Gravity: Application of Buchdahl-I Metric with Chaplygin Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates realistic anisotropic matter configurations for spherical symmetry in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. The solutions obtained from Buchdahl-I metric are used to determine the behavior of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0348+0432 and 4U 1608-52 with Starobinsky model. Analysis of physical parameters such as density, pressure, and anisotropy is illustrated through graphs, and the stability of compact objects is investigated by energy and causality conditions. We will also discuss the behavior of gravitational, hydrostatic and anisotropic forces, gravitational redshift and adiabatic index. At the theoretical and astrophysical scales, the graphical representations validate the practical and realistic $f(R)$ gravity models.</description>

      <title>Implications of Photon Mass: Vortextrap Magnetization of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss certain astrophysical implications of the photon mass. It offers a new mechanism of black hole magnetization, described as ``vortextrap magnetization" (VTM), which can generate a near-saturated magnetic field in astrophysical black holes. The extreme magnetic field is provided by a large number of Nielsen-Olesen type vortex lines piercing a black hole. In massive photon scenario the galactic magnetic field is a densely populated forest of overlapping magnetic flux tubes. These get trapped and collected by a black hole over a cosmological time-scale. The VTM mechanism neatly fits supermassive black holes with sizes matching the phenomenologically-acceptable values of the photon mass, and has implications for magnetic-field based particle acceleration. Even in absence of surrounding plasma, the near-saturated magnetic field is expected to result into an intense electromagnetic radiation as well as gravitational waves in black hole mergers. We provide a numerical simulation of the VTM phenomenon in a prototype system.</description>

      <title>Massive vector field perturbations in the Schwarzschild spacetime from supersymmetric gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The master equation of the Proca field in the Schwarzschild spacetime is studied by using the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal modes duality. We establish the dictionary between the parameters in gauge and gravity theories, since both sides lead to Heun-type equations. Applying the technique of instanton counting, we analytically find the eigenfrequencies of the quasinormal modes and quasi-bound states for massive vector fields around black holes, with the boundary conditions linked by the connection formula. The results show consistency with known numerical researches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Return of 4U~1730--22 after 49 years silence: the spectral properties of the 2021/2022 outbursts observed by NICER and Insight-HXMT and the soft-to-hard state transition caused by the propeller effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After in quiescence for 49 years, 4U~1730--22 became active and had two outbursts in 2021 \&amp; 2022, the onset and tail of the outbursts were observed by NICER, which give us a peerless opportunity to study the state transition and its underlying mechanism. In this work, we take both the NS surface and accretion disk emission as the seed photons of the Comptonization and derive their spectral evolution in a bolometric luminosity range of 1\%--15\%$L_{\rm Edd}$. In the high/soft state, the inferred inner disk radius and the NS radius are consistent well, which implies that the accretion disk is close to the NS surface. For the decay stage, we report a steep change of the accretion disk emission within one day, i.e., the soft-to-hard transition, which could be due to the propeller effect and the corresponding neutron star surface magnetic field is 1.8--2.2$\times10^{8}$ G. Moreover, the inner disk radius is truncated at the corotation radius, which is similar to the propeller effect detected from 4U~1608--52. The absence of the propeller effect in the hard-to-soft state transition implies that the transition between the magnetospheric accretion and the disk accretion is not the sole cause of the state transitions.</description>

      <title>Ninety percent circular polarization detected in a repeating fast radio burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extra-galactic sources with unknown physical mechanisms. They emit millisecond-duration radio pulses with isotropic equivalent energy of $10^{36}\sim10^{41}$ ergs. This corresponds to a brightness temperature of FRB emission typically reaching the level of $10^{36}$ K, but can be as high as above $10^{40}$ K for sub-microsecond timescale structures, suggesting the presence of underlying coherent relativistic radiation mechanisms. Polarization carries the key information to understand the physical origin of FRBs, with linear polarization usually tracing the geometric configuration of magnetic fields and circular polarization probing both intrinsic radiation mechanisms and propagation effects. Here we show that the repeating sources FRB 20201124A emits $90.9\pm 1.1\%$ circularly polarized radio pulses. Such a high degree of circular polarization was unexpected in theory and unprecedented in observation in the case of FRBs, since such a high degree of circular polarization was only common among Solar or Jovian radio activities, attributed to the sub-relativistic electrons. We note that there is no obvious correlation between the degree of circular polarization and burst fluence. Besides the high degree of circular polarization, we also detected rapid swing and orthogonal jump in the position angle of linear polarization. The detection of the high degree circular polarization in FRB 20201124A, together with its linear polarization properties that show orthogonal modes, place strong constraints on FRB physical mechanisms, calling for an interplay between magnetospheric radiation and propagation effects in shaping the observed FRB radiation.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Gamma-ray Burst Phenomenology on the Hypothesis of Quark Star as the central engines of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03610v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a strange quark star (QS) predicted in the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis has been a matter of debate. The combustion from a neutron star to a strange QS in its accreted process in a low-mass X-ray binary is proposed to be a scenario that generates gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); the baryon contamination of the outflow is very low and mainly from the masses of crusts ($M_{\rm crust}$) of QSs. A special subset of GRBs detected in the past 16 years are collected and used to estimate $M_{\rm crust}$ under this assumption of QSs as central engines. Correspondingly, $M_{\rm crust}$ is calculated in the frameworks of several models for cold dense quark matter (MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with or without the impacts from the formation of color superconducting condensates being considered), for comparison with the observation. In conclusion, we find that the GRB samples have so far failed to provide positive support for this hypothesis, and the NJL model in which the existence of hybrid stars is allowed might be more consistent with the observation.</description>

      <title>Survey of Radiative, Two-Temperature Magnetically Arrested Simulations of the Black Hole M87* I: Turbulent Electron Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a set of eleven two-temperature, radiative, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (2TGRRMHD) simulations of the black hole M87* in the magnetically arrested (MAD) state, surveying different values of the black hole spin $a_*$. Our 3D simulations self-consistently evolve the temperatures of separate electron and ion populations under the effects of adiabatic compression/expansion, viscous heating, Coulomb coupling, and synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton radiation. We adopt a sub-grid heating prescription from gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence. Our simulations have accretion rates $\dot{M}=(0.5-1.5)\times10^{-6}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ and radiative efficiencies $\epsilon_{\rm rad}=3-35\%$. We compare our simulations to a fiducial set of otherwise identical single-fluid GRMHD simulations and find no significant changes in the outflow efficiency or black hole spindown parameter. Our simulations produce an effective adiabatic index for the two-temperature plasma of $\Gamma_{\rm gas}\approx1.55$, larger than the $\Gamma_{\rm gas}=13/9$ value often adopted in single-fluid GRMHD simulations. We find moderate ion-to-electron temperature ratios in the 230 GHz emitting region of $R=T_{\rm i}/T_{\rm e}{\approx}5$. While total intensity 230 GHz images from our simulations are consistent with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results, our images have significantly more beam-scale linear polarization ($\langle|m|\rangle\approx 30\%$) than is observed in EHT images of M87* ($\langle|m|\rangle&lt;10\%$). We find a trend of the average linear polarization pitch angle $\angle\beta_2$ with black hole spin consistent with what is seen in single-fluid GRMHD simulations, and we provide a simple fitting function for $\angle\beta_2(a_*)$ motivated by the wind-up of magnetic field lines by black hole spin in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.</description>

      <title>Coping with loss: Stability of mass transfer from post-main sequence donor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of mass transfer is critical in determining pathways towards various kinds of compact binaries, such as compact main-sequence white-dwarf binaries, and transients, such as double white-dwarf mergers and luminous red novae. Despite its importance, only very few systematic studies of the stability of mass transfer exist. Using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, we study the behaviour of mass-losing post-main-sequence donor stars with masses between $1 M_{\odot}$ and $8 M_{\odot}$ in binaries, without assuming that the donor star responds to mass loss adiabatically . We treat the accretor as a point mass, which we do not evolve, and assume the mass transfer is conservative. We find that the criterion that best predicts the onset of runaway mass transfer is based on the transition to an effectively adiabatic donor response to mass loss. We find that the critical mass ratio $q_{\rm qad} \sim 0.25$ for stars crossing the Hertzsprung gap, while for convective giants $q_{\rm qad}$ decreases from $\sim 1$ at the base of the RGB to $\sim 0.1$ at the the onset of thermal pulses on the AGB. An effectively adiabatic response of the donor star only occurs at a very high critical mass-transfer rate due to the short local thermal timescale in the outermost layers of a red giant. For $q &gt; q_{\rm qad}$ mass transfer is self-regulated, but for evolved giants the resulting mass-transfer rates can be so high that the evolution becomes dynamical and/or the donor can overflow its outer lobe. Our results indicate that mass transfer is stable for a wider range of binary parameter space than typically assumed in rapid binary population synthesis and found in recent similar studies. Moreover, we find a systematic dependence of the critical mass ratio on the donor star mass and radius which may have significant consequences for predictions of post-mass-transfer populations.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in halos of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the (axial) quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in generic matter profiles. Our results reveal that the axial QNMs experience a redshift when the black hole is surrounded by various matter environments, proportional to the compactness of the matter halo. Our calculations demonstrate that for static black holes embedded in galactic matter distributions, there exists a universal relation between the matter environment and the redshifted vacuum quasinormal modes. In particular, for dilute environments the leading order effect is a redshift $1+U$ of frequencies and damping times, with $U \sim -{\cal C}$ the Newtonian potential of the environment at its center, which scales with its compactness ${\cal C}$.</description>
