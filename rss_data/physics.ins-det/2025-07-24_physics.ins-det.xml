      <title>SPLENDOR: a novel detector platform to search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional position reconstruction of orthogonal-strip planar high-purity germanium detectors using maximum likelihood estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal-strip planar high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors can reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) positions of photon interactions through analysis of parameters extracted from multiple charge signals. The conventional method independently reconstructs positions in each dimension using amplitude-based parameters, leading to noise sensitivity and systematic biases. In this study, we propose a multi-parameter-joint reconstruction method based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which establishes a mapping between pulse shape parameters and corresponding 3D positions. To mitigate the effects of electronic noise, we employ integral-based parameters. The reconstruction performance was evaluated using pulse shape simulations. For 100 keV photons under 1 keV root-mean-square (RMS) electronic noise, the maximum Z reconstruction bias was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.02 mm in the central region and from 2 mm to 0.15 mm near the electrodes. The maximum reconstruction bias in the X/Y directions was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.016 mm. Furthermore, the use of integral-based parameters mitigated the rapid degradation of resolution under high-noise conditions. The achieved position resolution ranged from 0.07 mm to 0.16 mm in the Z directions and from 0.07 mm to 0.44 mm in the X/Y direction. This method offers a promising approach to 3D position reconstruction with HPGe detectors for applications such as medical imaging and gamma-ray astronomy.</description>

      <title>Reducing suspension control noise with interferometric sensors -- an experimental concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the limiting noise sources of ground-based gravitational wave detectors at frequencies below 30 Hz is control-induced displacement noise. Compact laser interferometric sensors are a prime candidate for improved local displacement sensing. In this paper we present the design of an experiment that aims to demonstrate the advantages of interferometric sensors over shadow sensors. We focus on the compact balanced readout interferometer (COBRI) - a sensor currently in development that is based on deep frequency modulation. We mount COBRIs on two HAM Relay Triple Suspension (HRTS) systems that suspend two mirrors forming an optical cavity. By measuring the length stability of this cavity relative to a stable reference we aim to probe the direct motion reduction when using COBRIs for active damping and we aim to investigate their behavior and auxiliary functions, such as absolute ranging, in the context of the 6 degree-of-freedom controls of the suspensions. Here we describe the design of the experiment and simulations of the achievable noise levels that were obtained using mechanical models of the HRTS suspensions. We discuss all relevant noise sources, the modeled influence of the interferometric sensor damping and the current limitations and necessary improvements of our testing facility in terms of seismic pre-isolation to achieve a shadow sensor limited noise at around 5 Hz, where, according to our simulations, we can demonstrate superior performance for COBRIs in the longitudinal degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Lateral Amorphous Selenium Photodetectors for Low-Photon and VUV Detection at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of amorphous selenium (a-Se) as a cryogenic photodetector material is evaluated through a series of experiments using laterally structured devices operated in a custom optical test stand. These studies investigate the response of a-Se detectors to low-photon fluxes at high electric fields near avalanche conditions, the linearity of the photoconductive response over a wide dynamic range and the direct detection of narrowband 130 nm vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) illumination. At 87 K, matched-filter analysis shows reliable single-shot detection with efficiencies greater than or equal to 80 percent and area under the curve (AUC) greater than or equal to 0.85 using as few as approximately 6800 incident 401 nm photons, corresponding to approximately 3400 photons within field-active regions after accounting for geometric constraints. Measurements are performed at cryogenic temperatures using calibrated photon fluxes derived from a silicon photomultiplier reference and a characterized optical filter stack. Additional experiments using a tellurium-doped a-Se (a-SeTe) device explore the material's behavior under identical test conditions and demonstrate that avalanche is achievable in a-SeTe at cryogenic temperatures. The results demonstrate reproducible low-noise operation, VUV sensitivity and field-dependent gain behavior in a lateral a-Se architecture, representing the first reported observation of avalanche multiplication in laterally structured a-Se and a-SeTe devices at cryogenic temperatures. These findings support the potential integration of laterally structured a-Se devices into next-generation pixelated liquid-argon time projection chambers (TPCs) requiring scalable, high-field-compatible photon detection systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of PID Performance at CEPC and Optimization with Combined dN/dx and Time-of-Flight Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of charged-hadron particle identification (PID) at the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), based on full simulation of hadronic $Z$-pole events. A unified PID strategy is developed by combining energy loss measurements (dN/dx) from the time projection chamber (TPC) and time-of-flight (ToF) information from both the inner (ITK) and outer (OTK) silicon trackers. The PID discriminant is constructed using residuals between measured and expected observables under multiple particle hypotheses, with identification regions optimized to maximize kaon efficiency and purity across bins of momentum and polar angle. Results show that the TPC alone, while highly efficient (99.3%), suffers from severe pion-induced contamination, yielding only 14.3% purity. Incorporating ToF from OTK improves the purity to 25.7%. A full combination of ITK, TPC, and OTK significantly enhances performance, achieving 96.8% efficiency and 87.4% purity (product: 84.6%). Furthermore, a momentum-dependent strategy that dynamically selects the optimal detector combination achieves the best overall performance, with 99.4% efficiency and 92.4% purity, corresponding to a 91.8% kaon identification quality. These results demonstrate that the CEPC baseline detector fulfills the requirements for precision flavor tagging and provide clear guidance for future optimization of timing detector configurations.</description>

      <title>Silicon single-photon detector achieving over 84% photon detection efficiency with flexible operation modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon single-photon detectors (Si SPDs) play a crucial role in detecting single photons in the visible spectrum. For various applications, photon detection efficiency (PDE) is the most critical characteristic for effectively collecting photons. Here, we present a Si SPD with a remarkable PDE of up to 84.4% at 785 nm, supporting multiple operation modes. We design and fabricate a thick-junction Si single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) that enhances the avalanche probability through a backside-illumination structure, while minimizing noise through the design of a doping-compensated avalanche region. To maximize PDE, we implement a readout circuit with a 50 V quenching voltage, enabling operation in free-running, gating, or hybrid modes. The SPAD, along with its readout circuits and affiliated circuits, is integrated into a compact SPD module. In free-running mode, the module achieves a maximum PDE of 84.4%, with a dark count rate of 260 cps, and an afterpulse probability of 2.9% at 268 K. This work provides a practical solution for applications requiring ultra-high-efficiency Si SPD with multiple operation modes.</description>

Abstract: Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is a key performance metric of an imaging instrument. Here we describe characterisation of SNR of a custom 2-photon microscope and compare the SNR performance of our microscope with selected commercial 2-photon microscopes. The methodology described in this paper can serve as guidance for others wishing to characterise and benchmark their 2-photon or other point-scanning microscopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A RadioFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher system has been developed and implemented in a collinear laser spectroscopy setup. This system is dedicated to convert a continuous ion beam into short bunches, while enhancing beam quality and reducing energy spread. The functionality of the RFQ cooler-buncher has been verified through offline tests with stable rubidium and indium beam, delivered from a surface ion source and a laser ablation ion source, respectively. With a transmission efficiency exceeding 60\%, bunched ion beams with a full width at half maximum of approximately 2~$\mu$s in the time-of-flight spectrum have been successfully achieved. The implementation of the RFQ cooler-buncher system also significantly improves the overall transmission efficiency of the collinear laser spectroscopy setup.</description>

      <title>Step-by-step design guide of a cryogenic three-axis vector magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tunable magnetic field at low temperatures is essential for numerous applications, including spintronics, magnetic resonance imaging, and condensed matter physics. While commercial superconducting vector magnets are available, they are complex, expensive, and often not adaptable to specific experimental needs. As a result, simple in-house designs are often being used in research environments. However, no comprehensive step-by-step guide for their construction currently exists. In this work, we provide a detailed manual for designing and building a cryogenically compatible three-axis vector magnet. The system is tested at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator at temperatures ranging from 15 mK to 4 K, with no significant increase in base temperature. Safety measures are implemented to mitigate heating from quenching. The coils are successfully driven with DC currents as high as 3 A, generating magnetic fields of up to 2.5 T in the bobbin's bore and 0.4 T at the sample position. Magnetic field measurements using Hall sensors demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of the designed performance.</description>

      <title>LArTPC hit-based topology classification with quantum machine learning and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12655v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to separate track-like and shower-like topologies in liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiments for neutrino physics using quantum machine learning. Effective reconstruction of neutrino events in LArTPCs requires accurate and granular information about the energy deposited in the detector. These energy deposits can be viewed as 2-D images. Simulated data from the MicroBooNE experiment and a simple custom dataset are used to perform pixel-level classification of the underlying particle topology. Images of the events have been studied by creating small patches around each pixel to characterise its topology based on its immediate neighbourhood. This classification is achieved using convolution-based learning models, including quantum-enhanced architectures known as quanvolutional neural networks. The quanvolutional networks are extended to symmetries beyond translation. Rotational symmetry has been incorporated into a subset of the models. Quantum-enhanced models perform better than their classical counterparts with a comparable number of parameters but are outperformed by classical models, which contain an order of magnitude more parameters. The inclusion of rotation symmetry appears to benefit only large models and remains to be explored further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After an upgrade in 2019--2021, the LHCb experiment is taking data in Run 3 (2022--2026) with an instantaneous luminosity of proton-proton collisions of $2\!\times\!10^{33}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. This article presents the Radiation Monitoring System (RMS-R3) for controlling the beam and background conditions at LHCb. It runs continuously during the detector's operation, and independently of the main LHCb data acquisition. Its design is based on robust and radiation-hard Metal Foil Detector technology. The RMS-R3 monitors the instantaneous luminosity and its evolution. The analysis of the RMS-R3 Run 3 data demonstrates its linear response with a high reproducibility in a five orders of magnitude dynamic range of luminosity over a long period of operation.</description>

      <title>A 55-nm SRAM Chip Scanning Errors Every 125 ns for Event-Wise Soft Error Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a 55 nm CMOS SRAM chip that scans all data every 125 ns and outputs timestamped soft error data via an SPI interface through a FIFO. The proposed system, consisting of the developed chip and particle detectors, enables event-wise soft error measurement and precise identification of SBUs and MCUs, thus resolving misclassifications such as Pseudo- and Distant MCUs that conventional methods cannot distinguish. An 80-MeV proton irradiation experiment at RARiS, Tohoku University verified the system operation. Timestamps between the SRAM chip and the particle detectors were successfully synchronized, accounting for PLL disturbances caused by radiation. Event building was achieved by determining a reset offset with sub-ns resolution, and spatial synchronization was maintained within several tens of micrometers.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics are a major source of decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their atomistic origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, which are predominantly based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and only measure defects within a narrow frequency band and limited mode volume, hindering direct insight into TLS defect behaviour in isolated materials and interfaces. Here, we introduce a broadband 3D waveguide spectroscopy technique that enables cryogenic probing of ensembles of TLS defects that we call Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS). Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands of the ensembles of TLS defects. The broadband and power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it especially well-suited to the study of dressed-state physics in driven ensembles of TLS defects, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. Additionally, BCTDS enables the identification of eigenmode frequencies of the undriven ensembles of TLS defects through characteristic V-shaped features obtained via Fourier analysis of time-domain signals, and shows evidence of memory effects arising from interactions and the broadband nature of our approach. Crucially, our method is modular and can be applied throughout the device fabrication process, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.</description>
