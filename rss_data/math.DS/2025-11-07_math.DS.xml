      <title>The Mean-Field Ott-Antonsen Manifold is an Unstable Manifold in the Continuum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interacting particle systems of Kuramoto-type. Our focus is on the dynamical relation between the partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the continuum limit (CL) and the one obtained in the mean-field limit (MFL). Both equations arise when we are considering the limit of infinitely many interacting particles but the classes of PDEs are structurally different. The CL tracks particles effectively pointwise, while the MFL is an evolution for a typical particle. First, we briefly discuss the relation between solutions of the CL and the MFL showing how to generate solutions of the CL starting from solutions of the MFL. Our main result concerns a dynamical relation between important invariant manifolds of the CFL and the MFL. In particular, we give an explicit proof that the unstable manifold of the homogeneous steady state of the CL is the direct dynamical analogue of the famous Ott-Antonsen manifold for the MFL.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based Hopf-bifurcation Instability Suppression via First Lyapunov Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical systems exhibit limit cycle oscillations induced by Hopf bifurcations. In aerospace engineering, limit cycle oscillations arise from undesirable Hopf bifurcation phenomena such as aeroelastic flutter and transonic buffet. In some cases, the resulting limit cycle oscillations can themselves be unstable, leading to amplitude divergence or hysteretic transitions that threaten structural integrity and performance. Avoiding such phenomena when performing gradient based design optimization requires a constraint that quantifies the stability of the bifurcations and the derivative of that constraint with respect to the design variables. To capture the local stability of bifurcations, we leverage the first Lyapunov coefficient, which predicts whether the resulting limit cycle oscillation is stable or unstable. We develop an accurate and efficient method for computing derivatives of the first Lyapunov coefficient. We leverage the adjoint method and reverse algorithmic differentiation to efficiently compute the derivative of the first Lyapunov coefficient. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed adjoint method in three design optimization problems that suppress unstable bifurcation: an algebraic Hopf bifurcation model, an aeroelastic model of a typical section, and a nonlinear problem based on the complex Ginzburg-Landau partial differential equation. While the current formulation addresses only a single bifurcation mode, the proposed adjoint shows great potential for efficiently handling Hopf bifurcation constraints in large scale nonlinear problems governed by partial differential equations. Its accuracy, versatility and scalability make it a promising tool for aeroelastic and aerodynamic design optimization as well as other engineering problems involving Hopf bifurcation instabilities.</description>

      <title>A simulation that recapitulates the dynamics of PER-directed colloidal assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-assembly of DNA-coated colloids controlled by enzymatic reactions has the potential to enable the formation of materials with hierarchical organization and switchable configurations. However, the problem of designing such self-assembly is complex, and an effective simulation is necessary to assist in searching for appropriate design protocols. Typical computational methodologies such as molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics have limited ability to access the long time scales required for these hierarchical self-assembly processes. Here we adopt a particle-based reaction-diffusion algorithm to model the spatial-temporal evolution of hundreds to thousands of micron-scale DNA-coated colloid self-assembly process over hours. In order to demonstrate the capability of this digital twin, we compared its predicted core-shell assembly process to results from experiments. The model can qualitatively reproduce the core-shell structures observed in experiment by recapitulating the emergence of compositional heterogeneity when delays between distinct assembly times are introduced. These results support the idea that this approach can successfully capture dynamics over long time scales and the appropriate scale of structure formation. We then use the model to explore different protocols for structure evolution, suggesting how this tool can aid in the design of complex self-organization processes.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of actions of automorphisms on the space of one-parameter subgroups of a torus and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a connected Lie group $G$, we study the dynamics of actions of automorphisms of $G$ on certain compact invariant subspaces of closed subgroups of $G$ in terms of distality and expansivity. We show that only the finite order automorphisms of $G$ act distally on Sub$^p_G$, the smallest compact space containing all closed one-parameter subgroups of $G$, when $G$ is any $n$-torus, $n\in\mathbb{N}$. This enables us to relate distality of the $T$-action on Sub$^p_G$ with that of the $T$-action on $G$ and characterise the same in terms of compactness of closed subgroups generate by $T$ in the group Aut$(G)$, in case $G$ is not a vector group. We also extend these results to the action of subgroups of automorphisms. We show that any $n$-torus $G$, $n\geq 2$, more generally, any connected Lie group $G$ whose central torus has dimension at least 2, does not admit any automorphism which acts expansively on Sub$^p_G$. Our results generalise some results on distal actions by Shah and Yadav, and by Chatterjee and Shah, and some results on expansive actions by Prajapati and Shah.</description>

      <title>Koopman Kalman Filter (KKF): An asymptotically optimal nonlinear filtering algorithm with error bounds and its application to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new filtering algorithm based in the Koopman operator, showing that a nonlinear filtering problem can be seen as an equivalent problem where the dynamics is infinite dimensional, but linear. Using Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), we create a finite dimensional approximation of the filtering problem of dimension $N$, in state and error covariance matrix, that accomplishes an error bound of order \(O(N^{-1/2})\) in both where $N$ denotes the number of points used in the Koopman approximation. The algorithm is denominated Koopman Kalman Filter (KKF), and has computational complexity \(O(T\cdot N^3)\) in time, and \(O(T \cdot N^2)\) in space, where \(T\) is the number of iterations of the filtering problem. We test the algorithm in linear and nonlinear dynamics cases, showing and effective error bound with respect to the Kalman filter, that corresponds to the optimal solution in the linear case, and equals the error performance of other methods in the state of the art, but with a much lower execution time. Also, we propose a parameter estimation algorithm based in KKF, comparing it with Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, showing similar performance with lower execution time.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Word Maps on Groups and Polynomial Maps on Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of Fatou and Julia sets in the context of word maps on complex Lie groups and polynomial maps on finite-dimensional associative $\mathbb C$-algebras. For the group-theoretic question, we investigate the dynamics of the power map $x \mapsto x^{M}$ on the Lie group $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb C)$, where $M \geq 2$ is an integer. For the algebra-related question, we study polynomial self-maps of $\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb C)$ induced by monic one-variable polynomials. In both cases, we pin down the explicit description of the Fatou and Julia sets. We also show that there does not exist any wandering Fatou component of the pair $(p,\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb C))$ where $p\in\mathbb C[z]$ is a monic polynomial of degree $\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Invariant sets through resonant normal form for infinite dimensional holomorphic vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study infinite dimensional holomorphic vector fields on sequence spaces, having a fixed point at $0$. Under suitable hypotheses we prove the existence of analytic invariant submanifolds passing through the fixed point. The restricted dynamics is analytically conjugate to the linear one under some Diophantine-like condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce topological dynamical systems with almost countable spectrum. We prove that the Logarithmic Sarnak Conjecture holds for zero-entropy topological dynamical systems whose spectrum is almost countable. This class includes Anzai skew product on $\mathbb{T}^2$ over a rotation of $\mathbb{T}^1$, time-one maps of continuous suspension flows over rotations, systems with finite maximal pattern entropy, and bounded tame systems.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Geometric Model for the Renormalisation of Bi-critical Irrationally Indifferent Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an entirely new toy model for the dynamical system generated by the post-critical set of a special class of "bi-critical" holomorphic maps. These maps have an irrationally indifferent fixed point together with two critical points that "interact" in a non-trivial way. The model depends entirely on the arithmetic features of a special pair of numbers. This study has generated numerous new results, for instance proving that a trichotomy which holds for the uni-critical case will indeed hold here as well. On the other hand, this model exhibits bi-critical maps that are not dynamically conjugate to the uni-critical case, even when topological features are the same.</description>

      <title>On excitation of control-affine systems and its use for data-driven Koopman approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator and extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) as a data-driven technique for its approximation have attracted considerable attention as a key tool for modeling, analysis, and control of complex dynamical systems. However, extensions towards control-affine systems resulting in bilinear surrogate models are prone to demanding data requirements rendering their applicability intricate. In this paper, we propose a framework for data-fitting of control-affine mappings to increase the robustness margin in the associated system identification problem and, thus, to provide more reliable bilinear EDMD schemes. In particular, guidelines for input selection based on subspace angles are deduced such that a desired threshold with respect to the minimal singular value is ensured. Moreover, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality for maximizing the minimal singular value. Further, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach using bilinear EDMD with control for non-holonomic robots.</description>

      <title>Energy transport and chaos in a one-dimensional disordered nonlinear stub lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate energy propagation in a one-dimensional stub lattice in the presence of both disorder and nonlinearity. In the periodic case, the stub lattice hosts two dispersive bands separated by a flat band; however, we show that sufficiently strong disorder fills all intermediate band gaps. By mapping the two-dimensional parameter space of disorder and nonlinearity, we identify three distinct dynamical regimes (weak chaos, strong chaos, and self-trapping) through numerical simulations of initially localized wave packets. When disorder is strong enough to close the frequency gaps, the results closely resemble those obtained in the one-dimensional disordered discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Klein-Gordon lattice model. In particular, subdiffusive spreading is observed in both the weak and strong chaos regimes, with the second moment $m_2$ of the norm distribution scaling as $m_2 \propto t^{0.33}$ and $m_2 \propto t^{0.5}$, respectively. The system's chaotic behavior follows a similar trend, with the finite-time maximum Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda$ decaying as $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.25}$ and $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.3}$. For moderate disorder strengths, i.e., near the point of gap closing, we find that the presence of small frequency gaps does not exert any noticeable influence on the spreading behavior. Our findings extend the characterization of nonlinear disordered lattices in both weak and strong chaos regimes to other network geometries, such as the stub lattice, which serves as a representative flat-band system.</description>

      <title>Towards optimal control of ensembles of discrete-time systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of ensembles of dynamical systems is an intriguing and challenging problem, arising for example in quantum control. We initiate the investigation of optimal control of ensembles of discrete-time systems, focusing on minimising the average finite horizon cost over the ensemble. For very general nonlinear control systems and stage and terminal costs, we establish existence of minimisers under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we provide a $\Gamma$-convergence result which enables consistent approximation of the challenging ensemble optimal control problem, for example, by using empirical probability measures over the ensemble. Our results form a solid foundation for discrete-time optimal control of ensembles, with many interesting avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Vector Traits Shape Disease Persistence: A Predator Prey Approach to Dengue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dengue continues to pose a major global threat, infecting nearly 390 million people annually. Recognizing the pivotal role of vector competence (vc), recent research focuses on mosquito parameters to inform transmission modeling and vector control strategies.This study models interactions between Aedes vectors and dengue pathogens, highlighting vc as a key driver of within vector infection dynamics and endemic persistence. Using a predator prey framework, we show that endemic conditions emerge naturally from the biological interplay between the vectors strategies to pathogen pressure and we prove global stability of such conditions. Our results reveal that under tropical and subtropical environmental pressures, the innate immune system of vectors cannot offset high vc during endemic outbreaks, highlighting a fundamental biological trade off, vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but cannot enhance immune capacity. This constraint defines the limits of their evolutionary response to pathogen driven selection and drives instability in disease transmission dynamics.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics and route to quasiperiodic synchronization in non-isochronous directed Stuart-Landau triads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupled Stuart-Landau equation serves as a fundamental model for exploring synchronization and emergent behavior in complex dynamical systems. However, understanding its dynamics from a comprehensive nonlinear perspective remains challenging due to the multifaceted influence of coupling topology, interaction strength, and oscillator frequency detuning. Despite extensive theoretical investigations over the decades, numerous aspects remain unexplored, particularly those that bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observations-an essential step toward deepening our understanding of real-world dynamical phenomena. This work investigates the complex dynamics of unidirectionally coupled non-isochronous Stuart-Landau oscillators. Calculations of steady-states and their stability analysis further reveal that periodic attractors corresponding to weak forcing or coupling regimes are dynamically unstable, which pushes the system towards quasiperiodic oscillation on the torus attractor. The mapping of parameter values with the kind of attractor of the oscillatory system is presented and classified into periodic, quasiperiodic, partially synchronized, and chaotic regions. The results of this study can be leveraged to design complex yet controllable dynamical architectures.</description>

      <title>On the entropies of subshifts of finite type on countable amenable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.10015v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G,H$ be two countable amenable groups. We introduce the notion of group charts, which gives us a tool to embed an arbitrary $H$-subshift into a $G$-subshift. Using an entropy addition formula derived from this formalism we prove that whenever $H$ is finitely presented and admits a subshift of finite type (SFT) on which $H$ acts freely, then the set of real numbers attained as topological entropies of $H$-SFTs is contained in the set of topological entropies of $G$-SFTs modulo an arbitrarily small additive constant for any finitely generated group $G$ which admits a translation-like action of $H$. In particular, we show that the set of topological entropies of $G$-SFTs on any such group which has decidable word problem and admits a translation-like action of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ coincides with the set of non-negative upper semi-computable real numbers. We use this result to give a complete characterization of the entropies of SFTs in several classes of groups.
  Corrigendum: An error has been found in the proof of Theorem 4.7. We have added a corrigendum appendix which explains the error, discusses possible solutions and details which results from Section 5 still hold (the only result that is no longer proven is Corollary 5.12). We also provide an update on the state of the art concerning the questions asked in Section 6.</description>

      <title>Measure-Theoretic Time-Delay Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Takens' embedding theorem provides a theoretical foundation for reconstructing the full state of a dynamical system from partial observations. However, the classical theorem assumes that the underlying system is deterministic and that observations are noise-free, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we formulate a measure-theoretic generalization that adopts an Eulerian description of the dynamics and recasts the embedding as a pushforward map between spaces of probability measures. Our mathematical results leverage recent advances in optimal transport. Building on the proposed measure-theoretic time-delay embedding theory, we develop a computational procedure that aims to reconstruct the full state of a dynamical system from time-lagged partial observations, engineered with robustness to handle sparse and noisy data. We evaluate our measure-based approach across several numerical examples, ranging from the classic Lorenz-63 system to real-world applications such as NOAA sea surface temperature reconstruction and ERA5 wind field reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Non-singular and probability measure-preserving actions of infinite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two theorems in the ergodic theory of infinite permutation groups. First, generalizing a theorem of Nessonov for the infinite symmetric group, we show that every non-singular action of a non-archimedean, Roelcke precompact, Polish group on a measure space $(\Omega, \mu)$ admits an invariant $\sigma$-finite measure equivalent to $\mu$. Second, we prove the following de Finetti type theorem: if $G \curvearrowright M$ is a primitive permutation group with no algebraicity verifying an additional uniformity assumption, which is automatically satisfied if $G$ is Roelcke precompact, then any $G$-invariant, ergodic probability measure on $Z^M$, where $Z$ is a Polish space, is a product measure.</description>

      <title>Entropy formula of folding type for $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, Ruelle derived explicit formulae for entropy production of smooth dynamical systems. The vanishing or strict positivity of entropy production is determined by the {\it entropy formula of folding type} \[h_{\mu}(f)= F_{\mu}(f)-\displaystyle\int\sum\nolimits_{\lambda_i(x)&lt;0} \lambda_i(x)d\mu(x), \] which relates the metric entropy, folding entropy and negative Lyapunov exponents. This paper establishes the formula for all inverse SRB measures of $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps, including those with degeneracy (i.e., zero Jacobian). More specifically, we establish the equivalence that $\mu$ is an inverse SRB measure if and only if the folding-type entropy formula holds and the Jacobian series is integrable. To overcome the degeneracy, we develop Pesin theory for general $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps.</description>

      <title>Historical behavior of skew products and arcsine laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the occurrence of historical behavior for almost every point in the setting of skew products with one-dimensional fiber dynamics. Under suitable ergodic conditions, we establish that a weak form of the arcsine law leads to the non-convergence of Birkhoff averages along almost every orbit. As an application, we show that this phenomenon occurs for one-step skew product maps over a Bernoulli shift, where the stochastic process induced by the iterates of the fiber maps is conjugate to a random walk.
  Furthermore, we revisit known examples of skew products that exhibit historical behavior almost everywhere, verifying that they fulfill the required ergodic and probabilistic conditions. Consequently, our results provide a unified and generalized framework that connects such behaviors to the arcsine distribution of the orbits.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional Moving Averages and Submanifold Genericity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize results of Jones and Olsen on multi-parameter moving ergodic averages to measure-preserving actions of $\mathbb R^d$ for $d\geq 1$. In particular, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the pointwise convergence of averages over families of boxes in $\mathbb R^d$. As an application of our characterization, we show that averages along dilates of "locally flat" submanifolds in $\mathbb R^d$ do not necessarily converge point-wise for bounded measurable functions. This is closely related to the concept of submanifold-genericity recently introduced in \cite{BFK25}.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein convergence rates in the invariance principle for nonuniformly hyperbolic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain $q$-Wasserstein convergence rates in the invariance principle for nonuniformly hyperbolic flows, where $q\ge1$ depends on the degree of nonuniformity. Utilizing a martingale-coboundary decomposition for nonuniformly expanding semiflows, we extend techniques from the discrete-time setting to the continuous-time case. Our results apply to uniformly hyperbolic (Axiom A) flows, nonuniformly hyperbolic flows that can be modelled by suspensions over Young towers with exponential tails (such as dispersing billiard flows and the classical Lorenz attractor), and intermittent solenoidal flows.</description>

      <title>Human-Wildlife interactions in a tropical forest context: modeling, analysis and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anthropisation and excessive hunting in tropical forests threaten biodiversity, ecosystem maintenance and human food security. In this article, we focus on the issue of coexistence between humans and wildlife in an anthropised environment. Assuming that the human population moves between its residential area and the surrounding forest to hunt, we study a resource-consumer model with consumer migration. A comprehensive analysis of the system is carried out using classical theory and monotone systems theory. We show that the possibilities for long-term coexistence between human populations and wildlife populations are determined by hunting rate thresholds. Depending on the level of anthropisation and the hunting rate, the system may converge towards a limit cycle or a co-existence equilibrium. However, the conditions for coexistence become more difficult as anthropisation increases. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a new method to blend fractal attractors using the code map for the IFS formed by the Hutchinson--Barnsley operators of a finite family of hyperbolic IFSs. We introduce a parameter called blending coefficient to measure the similarity between the blended set and each one of the original attractors. We also introduce a discrete approximation algorithm and prove a rigorous error estimation used to approximate these new objects. Several simulation results are provided illustrating our techniques.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Energy-Critical Wave Equation to a Finite Dimensional Attractor via Nonlinear Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18042v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wave equation with energy critical sources and nonlinear damping defined on a 3D bounded domain is considered. It is shown that the resulting dynamical system admits a global attractor. Under the additional assumption of strong monotonicity of the damping at the origin, it is shown that the originally unstable quintic wave is uniformly stabilised to a finite dimensional and smooth set. Moreover, the existence of exponential attractor is established. In order to handle \enquote{energy criticality} of both sources and damping, the methods used depend on enhanced dissipation \cite{Bociu-lasiecka-jde}, energy {\it identity} for weak solutions \cite{Koch-lasiecka}, an adaptation of Ball's method \cite{ball}, and the theory of quasi-stable systems \cite{chueshov-white}.</description>

As applications, we prove the arithmetic version of localization, the finite volume version of $(\frac12-)$-H\"older continuity of the IDS, and the absence of eigenvalues (for Aubry dual operators).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the diameter of the image of the skinning map on the deformation space of an acylindrical reflection group is bounded by a constant depending only on the topological complexity of the components of its boundary, answering a conjecture of Minsky in the reflection group setting. This result can be interpreted as a uniform rigidity theorem for disk patterns. Our method also establishes a connection between the diameter of the skinning image and certain discrete extremal width on the Coxeter graph of the reflection group.</description>

      <title>Improved error bounds for Koopman operator and reconstructed trajectories approximations with kernel-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new error bound for Koopman operator approximation using Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition. The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</description>
