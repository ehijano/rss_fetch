      <title>Unified Micromechanics Theory of Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the matrix composite materials (CM) of either random (statistically homogeneous or inhomogeneous), periodic, or deterministic (neither random nor periodic) structures. CMs exhibit linear or nonlinear behavior, coupled or uncoupled multi-physical phenomena, locally elastic, weakly nonlocal (strain gradient and stress gradient), or strongly nonlocal (strain-type and displacement-type, peridynamics) phase properties. A modified Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) approach introduces an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE) for CMs of any structure and phase properties mentioned above. The unified iteration solution of static AGIEs is adapted to the body force with compact support serving as a fundamentally new universal training parameter. The approach also establishes a critical threshold for filtering out unsuitable sub-datasets of effective parameters through a novel Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill's classical framework. This RVE concept eliminates sample size, boundary layer, and edge effects, making it applicable to CMs of any structure and phase properties, regardless of local or nonlocal, linear or nonlinear. Incorporating this new RVE concept into machine learning and neural network techniques enables the construction of any unpredefined surrogate nonlocal operators. The methodology is structured as a modular, block-based framework, allowing independent development and refinement of software components. This flexible, robust AGIE-CAM framework integrates data-driven, multi-scale, and multi-physics modeling, accelerating research in CM of any microtopology and phase properties considered. The AGIE-CAM framework represents a groundbreaking paradigm shift in the micromechanics of composites, redefining the very philosophy that underpins our understanding of their behavior at the microscopic level.</description>

      <title>From deformation theory to a generalized Westervelt equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Westervelt equation describes the propagation of pressure waves in continuous nonlinear and, eventually, diffusive media. The classical framework of this equation corresponds to fluid dynamics theory. This work seeks to connect this equation with the theory of deformations, considering the propagation of mechanical waves in nonlinear and loss-energy media. A deep understanding of pressure wave propagation beyond fluid dynamics it is required to be applied to medical diagnosis and therapeutic treatment. A deduction of a nonlinear partial differential equation for pressure waves is performed from first principles of deformation theory. The nonlinear propagation of pressure waves in tissue produces high-frequency components that are absorbed differently by the tissue, thus, distinguishing each of these modes is essential. An extension of the Westervelt equation beyond fluids media is required. In order to include the behaviour of any order harmonics, a generalization of this equation is also developed.</description>

      <title>Local bifurcation analysis of circular von-K\'arm\'an plate with Kirchhoff rod boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry based reduction is applied to the buckling of a circular von-Karman plate with Kirchhoff rod boundary, where a mismatch between the edge length and the perimeter of plate is treated as the bifurcation parameter. A nonlinear operator formulation describes the equilibrium of the elastic rod plate system. The critical points, as potential bifurcation points, are stated using the linearized operator. The symmetry of null space for each critical point is identified as a subgroup of the complete symmetry group of nonlinear problem, the equivariance associated with the nonlinear operator is used in this process. Sufficient evidence is provided for each critical point to be a bifurcation point for the symmetry reduced problem and post buckling analysis is carried out using Lyapunov Schmidt reduction. Bifurcation curves are obtained till quadratic order in bifurcation parameter away from each critical value. Theoretical results for bifurcation curves are validated against the numerical simulation based on a symmetry reduced finite element method for some illustrative examples of critical points. A numerical study is carried out for the dependence of the coefficient of quadratic term in the bifurcation parameter when structural parameters are varied in a neighborhood of four fixed sets of structural parameters. Numerical results based on a symmetry reduced finite element analysis confirm that the nonlinear solution agrees with the local theoretical behavior close to a critical point but deviates further away from it. Using these tools, two main conclusions are reached. First it is observed that the critical points of the linearized problem are indeed bifurcation points. Second, an alteration in the nature of bifurcation is observed during the parameter sweep study when the plate is in tension.</description>
