      <title>Modeling Indoor PM$_{2.5}$ Exposure During Retrofits: Plastic Film Barriers and a Quadratic Baseline Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporary plastic film barriers are widely used to separate occupied rooms from exterior renovation zones, yet their effect on indoor particulate exposure is poorly quantified. We monitored PM$_{2.5}$ in a Tampa, Florida, apartment for 48 days with a low-cost optical sensor (Temtop LKC-1000S+), spanning pre-barrier, barrier-on, and post-barrier periods. A quadratic baseline was fitted to "background" minutes devoid of identifiable indoor sources, allowing excess concentrations ($\Delta$PM) to be partitioned into facade work, cooking, and passive accumulation without outdoor co-monitoring. The barrier prevented large construction spikes indoors but curtailed natural ventilation, doubling the mean baseline from 1.9 to 3.9 $\mu$g m$^{-3}$. During this stage, passive build-up accounted for $45\,\%$ of the daily excess dose, with facade work and cooking contributing $31\,\%$ and $24\,\%$, respectively. Once the new window was installed and evening airing resumed, the baseline fell to 0.8 $\mu$g m$^{-3}$, the lowest of the campaign. Our findings highlight the trade-off between dust shielding and background elevation and demonstrate that simple polynomial fitting bolsters low-cost IAQ diagnostics in mechanically unventilated dwellings. The framework is readily transferable to other retrofits; future studies should pair indoor sensing with outdoor references and multi-room deployments to refine infiltration estimates.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the effectiveness of concrete and metal shields in photoneutron reduction: A Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Neutrons are produced when photons interact with parts of the accelerator, materials in the treatment room, or the patient's body. These neutrons have significant biological effects due to their high quality factor, potentially leading to secondary cancers. Material and method: A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted using the MCNPX code to model an Elekta Infinity linear accelerator operating at 18 MV. The accelerator was situated inside a bunker measuring 7.4* 5 m2. To study photoneutron production and the effectiveness of shielding, various concrete mixtures were applied to the walls of the maze and treatment room. Results: Regardless of the modifications, both photon and neutron fluence decreased substantially as the distance from the maze entrance increased. The fluence reduction was more pronounced between the maze entrance and center. The lowest equivalent neutron doses behind the treatment room door were observed when Ord-Lim concrete was used, while the highest doses occurred with Gal-Bar concrete. Conclusion: The configuration of concrete layers within the treatment room and maze walls is a key factor influencing the changes in neutron dose behind the treatment room door. These variations result from differences in concrete composition and the way neutrons are absorbed in different setups.</description>

      <title>Predictive Digital Twins with Quantified Uncertainty for Patient-Specific Decision Making in Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty in predictive models is critical for establishing trust and enabling risk-informed decision making for personalized medicine. In contrast to one-size-fits-all approaches that seek to mitigate risk at the population level, digital twins enable personalized modeling thereby potentially improving individual patient outcomes. Realizing digital twins in biomedicine requires scalable and efficient methods to integrate patient data with mechanistic models of disease progression. This study develops an end-to-end data-to-decisions methodology that combines longitudinal non-invasive imaging data with mechanistic models to estimate and predict spatiotemporal tumor progression accounting for patient-specific anatomy. Through the solution of a statistical inverse problem, imaging data inform the spatially varying parameters of a reaction-diffusion model of tumor progression. An efficient parallel implementation of the forward model coupled with a scalable approximation of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables rigorous, but tractable, quantification of uncertainty due to the sparse, noisy measurements. The methodology is verified on a virtual patient with synthetic data to control for model inadequacy, noise level, and the frequency of data collection. The application to decision-making is illustrated by evaluating the importance of imaging frequency and formulating an optimal experimental design question. The clinical relevance is demonstrated through a model validation study on a cohort of patients with publicly available longitudinal imaging data.</description>

      <title>Probing arbitrary polarized photon pairs undergoing double Compton scatterings by a dedicated MC simulator validated with experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in the degree of polarization of freedom of the two-photon system have been extensively studied and form our current understanding of the quantum nature of our world. Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons. This puts us in a position to derive the behavior of the experimental observable, the angular difference $\Delta\hat\Phi$ formed by the two scattering planes. We validate our Vienna-Warsaw simulator with the high-statistics experimental sample --based on a total of $3 \times 10^5 $ event candidates -- of two-photon pairs measured with the J-PET Big Barrel detector. We deduce the value of the squared visibility (interference contrast) encoding the polarization in the angle difference of the two scattering planes, $\Delta\hat\Phi$. The simulated spectra are in good agreement with the experimental correlation spectra and behave as predicted by theory.</description>

      <title>Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radioablation for Refractory Ventricular Tachycardia: A Narrative Review and Exploratory Pooled Analysis of Clinical Outcomes and Toxicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation (STAR) is a non-invasive salvage therapy for refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially in patients ineligible for catheter ablation. This narrative review and pooled analysis evaluates the safety, efficacy, and technical characteristics of STAR, integrating preclinical studies, case reports, case series, and clinical trials. Methods and Materials: A comprehensive review identified 86 studies published between 2015 and 2025, including 12 preclinical studies, 49 case reports, 18 case series, and 7 clinical trials. Study-level data were extracted for pooled analysis of 6- and 12-month mortality, VT burden reduction, and grade 3+ acute toxicities. Subgroup analyses were performed by delivery modality, age, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and cardiomyopathy type. Results: Pooled mortality was 16% (95% CI: 11-20%) at 6 months and 33% (95% CI: 27-38%) at 12 months. VT burden reduction at 6 months averaged 75% (95% CI: 73-77%) but showed substantial heterogeneity (I^2 = 98.8%). Grade 3+ acute toxicities occurred in 7% (95% CI: 4-10%), with heart failure being most common. Subgroup analyses suggested better outcomes in younger patients, those with NICM, and those with higher LVEF. Conclusions: STAR is a promising salvage therapy with favorable acute safety and efficacy. Outcome heterogeneity and inconsistent reporting highlight the need for standardized definitions, dosimetric protocols, and longer-term follow-up. Prospective trials and real-world registries are critical for refining STAR's role in VT management.</description>

      <title>On Overlap Ratio in Defocused Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D STEM) with data acquired using a defocused electron probe is a promising tool for characterising complex biological specimens and materials through a phase retrieval process known as Electron Ptychography (EP). The efficacy of 4D STEM acquisition and the resulting quality of EP reconstruction depends on the overlap ratio of adjacent illuminated areas. This paper demonstrates how the overlap ratio impacts the data redundancy and the quality of the EP reconstruction. We define two quantities as a function of the overlap ratio that are independent of both the object and the EP algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluate an EP algorithm for varying overlap ratios using simulated 4D STEM datasets. Notably, a 40% or greater overlap ratio yields stable, high-quality reconstructions.</description>
