      <title>On the numerical simulations of electric field-enhanced solid-state electro-aerodynamic thrusters enabled with an insulated electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solid-state electro-aerodynamic propulsion system applies a high electric potential difference between two electrodes to ionize air within the resulting electric field, accelerating the ions to generate thrust. Previously, the so-called ``decoupled thrusters'' have been proposed, in which ion generation and acceleration are spatially decoupled. Here, we argue that such decoupling is infeasible from the perspective of electric field lines if the diffusion effects are ignored, and consequently the driving method (e.g., dielectric barrier discharge) for the additional electrodes can be improved. Specifically, the use of auxiliary electrodes that do not discharge but induce ionization and attachment can be appropriate. This concept was named the electric field-enhanced solid-state electro-aerodynamic propulsion system. Furthermore, through numerical simulations, this concept showed improvement in thrust density while maintaining the thrust-to-power ratio.</description>

      <title>Transition of blue-core helicon discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the transitional characteristics of blue-core helicon discharge, which to our knowledge was not particularly focused on before. Parameters are measured on recently built advanced linear plasma device, i.e. Multiple Plasma Simulation Linear Device (MPS-LD) by various diagnostics including Langmuir probe, optical emission spectrometer, and standard high-speed camera. It is found that the jump direction of electron density (from low level to high level) is opposite to that of electron temperature (from high level to low level). Electron density increases significantly and the radial profile becomes localized near the axis when the blue-core transition occurs. With increased field strength, electron density increases whereas electron temperature drops. The radial profile of electron temperature looks like a ``W" shape, i.e. minimizing around the edge of blue-core column. Electron density increases with background pressure, while electron temperature peaks around certain pressure value. High-speed videos show that the plasma column oscillates radially and experiences azimuthal instabilities with high rate once entered blue-core mode. An electromagnetic solver (EMS) based on Maxwell's equations and a cold-plasma dielectric tensor is also employed to compute the wave field and power absorption during blue-core transition, to provide more details that are valuable for understanding the transitional physics but not yet available in experiment. The results show that wave field in both radial and axial directions changes significantly during the transition, its structure differs from antenna to downstream, and the power dependence of wave magnetic field is overall opposite to that of wave electric field. This work presents comprehensive characteristics of the transitional blue-core discharge and is important to both physics understanding and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics of nondegenerate hydrogen plasma using improved Kelbg pseudopotential with electron finite-size correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to semiclassical molecular dynamics simulation of nondegenerate hydrogen plasma using an improved Kelbg pseudopotential. The main novelty of our method is accounting for the finite size of electrons. This modification resolves the nonphysical cluster formation at temperatures below 50 kK, which was first reported by A.V. Filinov [Phys. Rev. E 70, 046411 (2004)]. However, the energy still appears to be underestimated at low temperatures, as indicated by comparisons with the recent path integral Monte Carlo calculations [Phys. Plasmas 31, 110501 (2024)]. Using the presented method, we analyze the dependence of radial distribution functions, composition, ionization degree, energy, and pressure on the plasma coupling parameter, while maintaining a fixed degeneracy parameter. Additionally, we demonstrate the impact of incorporating long-range interactions on the energy $N$-dependence by utilizing the angular-averaged Ewald potential. Finally, we compute the thermodynamic limits for energy and pressure.</description>

      <title>Design and initial results from the "Junior" Levitated Dipole Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OpenStar Technologies is a private fusion company exploring the levitated dipole concept for commercial fusion energy production. OpenStar has manufactured a new generation of levitated dipole experiment, called "Junior", leveraging recent advances made in high-temperature superconducting magnet technologies. Junior houses a ~5.6 T REBCO high-temperature superconducting magnet in a 5.2 m vacuum chamber, with plasma heating achieved via &lt; 50 kW of electron cyclotron resonance heating power. Importantly, this experiment integrates novel high temperature superconductor power supply technology on board the dipole magnet. Recently OpenStar has completed first experimental campaigns with the Junior experiment, achieving first plasmas in late 2024. Experiments conducted with the full levitated system are planned for 2025. This article provides an overview of the main results from these experiments and details improvements planned for future campaigns.</description>

      <title>Effective resistivity in relativistic collisionless plasmoid-mediated reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection can power spectacular high-energy astrophysical phenomena by producing non-thermal energy distributions in highly magnetized regions around compact objects. By means of two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations we investigate relativistic collisionless plasmoid-mediated reconnection in magnetically dominated pair plasmas with and without guide field. In X-points, where diverging flows result in a non-diagonal thermal pressure tensor, a finite residence time for particles gives rise to a localized collisionless effective resistivity. Here, for the first time for relativistic reconnection in a fully developed plasmoid chain we identify the mechanisms driving the non-ideal electric field using a full Ohm's law by means of a statistical analysis based on our PIC simulations. We show that the non-ideal electric field is predominantly driven by gradients of nongyrotropic thermal pressures. We propose a kinetic physics motivated non-uniform effective resistivity model, which is negligible on global scales and becomes significant only locally in X-points, that captures the properties of collisionless reconnection with the aim of mimicking its essentials in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic descriptions. This effective resistivity model provides a viable opportunity to design physically grounded global models for reconnection-powered high-energy emission.</description>
