      <title>Adaptive time-stepping for the Super-Droplet Method Monte Carlo collision-coalescence scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of an adaptive time-stepping scheme for the Super-Droplet Method (SDM), a Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating particle coagulation. SDM represents cloud droplets as weighted superdroplets, enabling high-fidelity representations of microphysical processes such as collision-coalescence. However, the algorithm can undercount collisions when the expected number of events is not realizable given the superdroplet configuration, introducing a biased error referred here as the collision deficit. While SDM exhibits statistical spread inherent to Monte Carlo schemes, the deficit is a systematic underestimation of collision events. This error can be addressed with adaptive time-stepping, which dynamically adjusts simulation time steps to eliminate this deficit. We analyze the behavior of the deficit across a wide range of timesteps, superdroplet counts, and initialization strategies, and explore trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Using the classical Safranov-Golovin test case, we show that the deficit increases with timestep and superdroplet count, and that adaptive time-stepping effectively removes the associated error without significant cost. We test a smooth continuum of initial distributions with extrema representing two different initialization methods, and find that while the deficit is sensitive to the choice of attribute-space sampling strategies, adaptive time-stepping substantially reduces the difference, allowing for users to choose initialization methods optimized for other processes. We also propose a method of visualization, capturing both the attribute sampling, droplet interactions over multiple timesteps, and the deficit using network connectivity graphs. In 2-D flow-coupled simulations, we find the deficit can have a stronger effect on convergence than previously shown, with uncorrected deficit delaying the onset of precipitation.</description>

      <title>Tidally Induced Turbulence in the Abyssal Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the upwelling branch of the abyssal overturning circulation is characterized by strong flows driven by turbulence along sloping topography. The Boundary Layer Turbulence field campaign has provided direct evidence for strong upslope flows along a deep submarine canyon of the Rockall Trough. Turbulent overturning events spanning 200 m in the vertical were observed every tidal cycle, suggesting that the strong tidal flows in the canyon periodically undergo some form of instability. However, it is shown that the flow never satisfied the classical instability condition for time-independent sheared flows in a stratified fluid commonly used in oceanographic studies to determine transition to turbulence. This study illustrates that the time dependence of the tidal flow changes the stability properties and explains the observed transition to a turbulent state. The findings suggest that turbulent mixing induced by oscillatory shear flow may be ubiquitous over sloping topography and play an important role in deep ocean mixing that supports the global overturning circulation.</description>

      <title>Distillation of CNN Ensemble Results for Enhanced Long-Term Prediction of the ENSO Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate long-term forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is still one of the biggest challenges in climate science. While it is true that short-to medium-range performance has been improved significantly using the advances in deep learning, statistical dynamical hybrids, most operational systems still use the simple mean of all ensemble members, implicitly assuming equal skill across members. In this study, we demonstrate, through a strictly a-posteriori evaluation , for any large enough ensemble of ENSO forecasts, there is a subset of members whose skill is substantially higher than that of the ensemble mean. Using a state-of-the-art ENSO forecast system cross-validated against the 1986-2017 observed Nino3.4 index, we identify two Top-5 subsets one ranked on lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and another on highest Pearson correlation. Generally across all leads, these outstanding members show higher correlation and lower RMSE, with the advantage rising enormously with lead time. Whereas at short leads (1 month) raises the mean correlation by about +0.02 (+1.7%) and lowers the RMSE by around 0.14 {\deg}C or by 23.3% compared to the All-40 mean, at extreme leads (23 months) the correlation is raised by +0.43 (+172%) and RMSE by 0.18 {\deg}C or by 22.5% decrease. The enhancements are largest during crucial ENSO transition periods such as SON and DJF, when accurate amplitude and phase forecasting is of greatest socio-economic benefit, and furthermore season-dependent e.g., mid-year months such as JJA and MJJ have incredibly large RMSE reductions. This study provides a solid foundation for further investigations to identify reliable clues for detecting high-quality ensemble members, thereby enhancing forecasting skill.</description>

      <title>Seasonal forecasting using the GenCast probabilistic machine learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learnt weather prediction (MLWP) models are now well established as being competitive with conventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in the medium range. However, there is still much uncertainty as to how this performance extends to longer timescales, where interactions with slower components of the earth system become important. We take GenCast, a state-of-the-art probabilistic MLWP model, and apply it to the task of seasonal forecasting with prescribed sea surface temperature (SST), by providing anomalies persisted over climatology (GenCast-Persisted) or forcing with observations (GenCast-Forced). The forecasts are compared to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts seasonal forecasting system, SEAS5. Our results indicate that, despite being trained at short timescales, GenCast-Persisted produces much of the correct precipitation patterns in response to El Ni\~{n}o and La Ni\~{n}a events, with several erroneous patterns in GenCast-Persisted corrected with GenCast-Forced. The uncertainty in precipitation response, as represented by the ensemble, compares favourably to SEAS5. Whilst SEAS5 achieves superior skill in the tropics for 2-metre temperature and mean sea level pressure (MSLP), GenCast-Persisted achieves significantly higher skill in some areas in higher latitudes, including mountainous areas, with notable improvements for MSLP in particular; this is reflected in a higher correlation with the observed NAO index. Reliability diagrams indicate that GenCast-Persisted is overconfident compared to SEAS5, whilst GenCast-Forced produces well-calibrated seasonal 2-metre temperature predictions. These results provide an indication of the potential of MLWP models similar to GenCast for the `full' seasonal forecasting problem, where the atmospheric model is coupled to ocean, land and cryosphere models.</description>
