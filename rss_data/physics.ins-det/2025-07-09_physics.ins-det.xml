      <title>Online Electron Reconstruction at CLAS12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online reconstruction is key for monitoring purposes and real time analysis in High Energy and Nuclear Physics experiments. A necessary component of reconstruction algorithms is particle identification that combines information left by a particle passing through several detector components to identify the particle's type. Of particular interest to electroproduction Nuclear Physics experiments such as CLAS12 is electron identification which is used to trigger data recording. A machine learning approach was developed for CLAS12 to reconstruct and identify electrons by combining raw signals at the data acquisition level from several detector components. This approach achieves an electron identification purity above 75% whilst retaining an efficiency close to 100%. The machine learning tools are capable of running at high rates exceeding the data acquisition rates and will allow electron reconstruction in real time. This work enhances online analyses and monitoring and can contribute to improved triggering at CLAS12. This machine learning driven approach will also be crucial for experiments aiming to transition to streaming readout operations where online reconstruction will be a key component of the data taking paradigm.</description>

      <title>Neutron EDM Experiment with an Advanced Ultracold Neutron Source at TRIUMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TRIUMF Ultracold Advanced Neutron (TUCAN) collaboration has been developing a high-intensity ultracold neutron (UCN) source aimed at searching for the neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) with a sensitivity goal of $10^{-27}\ e{\rm cm}$. This article reports on recent progress in commissioning of the UCN source and in the development of the neutron EDM spectrometer. In its final configuration, the accelerator-driven super-thermal UCN source will enable a neutron EDM experiment with two orders of magnitude improved statistics compared to the current best experiment. Substantial progress in 2024 allowed the collaboration to operate the complete source system, with the exception of the liquid deuterium cold moderator, resulting in the first production of UCNs. The status of the EDM spectrometer is also presented, with emphasis on UCN handling components and magnetic subsystems relevant to field control, shielding, and magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Quantitative U/Th deposition and cleanliness control strategies in the JUNO site air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jiangmen underground neutrino observatory (JUNO) is made of a 20 kt liquid scintillator (LS) detector at a depth of 700 m underground. In order to meet all physics requirements, the $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th content in the LS is required to reach a level of 10$^{-17}$ g/g. However, the radioactivity of dust in the air is about 12 orders of magnitude higher than that, so there is an extremely high requirement for the cleanliness of the installation environment on site. In this study, a clean room management mode was implemented in the 120,000 m$^3$ space of the JUNO underground experimental main hall, to control the environmental cleanliness at a level equivalent to a class 10,000-100,000 clean room. Additionally, we designed a method to directly measure the deposition rate of $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th on the surface of the detector. Based on ICP-MS detection, the sensitivity to $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th concentrations can reach the level of picograms (pg). This helps to implement the cleanliness control strategies and to assess the level of external contamination during the construction of the detector.</description>

      <title>The CMS Phase-2 Fast Beam Condition Monitor prototype test with beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fast Beam Condition Monitor (FBCM) is a standalone luminometer for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) program of the CMS Experiment at CERN. The detector is under development and features a new, radiation-hard, front-end application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for beam monitoring applications. The achieved timing resolution of a few nanoseconds enables the measurement of both the luminosity and the beam-induced background. The ASIC, called FBCM23, features six channels with adjustable shaping times, enabling in-field fine-tuning. Each ASIC channel outputs a single binary asynchronous signal encoding time of arrival and time over threshold information. The FBCM is based on silicon-pad sensors, with two sensor designs presently being considered. This paper presents the results of tests of the FBCM detector prototype using both types of silicon sensors with hadron, muon, and electron beams. Irradiated FBCM23 ASICs and silicon-pad sensors were also tested to simulate the expected conditions near the end of the detector's lifetime in the HL-LHC radiation environment. Based on test results, direct bonding between the sensor and ASIC was chosen, and an optimal bias voltage and ASIC threshold for FBCM operation were proposed. The current design of the front-end test board was validated following the beam test and is now being used for the first front-end module, which is expected to be produced in summer 2025. These results represent a major step forward in validating the FBCM concept, first version of the firmware and establishing a reliable design path for the final detector.</description>

      <title>Fast nanothermometry based on direct electron detection of electron backscattering diffraction patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate temperature measurement at the nanoscale is crucial for thermal management in next-generation microelectronic devices. Existing optical and scanning-probe thermometry techniques face limitations in spatial resolution, accuracy, or invasiveness. In this work, we demonstrate a fast and non-contact nanothermometry method based on temperature-induced changes in electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) patterns captured by a high-performance direct electron detector within a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Using dynamical electron simulations, we establish the theoretical temperature sensitivity limits for several semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs, and GaN), showing that thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) leads to a measurable smearing of Kikuchi bands in the EBSD patterns. We develop a Fourier analysis method that captures these subtle changes across the full diffraction pattern, achieving a simulated temperature sensitivity of approximately 0.15\% per K. Experimental results on silicon confirm a sensitivity of 0.14\% per K and achieve a 13-K temperature uncertainty with a 10-second acquisition time, and enable spatial temperature mapping under thermal gradients. Our approach offers a pathway toward practical and high-resolution thermal mapping directly in SEMs, expanding the toolbox for device-level thermal diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Development, Characterization, and Testing of a Bias Supply for SiPMs in the CMVD Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To assess the viability of a shallow-depth neutrino detector, a Cosmic Muon Veto Detector (CMVD) is being constructed on top of the stack of Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors at TIFR, Mumbai. The CMVD employs extruded plastic scintillators for muon detection, with wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for signal readout. A highly stable, low-noise power source is essential for biasing the SiPMs, as the precision, accuracy, and stability of the supply directly impact the consistency of their gain. To address this, we designed a biasing power supply capable of delivering 50-58 V in 50 mV steps, with a maximum short-circuit current output of 1 mA. The system incorporates digital voltage control, stabilization, and current monitoring, making it compatible with external controllers (such as microcontrollers). This added flexibility and modularity allow for additional functionalities, including temperature compensation. Designed to supply multiple SiPMs with close to breakdown voltages in parallel, the circuit seamlessly integrates with the front-end electronics of the detector system.</description>

      <title>Upscaling the hyperpolarization sample volume of an automated hydrogenative parahydrogen-induced polarizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suffer from inherently low sensitivity due to the weak thermal polarization of nuclear spins. Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) offers a powerful route to enhance NMR signals by several orders of magnitude, enabling real-time metabolic imaging. However, PHIP implementations are often constrained by small sample volumes, limited automation, and complex high-pressure requirements. In this work, we present an upgraded, automated PHIP system capable of hyperpolarizing sample volumes of up to 2.2 mL, making it suitable for preclinical MRI applications. We developed several high-pressure reactors and multi-port NMR tube caps compatible with standard commercial 5, 10, and 16 mm glass tubes. Reactor designs were simulated and fabricated from chemically resistant polymers, ensuring mechanical safety at more than 30 bar. Using FLASH MRI, nutation, and CPMG sequences, we characterized magnetic field homogeneity and stability, establishing optimal sample dimensions (12.5/16 mm ID/OD glass tube, 20 mm height) with B0 inhomogeneity below 2.5 ppm and B1 inhomogeneity around 1%. A high level of injection reproducibility was confirmed (volume precision ~0.6%). Optimization of experimental parameters, including hydrogenation pressure, pH2 flow rate, and sample temperature, enabled rapid and efficient polarization transfer. At optimized conditions (20 bar pH2, 2 L/min flow, 55{\deg}C, 4 s bubbling time), up to 31.3% 1H polarization of two protons was achieved for deuterated ethyl acetate in acetone with the theoretical maximum of 50%. This level of polarization was achieved with a duty cycle of 80 s, and the standard deviation of the mean was below 6.8%.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic energy calibration of the SoLid detector with horizontal muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SoLid is a neutrino experiment at very-short baseline searching for active-to-sterile oscillations of reactor antineutrinos. The detection principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators: polyvinyl toluene and $^6$Li:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup allows the detector to be highly segmented; the basic detection unit is a 5 cm cube. High segmentation provides numerous advantages including precise localisation of the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of an antineutrino energy estimator based on the isolated positron energy, and a powerful background reduction tool that relies on the topological signature of the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of WLS fibres coupled to photosensors. A relative electromagnetic calibration is performed with horizontal cosmic muons. This source poses the simplest calibration problem in which a single detection unit is involved. In addition, large muon energy deposits allow us to perform a calibration at the most detailed level (i.e. per fibre) and to accurately define the fraction of energy escaping to neighbouring detection cells. A statistical precision at the sub-percent level is reached. The paper also discusses two methods to calibrate the absolute energy scale. The first method relies on horizontal muons, though the precision is limited to around 10\% because of the uncertainty in the energy distribution of such muons. A novel, alternative method based on the radioactive AmBe source is proposed. It takes advantage of the electron-positron pair-production process and provides a calibration point at 3.4 MeV (i.e. in the core of the IBD positron spectrum). The paper is concluded with various cross-check including a determination of the energy spectrum of the standard cosmogenic background candle: $^{12}$B.</description>
