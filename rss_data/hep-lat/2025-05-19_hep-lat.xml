      <title>Quark Propagator at one-loop in the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Refined Gribov-Zwanziger scenario is a local and renormalizable setup in which infinitesimal Gribov copies are eliminated and further non-perturbative effects are accounted for. The gluon propagator that arises from this framework fits lattice data very well in the Landau gauge. We investigate the coupling of quarks to this setting at one-loop order by computing the quark propagator. The fermionic sector is introduced by a minimal coupling and the non-perturbative effects are transmitted to the matter sector through gluonic loops which, in this case, carry information from the elimination of infinitesimal Gribov copies and the formation of condensates. We compare our findings with available lattice data both for the unquenched gluon propagator as well as for the quark propagator in the Landau gauge. Our results are comparable with those obtained in the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order. In particular, we are able to fit the unquenched gluon propagator and use the fixed parameters to predict the quark mass function and find good agreement with lattice data. However, the quark dressing function does not agree, even at a qualitative level, with lattice data in the infrared. This is agreement with the analogue computation in Curci-Ferrari model. Inspired by the developments in the Curci-Ferrari results, such a disagreement is likely to be cured by the inclusion of two-loops corrections. Finally, we compare the present minimal coupling with a non-perturbative matter coupling proposed in the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger literature.</description>

      <title>Investigating the axial structure of the nucleon based on large-volume lattice QCD at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a short summary for the calculations of the nucleon $\textit{isovector}$ form factors, which are relevant to improving the accuracy of the current neutrino oscillation experiments. The calculations are carried out with two of three sets of the $2+1$ flavor lattice QCD configurations generated at the physical point in large spatial volumes by the PACS Collaboration. The two gauge configurations are generated with the six stout-smeared $O(a)$ improved Wilson quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at the lattice spacing of $0.09$ fm and $0.06$ fm. We summarize the results for three form factors as well as the nucleon axial-vector ($g_A$), induced pseudoscalar ($g_P^*$) and pion-nucleon ($g_{\pi NN}$) couplings. Although our couplings agree with the experimental data, a firm conclusion should be drawn only after a continuum limit extrapolation is taken. We investigate the partially conserved axial-vector current (PCAC) relation in the context of the nucleon correlation functions. The low-energy relations arising from the PCAC relation can be used to verify whether the lattice QCD data correctly reproduce the physics in the continuum within the statistical accuracy. It is demonstrated that our $\textit{new analysis}$ reduces the systematic uncertainty for the induced pseudoscalar and pseudoscalar form factors to a greater extent than the $\textit{traditional analysis}$, and the results offer a theoretical insight into the pion-pole dominance model. Finally, we examine the applicable $q^2$ region for the low-energy relations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Tensor Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in lattice QCD was traditionally done by calculating matrix elements in the symmetric frame. Recent advancements have significantly reduced computational costs by calculating these matrix elements in the asymmetric frame, allowing us to choose the momentum transfer to be in either the initial or final states only. The theoretical methodology requires a new parametrization of the matrix element to obtain Lorentz-invariant amplitudes, which are then related to the GPDs. The formulation and implementation of this approach have already been established for the unpolarized and helicity GPDs. Building upon this idea, we extend this formulation to the four leading-twist quark transversity GPDs ($H_T$, $E_T$, $\widetilde{H}_T$, $\widetilde{E}_T$). We also present numerical results for zero skewness using an $N_f=2+1+1$ ensemble of twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The light quark masses employed in these calculations correspond to a pion mass of about 260 MeV. Furthermore, we include a comparison between the symmetric and asymmetric frame calculations to demonstrate frame independence of the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes. Analysis of the matrix elements in the asymmetric frame is performed at several values of the momentum transfer squared, $-t$, ranging from 0.17 GeV$^2$ to 2.29 GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Thermal Static Potential and Pseudo-Scalar Quarkonium Spectral Functions from 2+1 Flavor Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quarkonia, which are bound states of a heavy quark and antiquark, play a key role in probing the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The dynamics of quarkonia in the QGP are encoded in their finite-temperature spectral functions. In this work, we estimate the quarkonium spectral functions in the pseudo-scalar channel using 2+1 flavor lattice QCD with a pion mass of $320\,\text{MeV}$, at temperatures of $220\,\text{MeV}\,(1.2\,T_{pc}),\,251\,\text{MeV}\,(1.4\,T_{pc})\,\text{and}\,293\,\text{MeV}\,(1.6\,T_{pc})$. Reconstructing the spectral function from the Euclidean lattice correlator is a well-known ill-posed problem, requiring additional physics-motivated input. We address this by smoothly matching contributions from different frequency regions of the spectral function, using appropriate physics valid for each region. The spectral function around $\omega \sim 2\,M_q$ is obtained using a non-perturbative complex potential, while for $\omega \gg 2\,M_q$ it is modeled using results from vacuum perturbation theory. Since the pseudoscalar channel does not receive a transport contribution near $\omega \sim 0$, we find that the combination of these two regions already provides a good description of the relativistic lattice pseudoscalar correlator. We observe a substantial thermal width in the $\eta_c(1S)$ state, indicating that pseudoscalar charmonium ($\eta_c$) is nearing dissolution at the studied temperatures. In comparison, the $\eta_b$ ground state exhibits little change and remains well-defined.</description>

      <title>Distribution Functions of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Treating baryons as quark + interacting-diquark bound states, a symmetry-preserving formulation of a vector$\,\times\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) is used to deliver an extensive, coherent set of predictions for $\Lambda, \Sigma^0$ baryon unpolarised and polarised distribution functions (DFs) -- valence, glue, and four-flavour separated sea -- and compare them with those of a like-structured nucleon. $\Lambda, \Sigma^0$ baryons are strangeness negative-one isospin partners within the SU$(3)$-flavour baryon octet. This makes such structural comparisons significant. The study reveals impacts of diquark correlations and SU$(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking on $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^0$ structure functions, some of which are significant. For instance, were it not for the presence of axialvector diquarks in the $\Sigma^0$ at the hadron scale, the $s$ quark could carry none of the $\Sigma^0$ spin. The discussion canvasses issues that include helicity retention in hard scattering processes; the sign and size of polarised gluon DFs; and the origin and decomposition of baryon spins. Interpreted judiciously, the SCI analysis delivers an insightful explanation of baryon structure as expressed in DFs.</description>

      <title>Some Aspects of Three-Quark Potentials (Part II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension and interpret the transition between two distinct regimes, occurring when one of the triangle's angles formed by the quarks is equal to $\frac{2}{3}\pi$, as a breaking of permutational symmetry. This symmetry breaking implies the emergence of a heavy quark dressed by gluons, transforming in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Additionally, we discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $\Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Fermion Doubling in Quantum Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA) is essentially an operator driving the evolution of particles on a lattice, through local unitaries. Because $\Delta_x=\Delta_t=\varepsilon$, QCAs constitute a privileged framework to cast the digital quantum simulation of relativistic quantum particles and their interactions with gauge fields, e.g., $(3+1)$D Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). But before they can be adopted, simulation schemes for high-energy physics need prove themselves against specific numerical issues, of which the most infamous is Fermion Doubling (FD). FD is well understood in particular in the discrete-space but continuous-time settings of real-time/Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), as the appearance of spurious solutions for all $\Delta_x=\varepsilon\neq 0$. We rigorously extend this analysis to the real-time discrete-space and discrete-time schemes that QCAs are. We demonstrate the existence of FD issues in QCAs. By applying a covering map on the Brillouin zone, we provide a flavoring-without-staggering way of fixing FD that does not break chiral symmetry. We explain how this method coexists with the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, and illustrate this with a neutrino-like QCA.</description>
