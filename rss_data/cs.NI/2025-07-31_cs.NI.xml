      <title>OpenRASE: Service Function Chain Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) are one of the key enablers in providing programmable computer networks, paving the way for network autonomy. However, this also introduces new challenges, such as resource allocation and optimisation related to their operation, requiring new algorithms to address these challenges. Various tools have been used in the literature to evaluate these algorithms. However, these tools suffer from inaccuracy, low fidelity, unscalability, inflexibility, or additional code requirements. This paper introduces an emulator based on Mininet and Docker for SFCs called OpenRASE. The goal of OpenRASE is to enable the exploration of resource allocation algorithms for SFCs in a dynamic setting, allowing real CPU usage and latency to be measured. We describe the design and implementation of OpenRASE and discuss its characteristics. We also experimentally evaluate two different algorithms to address the SFC resource allocation challenge, including an online Genetic Algorithm, using OpenRASE to show its effectiveness and practicality for dynamic network conditions.</description>

      <title>AdapSCA-PSO: An Adaptive Localization Algorithm with AI-Based Hybrid SCA-PSO for IoT WSNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate localization of sensor nodes is a fundamental requirement for the practical application of the Internet of Things (IoT). To enable robust localization across diverse environments, this paper proposes a hybrid meta-heuristic localization algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm integrates the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), which is effective in global search, with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which excels at local search. An adaptive switching module is introduced to dynamically select between the two algorithms. Furthermore, the initialization, fitness evaluation, and parameter settings of the algorithm have been specifically redesigned and optimized to address the characteristics of the node localization problem. Simulation results across varying numbers of sensor nodes demonstrate that, compared to standalone PSO and the unoptimized SCAPSO algorithm, the proposed method significantly reduces the number of required iterations and achieves an average localization error reduction of 84.97%.</description>

      <title>802.11bf Multiband Passive Sensing: Reusing Wi-Fi Signaling for Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multiband passive sensing system that leverages IEEE 802.11bf Wi-Fi signals for environmental sensing, focusing on both sub-7 GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. By combining Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple bands, the system enhances accuracy and reliability in detecting human presence, movement, and activities in indoor environments. Utilizing a novel model, called MILAGRO, the system demonstrates robust performance across different scenarios, including monitoring human presence in workspaces and tracking movement in corridors. Experimental results show high accuracy (95-100%), with improved performance by integrating multiband data. The system also addresses key security concerns associated with passive sensing, proposing measures to mitigate potential risks. This work advances the use of Wi-Fi for passive sensing by reducing reliance on active sensing infrastructure and extending the capabilities of low-cost, non-intrusive environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Bifr\"{o}st: Spatial Networking with Bigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern networked environments increasingly rely on spatial reasoning, but lack a coherent representation for coordinating physical space. Consequently, tasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We first propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial, social, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with user-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning, with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.</description>

      <title>OFCnetLLM: Large Language Model for Network Monitoring and Alertness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of network infrastructure is bringing new challenges and opportunities for efficient network management, optimization, and security. With very large monitoring databases becoming expensive to explore, the use of AI and Generative AI can help reduce costs of managing these datasets. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize network monitoring management by addressing the limitations of query finding and pattern analysis. We leverage LLMs to enhance anomaly detection, automate root-cause analysis, and automate incident analysis to build a well-monitored network management team using AI. Through a real-world example of developing our own OFCNetLLM, based on the open-source LLM model, we demonstrate practical applications of OFCnetLLM in the OFC conference network. Our model is developed as a multi-agent approach and is still evolving, and we present early results here.</description>

      <title>Morph: ChirpTransformer-based Encoder-decoder Co-design for Reliable LoRa Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Morph, a LoRa encoder-decoder co-design to enhance communication reliability while improving its computation efficiency in extremely-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situations. The standard LoRa encoder controls 6 Spreading Factors (SFs) to tradeoff SNR tolerance with data rate. SF-12 is the maximum SF providing the lowest SNR tolerance on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes. In Morph, we develop an SF-configuration based encoder to mimic the larger SFs beyond SF-12 while it is compatible with COTS LoRa nodes. Specifically, we manipulate four SF configurations of a Morph symbol to encode 2-bit data. Accordingly, we recognize the used SF configuration of the symbol for data decoding. We leverage a Deep Neural Network (DNN) decoder to fully capture multi-dimensional features among diverse SF configurations to maximize the SNR gain. Moreover, we customize the input size, neural network structure, and training method of the DNN decoder to improve its efficiency, reliability, and generalizability. We implement Morph with COTS LoRa nodes and a USRP N210, then evaluate its performance on indoor and campus-scale testbeds. Results show that we can reliably decode data at -28.8~dB SNR, which is 6.4~dB lower than the standard LoRa with SF-12 chirps. In addition, the computation efficiency of our DNN decoder is about 3x higher than state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Hybrid activation functions for deep neural networks: S3 and S4 -- a novel approach to gradient flow optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks, directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance. Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4 (smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression. The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths, making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for improving neural network training dynamics.</description>

      <title>Programmable Data Planes for Network Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of programmable data planes, and particularly switches supporting the P4 language, has transformed network security by enabling customized, line-rate packet processing. These switches, originally intended for flexible forwarding, now play a broader role: detecting and mitigating attacks such as DDoS and spoofing, enforcing next-generation firewall policies, and even supporting in-network cryptography and machine learning. These capabilities are made possible by techniques such as recirculate-and-truncate and lookup-table precomputation, which work around architectural constraints like limited memory and restricted instruction sets. In this paper, we systematize recent advances in security applications built on programmable switches, with an emphasis on the capabilities, challenges, and architectural workarounds. We highlight the non-obvious design techniques that make complex in-network security functions feasible despite the constraints of the hardware platform, and also comment on remaining issues and emerging research directions.</description>

      <title>RIDAS: A Multi-Agent Framework for AI-RAN with Representation- and Intention-Driven Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) networks demand tight integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into radio access networks (RANs) to meet stringent quality of service (QoS) and resource efficiency requirements. Existing solutions struggle to bridge the gap between high level user intents and the low level, parameterized configurations required for optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose RIDAS, a multi agent framework composed of representation driven agents (RDAs) and an intention driven agent (IDA). RDAs expose open interface with tunable control parameters (rank and quantization bits, enabling explicit trade) offs between distortion and transmission rate. The IDA employs a two stage planning scheme (bandwidth pre allocation and reallocation) driven by a large language model (LLM) to map user intents and system state into optimal RDA configurations. Experiments demonstrate that RIDAS supports 36.47% more users than WirelessAgent under equivalent QoS constraints. These results validate ability of RIDAS to capture user intent and allocate resources more efficiently in AI RAN environments.</description>
