      <title>Andreev molecules at distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andreev molecule states arise from hybridization of Andreev bound states in different Josephson Junctions. Extensive theoretical and experimental research concentrates on direct coherent electron coupling between the junctions: this implies the distance between the junctions is of the order of superconducting coherence length, that is, short.
  We propose and discuss the possibility to create Andreev molecules at long (in principle, arbitrary long) distance between the junctions. In this case, the hybridized states are excited quasi-particle singlets and the coupling is provided by an embedding electric circuit. To achieve a strong hybridization, one aligns the energies of the Andreev bound states with associated phase differences. In fact, a recent experiment realizes such setup.
  With circuit theory we derive the hybridization level splitting and estimate the scale of the effect. Since the phenomenon encompasses excited states, we derive and solve the associated Lindblad equation under condition of persistent resonant excitation. By analyzing the resulting dissipative dynamics we identify relevant regimes where the hybridization and resonant excitation peaks are most pronounced. The low-frequency mutual inductance of the Josephson junctions is an important signature of the molecular state and associated non-local Josephson effect. We demonstrate the peak structures for both mutual and self-inductance, and compute them in various frequency regimes.
  In an interesting common case the embedding circuit includes an oscillator, which can be used both to enhance hybridization and for state readout with two-tone spectroscopy. We derive and solve Lindblad equations for the conditions of two-tone spectroscopy to demonstrate the the readout of molecular states.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillation and topology change of the uncondensed Landau Fermi surface in superconducting CeCoIn5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals typically have multiple Fermi surface sheets, and when they enter the superconducting state, some electrons on these sheets may remain uncondensed, or their superconducting pairs can be rapidly destroyed by a magnetic field. Detecting uncondensed electrons within the superconducting state provides key information about the underlying electronic structure; however, this task remains a significant experimental challenge. Here we demonstrate quantum oscillations from the uncondensed electrons in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5, observed through thermal conductivity measurements with a magnetic field rotating within the tetragonal a-b plane. We detect a fine structure in thermal conductivity, characterized by multiple small resonances (oscillations) in a rotating magnetic field. Remarkably, the phase of these resonances shifted by as much as {\pi} for a field above 9.7 T where spin-density wave (SDW) order emerges and coexists with superconductivity. This phase shift is naturally explained by a change in the Berry phase of the uncondensed Fermi surface, driven by the Fermi surface reconstruction associated with the onset of SDW order. Our work unambiguously shows the existence of uncondensed electrons in the superconducting state of CeCoIn5, thus resolving a longstanding debate on this issue.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale Frustrated Josephson Coupling and Multi-condensate Visualization in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Josephson junction involving multi-band superconductors, competition between inter-band and inter-junction Josephson coupling gives rise to frustration and spatial disjunction of superfluid densities among superconducting condensates. Such frustrated coupling manifests as quantum interference of Josephson currents from different tunneling channels and becomes tunable if channel transparency can be varied. To explore these unconventional effects in the prototypical $s^\pm$-wave superconductor FeSe, we use atomic resolution scanned Josephson tunneling microscopy SJTM for condensate resolved imaging and junction tuning -- capabilities unattainable in macroscopic Josephson devices with fixed characteristics. We quantitatively demonstrate frustrated Josephson tunneling by examining two tunneling inequalities. The relative transparency of two parallel tunneling pathways is found tunable, revealing a tendency towards a 0-pi transition with decreasing SJTM junction resistance. Simultaneous visualization of both superconducting condensates reveals anti correlated superfluid modulations, highlighting the role of inter-band scattering. Our study establishes SJTM as a powerful tool enabling new research frontiers of multi condensate superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and sub-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.</description>

      <title>Unconventional charge density wave in Kagome metal BaFe2Al9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW) is a macroscopic quantum state characterized by long-range lattice distortion and modulated charge density. Conventionally, CDWs compete with other electronic orders (e.g. superconductivity) and are suppressed under hydrostatic pressure. Intriguingly, the Kagome-variant metal BaFe2Al9, crystallized in a three-dimensional structure, exhibits pressure-enhanced CDW ordering, where the transition temperature (TCDW) rises from ~110 K to room temperature near 3.6 GPa. The lattice structure was checked by both powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD data reveals an abnormal lattice expansion along a axis near 4-5 GPa upon compression. The strongly suppressed diffraction intensity and splitting diffraction spots from single crystal indicates cracking and breakdown to smaller pieces, indicative of an intrinsic first-order transition character. This anomalous response implies a CDW mechanism dominated by electron-electron and/or electron-phonon correlations, distinct from Fermi-surface nesting in conventional systems. Concomitant dome-shaped pressure-dependent resistance suggests competing electronic phases. Our work establishes BaFe2Al9 as a 3D Kagome platform with unconventional CDW behavior and strong electron-phonon coupling, which provides an alternative platform to explore the electron correlation induced exotic electronic states and other potential emergent quantum phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Abelian-Higgs vortices in the oscillating axion background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Abelian-Higgs vortices in the background of a coherently oscillating axion field. We show that the electric field is induced in the magnetic core of the vortex due to the axion-photon conversion. Moreover, because the electromagnetic field is confined in the vortex and excluded from the superconducting bulk regions due to the Meissner effect, the vortex tube can be regarded as a cylindrical cavity, and our numerical analysis shows that the resonant cavity mode (TM010 mode) can be efficiently enhanced in this tube. We also focus on the interaction of two vortices in the oscillating axion background, resulting in attractive or repulsive forces, even in the case with the BPS limit. These new features open up a new possibility for the axion dark matter search using superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium regimes for quasiparticles in superconducting qubits with gap-asymmetric junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits hold promise for quantum computing, but their operation is challenged by various sources of noise, including excitations known as quasiparticles. Qubits with gap asymmetry larger than their transition energy are less susceptible to quasiparticle decoherence as the quasiparticles are mostly trapped in the low-gap side of the junction. Because of this trapping, the gap asymmetry can contribute to maintaining the quasiparticles out of equilibrium. Here we address the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle densities in the two sides of the junction. We show that four qualitatively different regimes are possible with increasing temperature: i) nonequilibrium, ii) local quasiequilibrium, iii) global quasiequilibrium, and iv) full equilibrium. We identify shortcomings in assuming global quasiequilibrium when interpreting experimental data, highlighting how measurements in the presence of magnetic field can aid the accurate determination of the junction parameters, and hence the identification of the nonequilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cooper pairing in nano-patterned metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nano-patterning has been shown to be a powerful tool for manipulating the vibrational modes of elastic structures, with applications such as optical-mechanical mode coupling. Inspired by these recent developments in phononic band engineering, we propose a nano-patterning scheme to enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in phonon-mediated nano-film superconductors, such as aluminum. Using the finite element method, we simulate the lattice vibrational modes of nano-patterned films within the Debye model. Our results show that periodic nano-patterning softens the lattice vibrational modes compared to bulk films. It also increases the density of states at high energies, resulting in a couple of percent enhancement in $T_c$. Moreover, we investigate connections to Weyl's law and provide an experimental design prescription to optimize nano-patterning for further enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase diagram of finite-layer nickelates Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the successful prediction of the superconducting phase diagram for infinite-layer nickelates, here we calculate the superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ vs. the number of layers $n$ for finite-layer nickelates using the dynamical vertex approximation. To this end, we start with density functional theory, and include local correlations non-perturbatively by dynamical mean-field theory for $n=2$ to 7. For all $n$, the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital crosses the Fermi level, but for $n&gt;4$ there are additional $(\pi, \pi)$ pockets or tubes that slightly enhance the layer-averaged hole doping of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals beyond the leading $1/n$ contribution stemming from the valence electron count. We finally calculate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the single-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Hubbard model by dynamical vertex approximation.</description>
