      <title>Monitoring Deployed AI Systems in Health Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-deployment monitoring of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in health care is essential to ensure their safety, quality, and sustained benefit-and to support governance decisions about which systems to update, modify, or decommission. Motivated by these needs, we developed a framework for monitoring deployed AI systems grounded in the mandate to take specific actions when they fail to behave as intended. This framework, which is now actively used at Stanford Health Care, is organized around three complementary principles: system integrity, performance, and impact. System integrity monitoring focuses on maximizing system uptime, detecting runtime errors, and identifying when changes to the surrounding IT ecosystem have unintended effects. Performance monitoring focuses on maintaining accurate system behavior in the face of changing health care practices (and thus input data) over time. Impact monitoring assesses whether a deployed system continues to have value in the form of benefit to clinicians and patients. Drawing on examples of deployed AI systems at our academic medical center, we provide practical guidance for creating monitoring plans based on these principles that specify which metrics to measure, when those metrics should be reviewed, who is responsible for acting when metrics change, and what concrete follow-up actions should be taken-for both traditional and generative AI. We also discuss challenges to implementing this framework, including the effort and cost of monitoring for health systems with limited resources and the difficulty of incorporating data-driven monitoring practices into complex organizations where conflicting priorities and definitions of success often coexist. This framework offers a practical template and starting point for health systems seeking to ensure that AI deployments remain safe and effective over time.</description>

      <title>Food, Affection and Gaze: Which Cues do Free-Ranging Dogs Consider for Engaging with Humans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) constitute the majority of the global dog population and rely heavily on human-derived resources. Studies show different levels of responses to various cues like food, petting and gazing by humans. However, the relative importance that dogs associate with these rewards, driving their interactions with unfamiliar humans remain understudied. Understanding how these dogs prioritize different rewards, ranging from food to social contact, can offer insights into their adaptive strategies within human-dominated ecosystems, and help to reduce conflict. We investigated the motivational value of different reward types in 150 adult free-ranging dogs in West Bengal, India. Using a between-subjects design, unfamiliar experimenters offered one of five rewards: high-value food (chicken), low-value food (biscuit), social interaction (petting), human gaze only, or human presence only. Motivation was assessed by measuring the number of rewards accepted, approach latency, duration of proximity, and behaviour via a Socialization Index (SI). High-value food was the most potent driver of approach behaviour and sustained proximity. While petting elicited higher SI scores, indicating affiliative engagement, it was associated with more rapid satiation than food. Human gaze alone functioned as a subtle reinforcer compared to passive presence, maintaining dog attention longer than presence alone. These findings suggest that free-ranging dogs prioritize high-energy intake over social interaction with strangers, consistent with an optimal foraging strategy. This behavioural flexibility enables them to balance energy needs against potential risks, demonstrating the sophisticated decision-making crucial for survival in urban environments where humans act as both resource providers and potential threats.</description>
