      <title>Elementary atoms in spaces of constant curvature by the Nikiforov-Uvarov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is a simple, yet elegant and powerful method for solving second-order differential equations of generalized hypergeometric type. In the past, it has been used to solve many problems in quantum mechanics and elsewhere. We apply this method to the classical problem of hydrogen-like atoms in spaces of constant curvature. Both the spectra of these atoms and their wave functions, including normalization, are easily obtained.</description>

      <title>Ergotropy-Based Quantum Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an ergotropy-based formulation of quantum thermodynamics, which provides a strong connection between average heat and von Neumann entropy. By adopting this formulation, we can reinterpret the infinitesimal average heat in terms of the infinitesimal change of the passive state associated with the density operator behind the quantum dynamics. Such as entropy, this leads to a heat concept that is invariant under passive state transformations. As an application, the average heat can be used as a general non-Markovinity measure for unital maps. Moreover, a positive-semidefinite temperature naturally emerges in an out-of-equilibrium ergotropy-based scenario. Concerning the infinitesimal average work, it arises as the infinitesimal variation of ergotropy, as well as an extra passive work contribution in the case of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. As illustrations, we consider the thermodynamics of a single-qubit open system in the cases of generalized amplitude-damping and phase-damping channels.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum dimerization in 2D atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a 2D atomic array coupled to different photonic environments, focusing on the half-filled excitation subspace, where strong photon interactions can give rise to complex many-body states. In particular, we demonstrate that the least radiant state in this sector is well described by a coherent superposition of all possible quantum dimer coverings: a resonating valence bond (RVB) liquid state. We discuss possible strategies to probe this exotic state, along with their limitations and challenges. Finally, we show that such a quantum dimer covering can also emerge as the ground state of the coherent Hamiltonian describing a 2D atomic array coupled to a photonic band-gap material.</description>

      <title>Kernpiler: Compiler Optimization for Quantum Hamiltonian Simulation with Partial Trotterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises transformative impacts in simulating Hamiltonian dynamics, essential for studying physical systems inaccessible by classical computing. However, existing compilation techniques for Hamiltonian simulation, in particular the commonly used Trotter formulas struggle to provide gate counts feasible on current quantum computers for beyond-classical simulations. We propose partial Trotterization, where sets of non-commuting Hamiltonian terms are directly compiled allowing for less error per Trotter step and therefore a reduction of Trotter steps overall. Furthermore, a suite of novel optimizations are introduced which complement the new partial Trotterization technique, including reinforcement learning for complex unitary decompositions and high level Hamiltonian analysis for unitary reduction. We demonstrate with numerical simulations across spin and fermionic Hamiltonians that compared to state of the art methods such as Qiskit's Rustiq and Qiskit's Paulievolutiongate, our novel compiler presents up to 10x gate and depth count reductions.</description>

      <title>Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $&gt;90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Characterising the failure mechanisms of error-corrected quantum logic gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements used in quantum error correction are essential in quantum computer architecture, as they read out syndrome data and drive logic gates. Here, we use a heavy-hex code prepared on a superconducting qubit array to investigate how different noise sources impact error-corrected logic. First, we identify that idling errors occurring during readout periods are highly detrimental to a quantum memory. We demonstrate significant improvements to the memory by designing and implementing a low-depth syndrome extraction circuit. Second, we perform a stability experiment to investigate the type of failures that can occur during logic gates due to readout assignment errors. We find that the error rate of the stability experiment improves with additional stabilizer readout cycles, revealing a trade-off as additional stability comes at the expense of time over which the memory can decay. We corroborate our results using holistic device benchmarking and by comparison to numerical simulations. Finally, by varying different parameters in our simulations we identify the key noise sources that impact the fidelity of fault-tolerant logic gates, with measurement noise playing a dominant role in logical gate performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Parameter-Based Training Performance of Neural Networks and Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, neural networks (NNs) have driven significant advances in machine learning. However, as tasks grow more complex, NNs often require large numbers of trainable parameters, which increases computational and energy demands. Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) offer a promising alternative: they leverage quantum mechanics to capture intricate relationships and typically need fewer parameters. In this work, we evaluate NNs and VQCs on simple supervised and reinforcement learning tasks, examining models with different parameter sizes. We simulate VQCs and execute selected parts of the training process on real quantum hardware to approximate actual training times. Our results show that VQCs can match NNs in performance while using significantly fewer parameters, despite longer training durations. As quantum technology and algorithms advance, and VQC architectures improve, we posit that VQCs could become advantageous for certain machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-Hop Quantum Communication using Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new method for Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation called Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation using the Modified Dijkstra Algorithm and Quantum Walk (BQT-MDQW). This method uses different types of entangled states, such as the GHZ-Bell state, W-Bell state, and Cluster-Bell state, to improve quantum communication in multi-hop quantum wireless networks. We focus on the W-Bell state and compare the quantum Dijkstra algorithm with the classical Dijkstra method to see which one works better. We apply both versions to quantum and classical simulators, measuring their performance through fidelity, memory utilization, and throughput calculations. Our results show that the shortest path problem may be solved with significantly reduced computer complexity using the quantum Dijkstra algorithm based on quantum walks. The introduction of a quantum walk, which permits dynamic transitions between quantum channels and the effective exploration of quantum network states, is an important part of the protocol. Using the capacity of the quantum walk to adjust to changing quantum states, we also introduce a method for successfully identifying unitary matrices under varying quantum channels. The bidirectional teleportation structure of the protocol is designed to solve the multi-hop teleportation problem in quantum wireless networks. In addition, we present quantum Dijkstra's algorithm, which uses quantum gates to significantly decrease computational complexity and solve the networking problem by building on the quantum walk framework. This method shows how quantum computing may be used to solve arbitrary optimization issues such as the shortest path problem. Finally, we present a novel multi-hop quantum teleportation system encompassing both unidirectional and bidirectional communication, as introduced in the quantum Dijkstra algorithm system...</description>

      <title>Learning to erase quantum states: thermodynamic implications of quantum learning theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>A millisecond integrated quantum memory for photonic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memories for light are essential building blocks for quantum repeaters and quantum networks. Integrated operations of quantum memories could enable scalable application with low-power consumption. However, the photonic quantum storage lifetime in integrated optical waveguide has so far been limited to tens of microseconds, falling short of the requirements for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate quantum storage of photonic qubits for 1.021 ms based on a laser-written optical waveguide fabricated in a 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 crystal. Spin dephasing of 151Eu3+ is mitigated through dynamical decoupling applied via on-chip electric waveguides and we obtain a storage efficiency of 12.0(0.5)% at 1.021 ms, which is a demonstration of integrated quantum memories that outperforms the efficiency of a simple fiber delay line. Such long-lived waveguide-based quantum memory could support applications in quantum repeaters, and further combination with critical magnetic fields could enable potential application as transportable quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically tight security analysis of quantum key distribution based on universal source compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols require a finite-size security proof. The phase error correction (PEC) approach is one of the general strategies for security analyses that has successfully proved finite-size security for many protocols. However, the asymptotically optimal key rate cannot in general be achieved with the conventional PEC approach due to the reduction to the estimation problem of the classical quantity, the phase error rate. In this work, we propose a new PEC-type strategy that can provably achieve the asymptotically optimal key rate. The key piece for this is a virtual protocol based on the universal source compression with quantum side information, which is of independent interest. Combined with the reduction method to collective attacks, this enables us to directly estimate the phase error pattern rather than the estimation via the phase error rate, and thus leads to asymptotically tight analyses. As a result, the security of any permutation-symmetrizable QKD protocol gets reduced to the estimation problem of the single conditional R\'enyi entropy, which can be efficiently solved by a convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on rotation measurement with a quantum vibration oscillator based on Penning trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional mechanics, harmonic oscillators can be used to measure force, acceleration, or rotation. Herein, we describe a quantum harmonic oscillator based on a penning trapped calcium ion crystal. Similar to traditional oscillators, the Coriolis force induced axial oscillation amplitude is precisely measured to determine the input velocity. We show that the magnetron motion can be controlled through the rotating wall driving and treated as the driving oscillator. The Coriolis force couples with the magnetron motion and induces vibration in the axial direction or the $z$ direction. The center of mass motion of the ion crystal in the axial direction could be precisely detected by the entanglement between the spins of the ions and the harmonic motion through lasers. The frequency of the magnetron motion needs to meet that of the axial motion under certain conditions and thus the axial motion could be tuned to the resonance peak for maximum detection signal. We gave the parameter spaces for the meeting of the magnetron frequencies to that of the axial frequencies. The measurement sensitivity was calculated in details and results show that rotation angular velocity of $3.0\times10^{-9}rad/s/\sqrt{Hz}$ could achieve with 10000 ions. Amplitude sensing could reach sensitivity of 0.4$pm/\sqrt{Hz}$. With spin squeezing, the sensitivity could be further improved.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement systems based on qudits dilate high-dimensional (HD) state spaces and enhance resistance to loss in quantum information processing (QIP). To fully exploit this potential, effective schemes for generating HD entanglement are crucial. In this paper, we propose a flexible heralded scheme generating random 4D two-qudit maximal entanglement for hybrid photon-emitter system by entering different input ports. This approach can be further extended to prepare 4D n-qudit (n is greater than or equal 3) maximal entanglement utilizing the 4D single-qudit Z^m (m=1,2,3) gate for the first qudit and X^m gate for the other qudits (except the second qudit). For the hybrid system, the first 4D qudit is encoded on the hybrid polarization-path states of a flying photon, while the second and subsequent 4D qudits are represented by two stationary emitters coupled to respective 1D waveguide. The qudit-encoded hybrid HD entanglement offers advantages over economizing quantum resource without any auxiliary qudits, and obtaining robust fidelities of various HD entanglement by the error-detected mechanism of the emitter-waveguide systems. Moreover, the proposed protocol can be spread to generate dD n-qudit (d is greater than or equal 2^(p+1), n, p=2,3,...) entangled states, further broadening its applicability in HD QIP.</description>

      <title>Non-Haar random circuits form unitary designs as fast as Haar random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unitary design formation in random circuits has attracted considerable attention due to its wide range of practical applications and relevance to fundamental physics. While the formation rates in Haar random circuits have been extensively studied in previous works, it remains an open question how these rates are affected by the choice of local randomizers. In this work, we prove that the circuit depths required for general non-Haar random circuits to form unitary designs are upper bounded by those for the corresponding Haar random circuits, up to a constant factor independent of the system size. This result is derived in a broad range of circuit structures, including one- and higher-dimensional lattices, geometrically non-local configurations, and even extremely shallow circuits with patchwork architectures. We provide specific applications of these results in randomized benchmarking and random circuit sampling, and also discuss their implications for quantum many-body physics. Our work lays the foundation for flexible and robust randomness generation in real-world experiments, and offers new insights into chaotic dynamics in complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Automating quantum feature map design via large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum feature maps are a key component of quantum machine learning, encoding classical data into quantum states to exploit the expressive power of high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Despite their theoretical promise, designing quantum feature maps that offer practical advantages over classical methods remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose an agentic system that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines quantum feature maps using large language models. The system consists of five component: Generation, Storage, Validation, Evaluation, and Review. Using these components, it iteratively improves quantum feature maps. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show that it can successfully discover and refine feature maps without human intervention. The best feature map generated outperforms existing quantum baselines and achieves competitive accuracy compared to classical kernels across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Our approach provides a framework for exploring dataset-adaptive quantum features and highlights the potential of LLM-driven automation in quantum algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Distributing graph states with a photon-weaving quantum server</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key aims of quantum networks is the efficient distribution of multipartite entangled states among end users. While various architectures have been proposed, each comes with distinct advantages and limitations. Many designs depend on long-lived quantum memories and deterministic gates, which, while powerful, introduce considerable cost and technical challenges. Experimentally cheaper alternatives that circumvent these constraints are often limited to specific types of entanglement and a specific number of users. Here, we present an experiment-friendly quantum server that relies only on linear optical elements, offering a flexible approach to multipartite entanglement distribution. Our so-called photon-weaving quantum server can generate and distribute one of several locally nonequivalent graph states, including Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, as well as path, cycle, and caterpillar graph states. This is achieved through two distinct fusion protocols, i.e., multiphoton graph-state fusion (graph-state weaving) and multiphoton GHZ-state fusion (GHZ-state weaving), and can readily be implemented.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantification of Bipartite Entanglement in Unresolvable Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying mixed-state entanglement in many-body systems has been a formidable task. In this work, we quantify the entanglement of states in unresolvable spin ensembles, which are inherently mixed. By exploiting their permutationally invariant properties, we show that the bipartite entanglement of a wide range of unresolvable ensemble states can be calculated exactly. Our formalism is versatile; it can be used to evaluate the entanglement in an ensemble with an arbitrary number of particles, effective angular momentum, and bipartition. We apply our method to explore the characteristics of entanglement in different physically motivated scenarios, including states with definite magnetization and metrologically useful superpositions such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and spin-squeezed states. Our method can help understand the role of entanglement in spin-ensemble-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Stable and Efficient Charging of Superconducting C-shunt Flux Quantum Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, as miniature energy storage devices, have sparked significant research interest in recent years. However, achieving rapid and stable energy transfer in quantum batteries while obeying quantum speed limits remains a critical challenge. In this work, we experimentally optimize the charging process by leveraging the unique energy level structure of a superconducting capacitively-shunted flux qubit, using counterdiabatic pulses in the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. Compared to previous studies, we impose two different norm constraints on the driving Hamiltonian, achieving optimal charging without exceeding the overall driving strength. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate a charging process that achieves the quantum speed limit. In addition, we introduce a dimensionless parameter $\mathcal{S}$ to unify charging speed and stability, offering a universal metric for performance optimization. In contrast to metrics such as charging power and thermodynamic efficiency, the $\mathcal{S}$ criterion quantitatively captures the stability of ergentropy while also considering the charging speed. Our results highlight the potential of the capacitively-shunted qubit platform as an ideal candidate for realizing three-level quantum batteries and deliver novel strategies for optimizing energy transfer protocols.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transition, metastable state, and dimensionality reduction: Krylov analysis of fully-connected spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quenched dynamics of fully-connected spin models. The system is prepared in a ground state of the initial Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian is suddenly changed to a different form. We apply the Krylov subspace method to map the system onto an effective tridiagonal Hamiltonian. The state is confined in a potential well and is time-evolved by nonuniform hoppings. The dynamical singularities for the survival probability can occur when the state is reflected from a potential barrier. Although we do not observe any singularity in the spread complexity, we find that the entropy exhibits small dips at the singular times. We find that the presence of metastable state affects long-time behavior of the spread complexity, and physical observables. We also observe a reduction of the state-space dimension when the Hamiltonian reduces to a classical form.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode free-space delay interferometer with no refractive compensation elements for phase encoded QKD protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate compensation-free approach to the realization of multi-mode delay interferometers, mainly for use in phase encoded quantum key distribution (QKD). High interference visibility of spatially multimode beams in unbalanced Michelson or Mach-Zehnder interferometers with a relatively wide range of delays is achieved by the appropriate choice of the transverse size of the beam. We provide a simple theoretical model that gives a direct connection between the visibility of interference, the delay, and the beam parameters. The performed experimental study confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrates the measured visibility of up to 0.95 for the delay of 2 ns. Our approach's simplicity and robust performance make it a practical choice for the implementation of QKD systems, where a quantum signal is received over a multimode fiber. The important application of such configuration is an intermodal QKD system, where the free-space atmospheric communication channel is coupled into a span of the multimode fiber, delivering the spatially distorted beam to the remote receiver with minimal coupling loss.</description>

      <title>Large amplitude mechanical coherent states and detection of weak nonlinearities in cavity optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of large-amplitude coherent states of a massive mechanical resonator, and their quantum-limited detection represent useful tools for quantum sensing and for testing fundamental physics theories. In fact, any weak perturbation may affect the coherent quantum evolution of the prepared state, providing a sensitive probe for such a perturbation. Here we consider a cavity optomechanical setup and the case of the detection of a weak mechanical nonlinearity. We consider different strategies, first focusing on the stationary dynamics in the presence of multiple tones driving the system, and then focusing on non-equilibrium dynamical strategies. These methods can be successfully applied for measuring Duffing-like material nonlinearities, or effective nonlinear corrections associated with quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum algorithm for computing the determinant of a unitary matrix $U\in U(N)$ is given. The algorithm requires no preparation of eigenstates of $U$ and estimates the phase of the determinant to $t$ binary digits accuracy with $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2 N+t^2)$ operations and $tN$ controlled applications of $U^{2^m}$ with $m=0,\ldots,t-1$. For an orthogonal matrix $O\in O(N)$ the algorithm can determine with certainty the sign of the determinant using $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2 N)$ operations and $N$ controlled applications of $O$. An extension of the algorithm to contractions is discussed.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using a parameterized quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform digital quantum simulations of the noninteracting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model using a parameterized quantum circuit. The circuit comprises two main components: the first prepares the initial state from the product state $|0\rangle^{\otimes L}$, where $L$ is the system size; the second consists of $M$ layers of brick-wall unitaries simulating time evolution. The evolution times, encoded as the rotation angles of quantum gates in the second part, are optimized variationally to minimize the energy. The SSH model exhibits two distinct topological phases, depending on the relative strengths of inter- and intra-cell hopping amplitudes. We investigate the evolution of the energy, entanglement entropy, and mutual information towards topologically trivial and nontrivial ground states. Our results find the follows: (i) When the initial and target ground states belong to the same topological phase, the variational energy decreases exponentially, the entanglement entropy quickly saturates in a system-size-independent manner, and the mutual information remains spatially localized, as the number of layers increases. (ii) When the initial and target ground states belong to different topological phases, the variational energy decreases polynomially, the entanglement entropy initially grows logarithmically before decreasing, and the mutual information spreads ballistically across the entire system, with increasing the number of layers. Furthermore, by calculating the polarization, we identify a topological phase transition occurring at an intermediate circuit layer when the initial and final target states lie in different topological characters. Finally, we experimentally confirm this topological phase transition in an 18-site system using 19 qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer provided by Quantinuum.</description>

      <title>Lifetime-limited Gigahertz-frequency Mechanical Oscillators with Millisecond Coherence Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency mechanical oscillators with long coherence times are essential to realizing a variety of high-fidelity quantum sensors, transducers, and memories. However, the unprecedented coherence times needed for quantum applications require exquisitely sensitive new techniques to probe the material origins of phonon decoherence and new strategies to mitigate decoherence in mechanical oscillators. Here, we combine non-invasive laser spectroscopy techniques with materials analysis to identify key sources of phonon decoherence in crystalline media. Using micro-fabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators ($\mu$HBARs) as an experimental testbed, we identify phonon-surface interactions as the dominant source of phonon decoherence in crystalline quartz; lattice distortion, subsurface damage, and high concentration of elemental impurities near the crystal surface are identified as the likely causes. Removal of this compromised surface layer using an optimized polishing process is seen to greatly enhance coherence times, enabling $\mu$HBARs with Q-factors of &gt; 240 million at 12 GHz frequencies, corresponding to &gt; 6 ms phonon coherence times and record-level f-Q products. Complementary phonon linewidth and time-domain ringdown measurements, performed using a new Brillouin-based pump-probe spectroscopy technique, reveal negligible dephasing within these oscillators. Building on these results, we identify a path to &gt; 100 ms coherence times as the basis for high-frequency quantum memories. These findings clearly demonstrate that, with enhanced control over surfaces, dissipation and noise can be significantly reduced in a wide range of quantum systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the Helium (He) molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems. This work highlights the potential of quantum processors in the fields of quantum chemistry, computational physics, and data science.</description>

Abstract: Nanodiamonds (NDs) are quantum sensors that enable local temperature measurements, taking advantage of their small size. Though the model based analysis methods have been used for ND quantum thermometry, their accuracy has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we apply model-free machine learning with the Gaussian process regression (GPR) to ND quantum thermometry and compare its capabilities with the existing methods. We prove that GPR provides more robust results than them, even for a small number of data points and regardless of the data acquisition methods. This study extends the range of applications of ND quantum thermometry with machine learning.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Superatom Interface for Topological Microwave-to-Optical Photon Conversion in Fock-State Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave-to-optical conversion (MTOC) of single photons plays a pivotal role in bridging quantum devices across different frequency domains, but faces challenges in maintaining efficiency and robustness against fluctuations and dissipation in hybrid quantum systems. Here, we propose a topologically protected MTOC scheme mediated by a Rydberg superatom to address these limitations. By constructing cross-linked Fock-state lattices (FSLs) through a dual-mode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) architecture, we map the effective hybrid system onto an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger~(SSH) model with tunable hopping rates. Photon-number--dependent property of hopping rates triggers a topological phase transition in the extended SSH chain, converting the defect mode into a topological channel that directionally pumps photons between microwave and optical cavities. This mechanism leverages Rydberg blockade-enhanced photon-superatom couplings to establish a robust energy transfer channel, achieving high-efficiency photon conversion under realistic decoherence. Our theoretical framework demonstrates how topological protection synergizes with Rydberg-mediated light-matter interactions to realize a robust quantum transducer, providing a scalable platform for noise-resilient quantum networks and frequency-multiplexed quantum interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Hyperbolic quantum error correction codes (HQECCs) leverage the unique geometric properties of hyperbolic space to enhance the capabilities and performance of quantum error correction. By embedding qubits in hyperbolic lattices, HQECCs achieve higher encoding rates and improved error thresholds compared to conventional Euclidean codes. Building on recent advances in hyperbolic crystallography, we present a systematic framework for constructing HQECCs. As a key component of this framework, we develop a novel algorithm for computing all plaquette cycles and logical operators associated with a given HQECC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we utilize this framework to simulate two HQECCs based respectively on two relevant examples of hyperbolic tilings. In the process, we evaluate key code parameters such as encoding rate, error threshold, and code distance for different sub-lattices. This work establishes a solid foundation for a systematic and comprehensive analysis of HQECCs, paving the way for the practical implementation of HQECCs in the pursuit of robust quantum error correction strategies.</description>

      <title>Locality Implies Complex Numbers in Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a real-number quantum theory, compatible with the independent source assumption, requires the inclusion of a nonlocal map. This means that if the independent source assumption holds, complex-number quantum theory is equivalent to a real-number quantum theory with hidden nonlocal degrees of freedom. This result suggests that complex numbers are indispensable for describing the process involving entanglement between two independent systems. That is, quantum theory fundamentally requires complex numbers; otherwise, one may have to accept a nonlocal real-number quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Numerical instability of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme sensitivity of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has been extensively studied in recent years with well-established theoretical explanations. However, this sensitivity is often overlooked in numerical calculations, as seen in Refs. \cite{NHSEEPTKawabata, Schiro}. In this work, we examine the solvable Hatano-Nelson and symplectic Hatano-Nelson models, comparing our high-precision results with those in Ref. \cite{NHSEEPTKawabata}. We systematically investigate inaccuracies in physical results arising from neglecting numerical errors during diagonalization and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolution. Moreover, we attribute these numerical instabilities to the large condition number, which grows exponentially with system size due to NHSE, indicating strong normality. Interestingly, it is found that a reliable spectrum alone is insufficient for accurate non-Hermitian evolution, while the reliability of wavefunctions plays a more critical role. To ensure the accuracy of numerical results for non-Hermitian systems exhibiting NHSE, our work underscores the importance of estimating the condition number before performing numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Estimating entanglement monotones of non-pure spin-squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how to estimate entanglement monotones of general mixed many-body quantum states via lower and upper bounds from entanglement witnesses and separable ansatz states respectively. This allows us to study spin systems on fully-connected graphs at nonzero temperature. We derive lower bounds to distance-like measure from the set of fully separable states based on spin-squeezing inequalities. These are nonlinear expressions based on variances of collective spin operators and are potentially close to optimal in the large particle-number limit, at least for models with two-particle interactions. Concretely, we apply our methods to equilibrium states of the permutation-invariant XXZ model with an external field and investigate entanglement at nonzero temperature close to quantum phase transition (QPT) points in both the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic cases. We observe that the lower bound becomes tight for zero temperature as well as for the temperature at which entanglement disappears, both of which are thus precisely captured by the spin-squeezing inequalities. We further observe, among other things, that entanglement arises at nonzero temperature close to a QPT even in the ordered phase, where the ground state is separable. This can be considered an entanglement signature of a QPT that may also be visible in experiments.</description>

      <title>Operator growth in many-body systems of higher spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study operator growth in many-body systems with on-site spins larger than $1/2$, considering both non-integrable and integrable regimes. Specifically, we compute Lanczos coefficients in the one- and two-dimensional Ising models for spin values $S=1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$, and observe asymptotically linear growth $b_n \sim n$. On the integrable side, we investigate the Potts model and find square-root growth $b_n \sim \sqrt{n}$. Both results are consistent with the predictions of the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. To analyze operator dynamics in this setting, we employ a generalized operator basis constructed from tensor products of shift and clock operators, extending the concept of Pauli strings to higher local dimensions. We further report that the recently introduced formalism of equivalence classes of Pauli strings can be naturally extended to this setting. This formalism enables the study of simulable Heisenberg dynamics by identifying dynamically isolated operator subspaces of moderate dimensionality. As an example, we introduce the Kitaev-Potts model with spin-$1$, where the identification of such a subspace allows for exact time evolution at a computational cost lower than that of exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>QubitHammer Attacks: Qubit Flipping Attacks in Multi-tenant Superconducting Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly evolving its capabilities, with a corresponding surge in its deployment within cloud-based environments. Various quantum computers are accessible today via pay-as-you-go cloud computing models, offering unprecedented convenience. Due to its rapidly growing demand, quantum computers are shifting from a single-tenant to a multi-tenant model to enhance resource utilization. However, this widespread accessibility to shared multi-tenant systems also introduces potential security vulnerabilities. In this work, we present for the first time a set of novel attacks, named together as the QubitHammer attacks, which target state-of-the-art superconducting quantum computers. We show that in a multi-tenant cloud-based quantum system, an adversary with the basic capability to deploy custom pulses, similar to any standard user today, can utilize the QubitHammer attacks to significantly degrade the fidelity of victim circuits located on the same quantum computer. Upon extensive evaluation, the QubitHammer attacks achieve a very high variational distance of up to 0.938 from the expected outcome, thus demonstrating their potential to degrade victim computation. Our findings exhibit the effectiveness of these attacks across various superconducting quantum computers from a leading vendor, suggesting that QubitHammer represents a new class of security attacks. Further, the attacks are demonstrated to bypass all existing defenses proposed so far for ensuring the reliability in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Temporal Tensors and Quantum Shortcut Dynamics in a Supermaze of Multidimensional Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that unifies concepts of multiple time dimensions, quantum shortcut dynamics, and complex topological structures ('supermazes') to explore novel phenomena in quantum and classical systems. In particular, we introduce a Temporal Tensor Formalism to describe multidimensional time, define Quantum Shortcut Operators that enact near-instantaneous state transitions, and incorporate these into a supermaze topological model inspired by labyrinthine geometry and network complexity. We show how this framework can give rise to surprising effects such as anomalous thermodynamic relaxation (analogous to the Mpemba effect) in quantum systems. Theoretical implications for quantum computing (including quantum cloud networks) are discussed, and connections are drawn to established mathematical paradoxes and physical principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We transform the counting function for the Riemann zeros into a Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) determinant, assisted by Krein's theorem. This is based on our observation that the function derived from a few methods can all be recast into two terms: one corresponds to the scattering phase, and the other is similar to structure constants related to the Green function. We also discuss the possible physical realizations. Our method provides a new physical pathway towards the solution of the Riemann hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed Limit in Driven-dissipative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every quantum operation that takes a system from one state to another is known to have bounds on operation time, due to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In open quantum systems (OQS), such bounds have been principally affected by system environment coupling. In the recent past, drives on OQS have shown to give rise to drive-induced dissipation (DID). In this work, we investigate how DID affects the quantum speed limits. To this end, we use a recently-reported quantum master equation that takes into account environment fluctuations and provide a closed form estimate of drive-induced dissipation. On such a system, we use Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to find optimal route to move from an initial state to a desired final state. Our key result is that there exists an optimal evolution time that maximizes fidelity. This work enables robust quantum control in open systems, addressing a key challenge in scaling quantum technologies. By improving fidelity and efficiency, our method advances practical quantum computing under realistic dissipative conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction via multi-particle discrete-time quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme of quantum error correction that employs a multi-particle quantum walk defined on nested squares, each hosting a single particle. In this model, each particle moves within its own distinct square through iterations of three discrete-time steps. First, a particle updates its two-level internal {\it coin} state. Next, it either moves to an adjacent vertex or stays put, depending on the outcome. Finally, it interacts with another particle if these particles arrive at the nearest-neighbor vertices of the two adjacent squares, acquiring a phase factor of $-1$. Because a single particle represents a three-qubit state through its position and coin state, Shor's nine-qubit code is implemented using only three particles, with two additional particles for syndrome measurement. Furthermore, by exploiting gauge symmetry, our scheme achieves redundant encoding, error correction, and arbitrary operations on the encoded information using only nearest-neighbor interactions.</description>

      <title>Localized quasiparticles in a fluxonium with quasi-two-dimensional amorphous kinetic inductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered superconducting materials with high kinetic inductance are an important resource to generate nonlinearity in quantum circuits and create high-impedance environments. In thin films fabricated from these materials, the combination of disorder and the low effective dimensionality leads to increased order parameter fluctuations and enhanced kinetic inductance values. Among the challenges of harnessing these compounds in coherent devices are their proximity to the superconductor-insulator phase transition, the presence of broken Cooper pairs, and the two-level systems located in the disordered structure. In this work, we fabricate tungsten silicide wires from quasi-two-dimensional films with one spatial dimension smaller than the superconducting coherence length and embed them into microwave resonators and fluxonium qubits, where the kinetic inductance provides the inductive part of the circuits. We study the dependence of loss on the frequency, disorder, and geometry of the device, and find that the loss increases with the level of disorder and is dominated by the localized quasiparticles trapped in the spatial variations of the superconducting gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00835v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motzkin chain is a model of nearest-neighbor interacting quantum $s=1$ spins with open boundary conditions. It is known that it has a unique ground state which can be viewed as a sum of Motzkin paths. We consider the case of periodic boundary conditions and provide several conjectures about structure of the ground state space and symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that the ground state is degenerate and independent states distinguished by eigenvalues of the third component of total spin operator. Each of these states can be described as a sum of paths, similar to the Motzkin paths. Moreover, there exist two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at these states. We conjecture also that these operators generate the Lie algebra of $C$-type of the rank equal to the number of sites. The symmetry algebra of the Hamiltonian is actually wider, and extended, besides the cyclic shift operator, by a central element contained in the third component of total spin operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in quantum many-body systems underscores the importance of quantum work, which differs from its classical counterpart due to its statistical nature. Recent studies have shown that quantum work can serve as an effective indicator of quantum phase transitions in systems subjected to sudden quenches. However, the potential of quantum work to identify thermal phase transitions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine several types of thermal phase transitions in a sudden-quench hard-core boson model, including Ising, three-state Potts, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Through finite-size scaling analysis, we conclude that work statistics can also characterize the critical behaviors of thermal phase transitions in generic many-body systems. Our investigation paves the way for applying work statistics to characterize critical behavior in many-body systems, with implications that may extend to broader contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An introduction to Bose-Einstein condensation and the $\lambda$-transition is given. Results of quantum loop Monte Carlo simulations are presented for interacting Lennard-Jones helium-4. The optimum condensation fraction is found by minimizing the constrained free energy. The results show that approaching the transition the growth of pure position permutation loops and the consequent divergence of the heat capacity are enabled by the suppression of condensation and consequently of superfluidity. Condensation and superfluidity emerge at the peak of the heat capacity due to mixed position permutation chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the properties of magnons in erbium oxide, a noncollinear antiferromagnet, from an effective single-ion Hamiltonian, including exchange and long-range dipolar interactions. We parametrize the crystal field splitting of Er$_2$O$_3$ using Steven's operators and obtain the effective symmetry-dependent exchange constants between different erbium ions quenched by the crystal field at different symmetry sites. We apply the Holstein-Primakoff transformation to the noncollinear spin system and employ paraunitary diagonalization for the effective spin Hamiltonian. The addition of the dipolar interaction to the exchange magnon dispersion changes the magnon bands drastically. The long-range nature of the dipolar interaction provides challenges to convergence, however we find that the averaged and normalized difference in the magnon dispersion is less than an averaged factor of $10^{-6}$ if the dipolar interaction is included out to the fortieth nearest neighbor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a typical finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, estimators for simple static observables such as specific heat and magnetization are known. With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operation of superconducting qubits requires a sensitive readout circuit at cryogenic temperatures, driving the demand for cryogenic non-reciprocal microwave components such as circulators. However, evaluating these components at low temperatures presents significant challenges for companies and institutions without specialized measurement systems. In the development of such cryogenic non-reciprocal components, the temperature dependence of ferrite's magnetic properties is the most critical factor. Therefore, an evaluation technique for accurately assessing these properties at cryogenic temperatures is essential.
  In this study, we develop a measurement method to characterize low-loss ferrite materials over a temperature range of 300 K to 2 K. The use of the circularly polarized resonance mode (TE11n) enables the direct estimation of circular complex permeability and the determination of key material parameters, including saturation magnetization and damping constant - both essential for assessing the performance of ferrite materials in circulator applications. Without the need for device fabrication, we demonstrate that single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) can effectively function as a circulator down to 2 K. This approach offers a promising pathway for the development of cryogenic circulators.</description>

      <title>Through the Looking-Glass, and What AdS Found There: quantum particle production with a Whittaker spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity-inverted anti-de Sitter space -- ``flipped AdS'' -- is studied through the accelerating boundary correspondence of a moving mirror trajectory. The particle production exhibits positive energy flux and a finite total energy (both unlike AdS). The particle spectrum is of Whittaker form, with some similarities to a Planck thermal spectrum. We also derive the corresponding spacetime metric, with similarities to regular de Sitter space, but exhibiting a tower of repeated causal regions with horizons.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger model from Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Atomic structure analysis of PL5 in silicon carbide with single-spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divacancy (VV) spin defects in 4H polytype of silicon carbide (4H-SiC) are emerging candidates for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Among these defects, PL5 and PL6 stand out due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this study, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5-6 at single-defect level, conclusively demonstrating that PL5-6 are not associated with stacking faults. Further investigation of PL5 through single-spin ODMR spectroscopy allows us to determine its six spatial orientations, as well as to measure the orientation of its transverse anisotropy spin splitting (E) and the statistical distribution of hyperfine splitting. These results and ab initio calculations suggest that PL5 should be VsiVc(hk) divacancy coupled with a nearby antisite atom (VVA). The structure resolution of PL5 starts the first step toward its controllable fabrication, paving the way for various applications.</description>

      <title>Functional Understanding Of Quantum Technology Is Essential To The Ethical Debate About Its Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the innovative potential of quantum technologies comes into focus, so too does the urgent need to address their ethical implications. While many voices highlight the importance of ethical engagement, less attention has been paid to the conditions that make such engagement possible. In this article, I argue that technological understanding is a foundational capacity for meaningful ethical reflection on emerging technology like quantum technologies. Drawing on De Jong &amp; De Haro's account of technological understanding (2025a; 2025b), I clarify what such understanding entails and how it enables ethical enquiry. I contend that ethical assessment, first and foremost, requires an understanding of what quantum technologies can do - their functional capacities and, by extension, their potential applications. Current efforts to build engagement capacities among broader audiences - within and beyond academic contexts - tend, however, to focus on explaining the underlying quantum mechanics. Instead, I advocate a shift from a physics-first to a functions-first approach: fostering an understanding of quantum technologies' capabilities as the basis for ethical reflection. Presenting technological understanding as an epistemic requirement for meaningful ethical engagement may appear to raise the bar for participation. However, by decoupling functional understanding from technical expertise, this condition becomes attainable for a broader group, contributing not only to a well-informed but also to a more inclusive ethical debate.</description>

      <title>Efficient Formal Verification of Quantum Error Correcting Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is fundamental for suppressing noise in quantum hardware and enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We define an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC programs and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of 14 verified stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>Topological laser in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with artificial gauge flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological lasers, known for their robustness and unique features originating from nontrivial topology, have recently become a focal point of research in photonics. In this work, we propose a topological laser based on two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattices as induced by artificial gauge flux insertion. The underlying effect, called the topological Wannier cycles, is characterized by topological local modes with continuously tunable frequency and orbital angular momentum emerging in two photonic band gaps. These topological local modes enable single-mode large-area lasing in each photonic band gap with both topological robustness and exceptional tunability in frequency and OAM properties, setting a notable contrast with previous topological lasers. We further discuss both localized and extended artificial gauge flux insertion and compare their properties. We find that extended gauge flux achieves significantly higher laser output intensity and larger single-mode area under laser-gain conditions, outperforming the local gauge flux configuration in both output intensity and resilience against disorders. We also elucidate the precise mechanisms by which nonlinear gain and gauge flux govern the photon dynamics in various regimes. These results provide crucial theoretical insights for OAM control in topological lasers and pave the way for advancements in high precision engineering of lasers and optical systems.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e physics has transcended spatial dimensions, extending into synthetic domains and enabling novel quantum phenomena. We propose a theoretical model for a two-dimensional (2D) Moir\'e time crystal formed by ultracold atoms, induced by periodic perturbations applied to a non-lattice trap. Our analysis reveals the emergence of regional superfluid states exhibiting moir\'e-scale quantum coherence across temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal domains. This work provides fundamental insights into temporal moir\'e phenomena and presents an alternative pathway to engineer spatial moir\'e phases without requiring twisted multilayer lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the interaction quench dynamics of two atoms with different masses and subject to different trapping potentials. Notably, under such anisotropic conditions, the nonequilibrium dynamics can lead to the occupation of molecular excited states. We consider cases of quenching from attractive to repulsive interaction and vice versa, analyzing the impact of the pre- and postquench states. The analysis of overlap integrals for the both states reveals a significant contribution from the molecular excited state. Moreover, the overlap with the prequench states might serve as an indicator of when this excited state may emerge. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum for the lowest levels in the both isotropic and anisotropic harmonic traps. Throughout our study, we use a Gaussian-shaped finite-range interaction potential.</description>

Abstract: We compute the second-order correction to the electronic dispersion relation of a free electron gas interacting with an effective electron-dislocation potential, derived from a modern quantized theory of dislocations. Our results demonstrate that dislocation patterning induces anisotropic flat bands in the electronic dispersion under specific strain fields and directions, referred to as ``magic'' parameters. These flat bands acquire non-zero curvature as the strain or direction deviates from these magic parameters.</description>

      <title>Spectral delineation of Markov Generators: Classical vs Quantum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated theorem of Perron and Frobenius implies that spectra of classical Markov operators, represented by stochastic matrices, are restricted to the unit disk. This property holds also for spectra of quantum stochastic maps (quantum channels), which describe quantum Markovian evolution in discrete time. Moreover, the spectra of stochastic $N \times N$ matrices are additionally restricted to a subset of the unit disk, called Karpelevi\u{c} region, the shape of which depends on $N$. We address the question of whether the spectra of generators, which induce Markovian evolution in continuous time, can be bound in a similar way. We propose a rescaling that allows us to answer this question affirmatively. The eigenvalues of the rescaled classical generators are confined to the modified Karpelevi\u{c} regions, whereas the eigenvalues of the rescaled quantum generators fill the entire unit disk.</description>

      <title>A Rate-Distortion Perspective on Quantum State Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a rate-distortion version of the quantum state redistribution task, where the error of the decoded state is judged via an additive distortion measure; it thus constitutes a quantum generalisation of the classical Wyner-Ziv problem. The quantum source is described by a tripartite pure state shared between Alice ($A$, encoder), Bob ($B$, decoder) and a reference ($R$). Both Alice and Bob are required to output a system ($\widetilde{A}$ and $\widetilde{B}$, respectively), and the distortion measure is encoded in an observable on $\widetilde{A}\widetilde{B}R$.
  It includes as special cases most quantum rate-distortion problems considered in the past, and in particular quantum data compression with the fidelity measured per copy; furthermore, it generalises the well-known state merging and quantum state redistribution tasks for a pure state source, with per-copy fidelity, and a variant recently considered by us, where the source is an ensemble of pure states [ZBK &amp; AW, Proc. ISIT 2020, pp. 1858-1863 and ZBK, PhD thesis, UAB 2020, arXiv:2012.14143].
  We derive a single-letter formula for the rate-distortion function of compression schemes assisted by free entanglement. A peculiarity of the formula is that in general it requires optimisation over an unbounded auxiliary register, so the rate-distortion function is not readily computable from our result, and there is a continuity issue at zero distortion. However, we show how to overcome these difficulties in certain situations.</description>

      <title>The coherent measurement cost of coherence distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum coherence -- an indispensable resource for quantum technologies -- is known to be distillable from a noisy form using operations that cannot create it. However, distillation exacts a hidden coherent measurement cost, which has not previously been examined. We devise the target effect construction to characterize this cost through detailed conditions on the coherence-measuring structure necessary in any process realizing exact (maximal or non-maximal) or approximate distillation. As a corollary, we lower-bound the requisite measurement coherence, as quantified by operationally-relevant measures. We then consider the asymptotic limit of distilling from many copies of a given noisy coherent state, where we offer rigorous arguments to support the conjecture that the (necessary and sufficient) coherent measurement cost scales extensively in the number of copies. We also show that this cost is no smaller than the coherence of measurements saturating the scaling law in the generalized quantum Stein's lemma. Our results and conjectures apply to any task whereof coherence distillation is an incidental outcome (e.g., incoherent randomness extraction). But if pure coherence is the only desired outcome, our conjectures would have the cautionary implication that the measurement cost is often higher than the distilled yield, in which case coherence should rather be prepared afresh than distilled from a noisy input.</description>

      <title>COGNAC: Circuit Optimization via Gradients and Noise-Aware Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present COGNAC, a novel strategy for compiling quantum circuits based on numerical optimization algorithms from scientific computing. Observing that shorter-duration "partially entangling" gates tend to be less noisy than the typical "maximally entangling" gates, we use a simple and versatile noise model to construct a differentiable cost function. Standard gradient-based optimization algorithms running on a GPU can then quickly converge to a local optimum that closely approximates the target unitary. By reducing rotation angles to zero, COGNAC removes gates from a circuit, producing smaller quantum circuits. We have implemented this technique as a general-purpose Qiskit compiler plugin and compared performance with state-of-the-art optimizers on a variety of standard benchmarks. Testing our compiled circuits on superconducting quantum hardware, we find that COGNAC's optimizations produce circuits that are substantially less noisy than those produced by existing optimizers. These runtime performance gains come without a major compile-time cost, as COGNAC's parallelism allows it to retain a competitive optimization speed.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Esscher Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Esscher Transform is a tool of broad utility in various domains of applied probability. It provides the solution to a constrained minimum relative entropy optimization problem. In this work, we study the generalization of the Esscher Transform to the quantum setting. We examine a relative entropy minimization problem for a quantum density operator, potentially of wide relevance in quantum information theory. The resulting solution form motivates us to define the \textit{quantum} Esscher Transform, which subsumes the classical Esscher Transform as a special case. Envisioning potential applications of the quantum Esscher Transform, we also discuss its implementation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. Our algorithm is based on the modern techniques of block-encoding and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). We show that given block-encoded inputs, our algorithm outputs a subnormalized block-encoding of the quantum Esscher transform within accuracy $\epsilon$ in $\tilde O(\kappa d \log^2 1/\epsilon)$ queries to the inputs, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the input density operator and $d$ is the number of constraints.</description>

      <title>$\zeta$-QVAE: A Quantum Variational Autoencoder utilizing Regularized Mixed-state Latent Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in quantum computing is its application to large real-world datasets due to scarce quantum hardware resources. One approach to enabling tractable quantum models for such datasets involves finding low-dimensional representations that preserve essential information for downstream analysis. In classical machine learning, variational autoencoders (VAEs) facilitate efficient data compression, representation learning for subsequent tasks, and novel data generation. However, no quantum model has been proposed that captures these features for direct application to quantum data on quantum computers. Some existing quantum models for data compression lack regularization of latent representations. Others are hybrid models with only some internal quantum components, impeding direct training on quantum data. To address this, we present a fully quantum framework, $\zeta$-QVAE, which encompasses all the capabilities of classical VAEs and can be directly applied to map both classical and quantum data to a lower-dimensional space, while effectively reconstructing much of the original state from it. Our model utilizes regularized mixed states to attain optimal latent representations. It accommodates various divergences for reconstruction and regularization. Furthermore, by accommodating mixed states at every stage, it can utilize the full-data density matrix and allow for a training objective defined on probabilistic mixtures of input data. Doing so, in turn, makes efficient optimization possible and has potential implications for private and federated learning. In addition to exploring the theoretical properties of $\zeta$-QVAE, we demonstrate its performance on genomics and synthetic data. Our results indicate that $\zeta$-QVAE learns representations that better utilize the capacity of the latent space and exhibits similar or better performance compared to matched classical models.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithms for Differential Equations on a Noisy Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of differential equations (DEs) in science and engineering is of paramount importance, as they provide the mathematical framework for a multitude of natural phenomena. Since quantum computers promise significant advantages over classical computers, quantum algorithms for the solution of DEs have received a lot of attention. Particularly interesting are algorithms that offer advantages in the current noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era, characterized by small and error-prone systems. We consider a framework of variational quantum algorithms, quantum circuit learning (QCL), in conjunction with derivation methods, in particular the parameter shift rule, to solve DEs. As these algorithms were specifically designed for NISQ computers, we analyze their applicability on NISQ devices by implementing QCL on an IBM quantum computer. Our analysis of QCL without the parameter shift rule shows that we can successfully learn different functions with three-qubit circuits. However, the hardware errors accumulate with increasing number of qubits and thus only a fraction of the qubits available on the current quantum systems can be effectively used. We further show that it is possible to determine derivatives of the learned functions using the parameter shift rule on the IBM hardware. The parameter shift rule results in higher errors which limits its execution to low-order derivatives. Despite these limitations, we solve a first-order DE on the IBM quantum computer. We further explore the advantages of using multiple qubits in QCL by learning different functions simultaneously and demonstrate the solution of a coupled differential equation on a simulator.</description>

      <title>Wave Function Collapse, Lorentz Invariance, and the Third Postulate of Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The changes that quantum states undergo during measurement are both probabilistic and nonlocal. These two characteristics complement one another to insure compatibility with relativity and maintain conservation laws. Nonlocal entanglement relations provide a means to enforce conservation laws in a probabilistic theory, while the probabilistic nature of nonlocal effects prevents the superluminal transmission of information. In order to explain these measurement-induced changes in terms of fundamental physical processes it is necessary to take these two key characteristics into account. One way to do this is to modify the Schroedinger equation by adding stochastic, nonlinear terms. A number of such proposals have been made over the past few decades. A recently proposed equation based on the assumption that wave function collapse is induced by a sequence of correlating interactions of the kind that constitute measurements has been shown to maintain strict adherence to conservation laws in individual instances, and has also eliminated the need to introduce any new, ad hoc physical constants. 
  In this work it is shown that the stochastic modification to the Schroedinger equation is Lorentz invariant. It is further argued that the additional spacetime structure that it requires provides a way to implement the assumption that spacelike-separated operators (and measurements) commute, and that this assumption of local commutativity should be regarded as a third postulate of relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the main theoretical support of quantum metrology, quantum parameter estimation must follow the steps of quantum metrology towards the applied science and industry. Hence, optimal scheme design will soon be a crucial and core task for quantum parameter estimation. To efficiently accomplish this task, software packages aimed at computer-aided design are in high demand. In response to this need, we hereby introduce QuanEstimation.jl, an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed hybrid-language (Python-Julia) package QuanEstimation [Phys. Rev. Res. 4 (4) (2022) 043057]. Utilizing this framework, the scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises exist.</description>

Abstract: High-rate quantum error correcting codes mitigate the imposing scale of fault-tolerant quantum computers but require efficient generation of non-local, many-body entanglement. We provide a linear-optical architecture with these properties, compatible with arbitrary codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits on generic lattices, and featuring a natural way to leverage physical noise bias. Simulations of hyperbolic surface codes and bivariate bicycle codes, promising families of quantum low-density parity-check codes, reveal a threshold comparable to the 2D surface code with substantially better encoding rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in quantum machine learning is increasingly growing due to its potential to offer more efficient solutions for problems that are difficult to tackle with classical methods. In this context, the research work presented here focuses on the use of quantum machine learning techniques for image classification tasks. We exploit a quantum extreme learning machine by taking advantage of its rich feature map provided by the quantum reservoir substrate. We systematically analyse different phases of the quantum extreme learning machine process, from the dataset preparation to the image final classification. In particular, we have tested different encodings, together with Principal Component Analysis, the use of Auto-Encoders, as well as the dynamics of the model through the use of different Hamiltonians for the quantum reservoir. Our results show that the introduction of a quantum reservoir systematically improves the accuracy of the classifier. Additionally, while different encodings can lead to significantly different performances, Hamiltonians with varying degrees of connectivity exhibit the same discrimination rate, provided they are interacting.</description>

Abstract: I present an accreditation protocol (a variety of quantum verification) where error is assumed to be adversarial (in contrast to the assumption error is implemented by identical CPTP maps used in previous accreditation protocols) - albeit slightly modified to reflect physically motivated error assumptions. This is achieved by upgrading a pre-existing accreditation protocol (from [S. Ferracin et al. Phys. Rev. A 104, 042603 (2021)]) to function correctly in the face of adversarial error, with no diminution in efficiency or suitability for near-term usage.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Classical Algorithm for Simulating Short Time 2D Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient classical simulation of the Schrodinger equation is central to quantum mechanics, as it is crucial for exploring complex natural phenomena and understanding the fundamental distinctions between classical and quantum computation. Although simulating general quantum dynamics is BQP-complete, tensor networks allow efficient simulation of short-time evolution in 1D systems. However, extending these methods to higher dimensions becomes significantly challenging when the area law is violated. In this work, we tackle this challenge by introducing an efficient classical algorithm for simulating short-time dynamics in 2D quantum systems, utilizing cluster expansion and shallow quantum circuit simulation. Our algorithm has wide-ranging applications, including an efficient dequantization method for estimating quantum eigenvalues and eigenstates, simulating superconducting quantum computers, dequantizing quantum variational algorithms, and simulating constant-gap adiabatic quantum evolution. Our results reveal the inherent simplicity in the complexity of short-time 2D quantum dynamics and highlight the limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, particularly those confined to 2D topological structures. This work advances our understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation and the criteria for achieving quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum transduction is essential for the future hybrid quantum networks, connecting devices across different spectral ranges. In this regard, molecular modulation in hollow-core fibers has proven to be exceptional for efficient and tunable frequency conversion of arbitrary light fields down to the single-photon limit. However, insights on this conversion method for quantum light have remained elusive beyond standard semiclassical models. In this Letter, we employ a quantum Hamiltonian framework to characterize the behavior of entanglement during molecular modulation, while describing the quantum dynamics of both molecules and photons in agreement with recent experiments. In particular, apart from obtaining analytical expressions for the final opto-molecular states, our model predicts a close correlation between the evolution of the average photon numbers and the transfer of entanglement between the interacting parties. These results will contribute to the development of new fiber-based strategies to tackle the challenges associated with the upcoming generation of lightwave quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Quantum Phase Transition in Open Systems: System-Bath Interaction at the Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of a second-order quantum phase transition in the Dicke model is a well-established feature. On the contrary, a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding open system, particularly in the proximity of the critical point, remains elusive. When approaching the critical point, the system inevitably enters first the system-bath ultrastrong coupling regime and finally the deepstrong coupling regime, causing the failure of usual approximations adopted to describe open quantum systems. We study the interaction of the Dicke model with bosonic bath fields in the absence of additional approximations, which usually relies on the weakness of the system-bath coupling. We find that the critical point is not affected by the interaction with the environment. Moreover, the interaction with the environment is not able to affect the system ground-state condensates in the superradiant phase, whereas the bath fields are infected by the system and acquire macroscopic occupations. The obtained reflection spectra display lineshapes which become increasingly asymmetric, both in the normal and superradiant phases, when approaching the critical point.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and analyze an active steering protocol designed to target multipartite entangled states. The protocol involves multiple qubits subjected to weak Bell pair measurements with active feedback, where the feedback operations are optimized to maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. Our scheme efficiently reaches a genuinely entangled one-parameter state manifold. Numerical simulations for systems with up to 22 qubits suggest that the protocol is scalable and allows high multipartite entanglement across the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the expectation that relativistic symmetries might acquire quantum features in Quantum Gravity, we take the first steps towards a theory of ''Doubly'' Quantum Mechanics, a modification of Quantum Mechanics in which the geometrical configurations of physical systems, measurement apparata, and reference frame transformations are themselves quantized and described by ''geometry'' states in a Hilbert space. We develop the formalism for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ measurements by promoting the group of spatial rotations $SU(2)$ to the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ and generalizing the axioms of Quantum Theory in a covariant way. As a consequence of our axioms, the notion of probability becomes a self-adjoint operator acting on the Hilbert space of geometry states, hence acquiring novel non-classical features. After introducing a suitable class of semi-classical geometry states, which describe near-to-classical geometrical configurations of physical systems, we find that probability measurements are affected, in these configurations, by intrinsic uncertainties stemming from the quantum properties of $SU_q(2)$. This feature translates into an unavoidable fuzziness for observers attempting to align their reference frames by exchanging qubits, even when the number of exchanged qubits approaches infinity, contrary to the standard $SU(2)$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the Liouvillian exceptional point manifolds (LEPMs) of a two-qubit open system, where one qubit is coupled to a dissipative polarization bath. Exploiting a Z_2 symmetry, we block-diagonalize the Liouvillian and show that one symmetry block yields two planar LEPMs while the other one exhibits a more intricate, multi-sheet topology. The intersection curves of these manifolds provide a phase diagram for effective Zeno transitions at small dissipation. These results are consistent with a perturbative extrapolation from the strong Zeno regime. Interestingly, we find that the fastest relaxation to the non-equilibrium steady state occurs on LEPMs associated with the transition to the effective Zeno regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian energy spectra under periodic boundary conditions can form closed loops in the complex energy plane, a phenomenon known as point gap topology. In this paper, we investigate the self-intersection points of such non-Hermitian energy spectra and reveal their geometric origins. We rigorously demonstrate that these self-intersection points result from the intersection of the auxiliary generalized Brillouin zone and the Brillouin zone in one-band systems, as confirmed by an extended Hatano-Nelson model. This finding is further generalized to multi-band systems, illustrated through a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Moreover, we address multiple self-intersection points and derive the geometric conditions for general n-fold self-intersection points. Our results enhance the fundamental understanding of generic non-Hermitian quantum systems and provide theoretical support for further experimental investigations of energy self-intersection points.</description>

      <title>Alternative Framework to Quantize Fermionic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variational framework is developed here to quantize fermionic fields based on the extended stationary action principle. From the first principle, we successfully derive the well-known Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields - an equation typically introduced as a postulate in standard canonical quantization. The derivation is accomplished through three key contributions. At the conceptual level, the classical stationary action principle is extended to include a correction term based on the relative entropy arising from field fluctuations. Then, an extended canonical transformation for fermionic fields is formulated that allows us to obtain the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a form consistent with the Floreanini-Jackiw representation; Third, necessary functional calculus with Grassmann-valued field variables is developed for the variation procedure. The quantized Hamiltonian is verified to generate the Poincar\'{e} algebra, thus satisfying the symmetry requirements of special relativity. We also show that the framework can be applied to develop theories of interaction between fermionic fields and other external fields such as electromagnetic fields, non-Abelian gauge fields, or another fermionic field. These results further establish that the present variational framework is a novel alternative to derive quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Cooperative squeezing of internal and collective spins in an atomic ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the standard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been achieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling the multi-level internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate combined internal and collective spin squeezing in a hot atomic ensemble with $\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing the degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.</description>

      <title>Exploring Tensor Network Algorithms as a Quantum-Inspired Method for Quantum Extreme Learning Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) has emerged as a promising hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) method that leverages the complex dynamics of quantum systems and classical machine learning models. Motivated by the development of this new QML method, we explore how quantum-inspired techniques like tensor networks (TNs), specifically the Time Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) with Matrix Product State (MPS), can be used for the QELM algorithm. To demonstrate the utility of our quantum-inspired method, we performed numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset and compared the performance of our quantum-inspired QELM with different classical machine learning (ML) methods. The results reveal that high-quality embeddings can be generated by performing the time-evolution of MPS system consisting of one-dimensional chain of Rydberg atoms. This quantum-inspired method is highly scalable, enabling the simulation of 100 qubits with a low classical computing overhead. Finally, this study also underscores the potential of tensor networks as quantum-inspired algorithms to enhance the capability of quantum machine learning algorithms to study datasets with large numbers of features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional broadband quantum memory significantly expands quantum information processing capabilities, but the memory efficiency becomes insufficient when extended to high dimensions. We demonstrate an efficient quantum memory for hyper-dimensional photons encoded with orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin angular momentum (SAM). OAM information is encoded from 5 to +5, combined with spin angular momentum encoding, enabling up to 22 dimensions. To ensure high memory efficiency, an artificial intelligence algorithm, a modified Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm using Chebyshev sampling, is developed to obtain a perfect signal-control waveform matching. Memory efficiency is experimentally achieved at 92% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 91% for information dimension of 6 and 80% for dimensional number to 22. The fidelity is achieved up to 99% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 96% for OAM information and 97% for SAM one, and 92% for whole hyper-dimensional signal, which is far beyond no-cloning limitation. Our results demonstrate superior performance and potential applications in high-dimensional quantum information processing. This achievement provides a crucial foundation for future quantum communication and quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving industrial quantum advantage is unlikely without the use of quantum error correction (QEC). Other QEC codes beyond surface code are being experimentally studied, such as color codes and quantum Low-Density Parity Check (qLDPC) codes, that could benefit from new quantum processing unit (QPU) architectures. Star-topology offers effective all-to-all connectivity in comparison to the square-grid topology and thus enables more hardware efficient implementation of some QEC codes. We encode two logical qubits in a star-topology superconducting QPU using the [[4,2,2]] code and characterize the logical states with the classical shadow framework. Logical life-time and logical error rate are measured over repeated quantum error detection cycles for various logical states including a logical Bell state. We measure logical state fidelities above 96 % for every cardinal logical state, find logical life-times above the best physical element, and logical error-per-cycle values ranging from from 0.25(2) % to 0.91(3) %. The presented QPU configuration can be used to enable qubit-count efficient QEC codes via the high connectivity in future devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum process characterization is a fundamental task in quantum information processing, yet conventional methods, such as quantum process tomography, require prohibitive resources and lack scalability. Here, we introduce an efficient quantum process learning method specifically designed for short-time Hamiltonian dynamics. Our approach reconstructs an equivalent quantum circuit representation from measurement data of unknown Hamiltonian evolution without requiring additional assumptions and achieves polynomial sample and computational efficiency. Our results have broad applications in various directions. We demonstrate applications in quantum machine learning, where our protocol enables efficient training of variational quantum neural networks by directly learning unitary transformations. Additionally, it facilitates the prediction of quantum expectation values with provable efficiency and provides a robust framework for verifying quantum computations and benchmarking realistic noisy quantum hardware. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for practical quantum dynamics learning, paving the way for scalable quantum process characterization in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of photons in a cryogenic cavity, made by cryo-cooled mirrors surrounded by a room temperature environment. We model such a system as a multimode cavity coupled to two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. Using a Lindblad master equation approach, we derive the photon distribution and the statistical properties of the cavity modes, finding an overall non-thermal state described by a mode-dependent effective temperature. We also calculate the dissipation rates arising from the interaction of the cavity field with the external environment and the mirrors, relating such rates to measurable macroscopic quantities. These results provide a simple theory to calculate the dissipative properties and the effective temperature of a cavity coupled to different thermal reservoirs, offering potential pathways for engineering dissipations and photon statistics in cavity settings.</description>

      <title>Online Gaussian elimination for quantum LDPC decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoders for quantum LDPC codes generally rely on solving a parity-check equation with Gaussian elimination, with the generalised union-find decoder performing this repeatedly on growing clusters. We present an online variant of the Gaussian elimination algorithm which maintains an LUP decomposition in order to process only new rows and columns as they are added to a system of equations. This is equivalent to performing Gaussian elimination once on the final system of equations, in contrast to the multiple rounds of Gaussian elimination employed by the generalised union-find decoder. It thus significantly reduces the number of operations performed by the decoder. We consider the generalised union-find decoder as an example use case and present a complexity analysis demonstrating that both variants take time cubic in the number of qubits in the general case, but that the number of operations performed by the online variant is lower by an amount which itself scales cubically. This analysis is also extended to the regime of 'well-behaved' codes in which the number of growth iterations required is bounded logarithmically in error weight. Finally, we show empirically that our online variant outperforms the original offline decoder in average-case time complexity on codes with sparser parity-check matrices or greater covering radius.</description>

      <title>Open fermionic string theory in a non commutative target phase-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a free open fermionic string theory in a non-commutative target phase-space as well as for the space part and the momentum part. The modified commutation relations in terms of oscillating modes are derived. Modified super-Virasoro algebras are obtained in the Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz sectors where new anomaly terms appears. The non-commutativity affect the Lorentz covariance and the mass operator is no more diagonal in the usual Fock space. A redefinition of the Fock space is proposed to diagonalize the non-commutativity parameters matrices to obtain a diagonalized mass operator. Some restrictions on the non commutativity parameters are imposed to eliminate the Virasoro algerbra anomaly terms due to the non-commutativity, where at the same time the usual mass spectrum is obtained. The GSO projection is now possible where a space-time supersymmetry is obtained. More restrictions on the non-commutativity parameters zero modes are imposed and the Lorentz covariance is restored.</description>

      <title>Embezzlement of entanglement, quantum fields, and the classification of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum information theoretic task of embezzlement of entanglement in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Given a shared entangled resource state, this task asks to produce arbitrary entangled states using local operations without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. We quantify the performance of a given resource state by the worst-case error. States for which the latter vanishes are 'embezzling states' as they allow to embezzle arbitrary entangled states with arbitrarily small error. The best and worst performance among all states defines two algebraic invariants for von Neumann algebras. The first invariant takes only two values. Either it vanishes and embezzling states exist, which can only happen in type III, or no state allows for nontrivial embezzlement. In the case of factors not of finite type I, the second invariant equals the diameter of the state space. This provides a quantitative operational interpretation of Connes' classification of type III factors within quantum information theory. Type III$_1$ factors are 'universal embezzlers' where every state is embezzling. Our findings have implications for relativistic quantum field theory, where type III algebras naturally appear. For instance, they explain the maximal violation of Bell inequalities in the vacuum. Our results follow from a one-to-one correspondence between embezzling states and invariant probability measures on the flow of weights. We also establish that universally embezzling ITPFI factors are of type III$_1$ by elementary arguments.</description>

      <title>Universal distributions of overlaps from generic dynamics in quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of overlaps with the computational basis of a quantum state generated under generic quantum many-body chaotic dynamics, without conserved quantities, for a finite time $t$. We argue that, scaling time logarithmically with the system size $t \propto \log L$, the overlap distribution converges to a universal form in the thermodynamic limit, forming a one-parameter family that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. The form of the overlap distribution only depends on the spatial dimensionality and, remarkably, on the boundary conditions. This picture is justified in general by a mapping to Ginibre ensemble of random matrices and corroborated by the exact solution of a random quantum circuit. Our results derive from an analysis of arbitrary overlap moments, enabling the reconstruction of the distribution. Our predictions also apply to Floquet circuits, i.e., in the presence of mild quenched disorder. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a self-correcting GKP qubit can be realized with a high-impedance LC circuit coupled to a resistor and a Josephson junction via a controllable switch. When activating the switch in a particular stepwise pattern, the resonator relaxes into a subspace of GKP states that encode a protected qubit. Under continued operation, the resistor dissipatively error-corrects the qubit against bit flips and decoherence by absorbing noise-induced entropy. We show that this leads to an exponential enhancement of coherence time (T1 and T2), even in the presence of extrinsic noise, imperfect control, and device parameter variations. We show the qubit supports exponentially robust single-qubit Clifford gates, implemented via appropriate control of the switch, and readout/initialization via supercurrent measurement. The qubit's self-correcting properties allows it to operate at ~1K temperatures and resonator Q factors down to ~1000 for realistic parameters, and make it amenable to parallel control through global control signals. We discuss how the effects of quasiparticle poisoning -- potentially, though not necessarily, a limiting factor -- might be mitigated. We finally demonstrate that a related device supports a self-correcting magic T gate.</description>

      <title>Translation symmetry restoration under random unitary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The finite parts of a large, locally interacting many-body system prepared out-of-equilibrium eventually equilibrate. Characterising the underlying mechanisms of this process and its timescales, however, is particularly hard as it requires to decouple universal features from observable-specific ones. Recently, new insight came by studying how certain symmetries of the dynamics that are broken by the initial state are restored at the level of the reduced state of a given subsystem. This provides a high level, observable-independent probe. Until now this idea has been applied to the restoration of internal symmetries, e.g. U(1) symmetries related to charge conservation. Here we show that that the same logic can be applied to the restoration of space-time symmetries, and hence can be used to characterise the relaxation of fully generic systems. We illustrate this idea by considering the paradigmatic example of "generic" many-body dynamics, i.e. a local random unitary circuit, where our method leads to exact results. We show that the restoration of translation symmetry in these systems only happens on time-scales proportional to the subsystem's volume. In fact, for large enough subsystems the time of symmetry restoration becomes initial-state independent (as long as the latter breaks the symmetry at time zero) and coincides with the thermalisation time. For intermediate subsystems, however, one can observe the so-called "quantum Mpemba effect", where the state of the system restores a symmetry faster if it is initially more asymmetric. We provide the first exact characterisation of this effect in a non-integrable system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a charged confining holographic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a recently constructed charged confining holographic background. The confining background corresponds to the charged soliton, which is a solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. The solution has a compact spacelike direction with a Wilson line on a circle and asymptotes to $AdS_5$ with a planar boundary. For the classical case, we analyze the chaos using the power spectrum, Poincar\'{e} sections, and Lyapunov exponents, finding that both energy and charge play constructive effects on enhancing the chaotic nature of the system. We similarly analyze quantum chaos using the distribution of the spectrum's level-spacing and out-of-time-ordered correlators and thoroughly investigate the effects of charge and energy. A gradual transition from a chaotic to an integrable regime is obtained as the energy and charge increase from lower to higher values, with charge playing a subdominant role.</description>

      <title>EDA-Q: Electronic Design Automation for Superconducting Quantum Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) plays a crucial role in classical chip design and significantly influences the development of quantum chip design. However, traditional EDA tools cannot be directly applied to quantum chip design due to vast differences compared to the classical realm. Several EDA products tailored for quantum chip design currently exist, yet they only cover partial stages of the quantum chip design process instead of offering a fully comprehensive solution. Additionally, they often encounter issues such as limited automation, steep learning curves, challenges in integrating with actual fabrication processes, and difficulties in expanding functionality. To address these issues, we developed a full-stack EDA tool specifically for quantum chip design, called EDA-Q. The design workflow incorporates functionalities present in existing quantum EDA tools while supplementing critical design stages such as device mapping and fabrication process mapping, which users expect. EDA-Q utilizes a unique architecture to achieve exceptional scalability and flexibility. The integrated design mode guarantees algorithm compatibility with different chip components, while employing a specialized interactive processing mode to offer users a straightforward and adaptable command interface. Application examples demonstrate that EDA-Q significantly reduces chip design cycles, enhances automation levels, and decreases the time required for manual intervention. Multiple rounds of testing on the designed chip have validated the effectiveness of EDA-Q in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Observable-manifested correlations in many-body quantum chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distinctions between realistic quantum chaotic systems and random models from the perspective of observable properties, particularly focusing on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Through numerical simulations, we find that for realistic systems, the envelope function of off-diagonal elements of observables exhibits an exponential decay at large $\Delta E$, while for randomized models, it tends to be flat. We demonstrate that the correlations of chaotic eigenstates, originating from the delicate structures of Hamiltonians, play a crucial role in the non-trivial structure of the envelope function. Furthermore, we analyze the numerical results from the perspective of the dynamical group elements in Hamiltonians. Our findings highlight the importance of correlations in physical chaotic systems and provide insights into the deviations from RMT predictions. These understandings offer valuable directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Prospect for measuring work statistics in quantum coherent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents. In stochastic thermodynamics a key object of interest is the statistics of these quantities, but it is notoriously difficult to measure it in general systems. Here we discuss the prospect for measuring work statistics in electronic devices, via a study of a transmon-microcavity system. The microwave cavity acts as a work agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics. Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference. Our work opens a way for measuring work statistics in nontrivial quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent metric from wavelet-transformed quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method of reverse holography by which a bulk metric is shown to arise from locally computable multiscale correlations of a boundary quantum field theory (QFT). The metric is obtained from the Petz-R\'enyi mutual information using as input the correlations computed from the continuous wavelet transform. We show for free massless fermionic and bosonic QFTs that the emerging metric is asymptotically anti-de Sitter space (AdS), and that the parameters fixing the geometry are tunable by changing the chosen wavelet basis. The method is applicable to a variety of boundary QFTs that need not be conformal field theories.</description>
