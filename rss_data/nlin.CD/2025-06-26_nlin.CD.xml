      <title>Escape and transport in chaotic motion of charged particles in a magnetized plasma under the influence of two and three modes of drift waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how two- and three-wave configurations govern particle escape and transport in tokamak edge plasmas. Using a Hamiltonian model derived from drift-wave turbulence, we analyze test particle dynamics through Poincar\'e maps, fractal escape basins, and entropy metrics. Introducing a third wave increases basin entropy, enhancing particle escape rates while reducing basin boundary entropy, indicative of suppressed basin mixing. Escape time analyses reveal resonant scattering disrupts coherent transport pathways, linking fractal absorption patterns to heat load mitigation in divertors. Characteristic transport is also analyzed and regimes transition between anomalous $(\alpha &gt; 1)$ and normal diffusion $(\alpha \approx 1)$, two-wave systems sustain anomalous transport, while the third wave homogenizes fluxes through stochastic scattering. Fractal structures in escape basins and entropy-driven uncertainty quantification suggest strategies to engineer transport properties, balancing chaos and order for optimized confinement.</description>

      <title>Flutter Suppression Enhancement in Coupled Nonlinear Airfoils with Intermittent Mixed Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flutter suppression facilitates the improvement of structural reliability to ensure the flight safety of an aircraft. In this study, we propose a novel strategy for enlarging amplitude death (AD) regime to enhance flutter suppression in two coupled identical airfoils with structural nonlinearity. Specifically, we introduce an intermittent mixed coupling strategy, i.e., a linear combination of intermittent instantaneous coupling and intermittent time-delayed coupling between two airfoils. Numerical simulations are performed to reveal the influence mechanisms of different coupling scenarios on the dynamical behaviors of the coupled airfoil systems. The obtained results indicate that the coupled airfoil systems experience the expected AD behaviors within a certain range of the coupling strength and time-delayed parameters. The continuous mixed coupling favors the onset of AD over a larger parameter set of coupling strength than the continuous purely time-delayed coupling. Moreover, the presence of intermittent interactions can lead to a further enlargement of the AD regions, that is, flutter suppression enhancement. Our findings support the structural design and optimization of an aircraft wing for mitigating the unwanted aeroelastic instability behaviors.</description>

      <title>What is the graph of a dynamical system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some of the basic properties of any dynamical system can be summarized by a graph. The dynamical systems in our theory run from maps like the logistic map to ordinary differential equations to dissipative partial differential equations. Our goal has been to define a meaningful concept of graph of any dynamical system. As a result, we base our definition of ``chain graph'' on ``epsilon-chains'', defining both nodes and edges of the graph in terms of chains. In particular, nodes are often maximal limit sets and there is an edge between two nodes if there is a trajectory whose forward limit set is in one node and its backward limit set is in the other. Our initial goal was to prove that every ``chain graph'' of a dynamical system is, in some sense, connected, and we prove connectedness under mild hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Effective and asymptotic scaling in a one-dimensional billiard problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of power laws that govern the large-time dynamics of a one-dimensional billiard of $N$ point particles is analysed. In the initial state, the resting particles are placed in the positive half-line $x\geqslant 0$ at equal distances. Their masses alternate between two distinct values. The dynamics is initialized by giving the leftmost particle a positive velocity. Due to elastic inter-particle collisions, the whole system gradually comes into motion, filling both right-hand and left-hand half-lines. As shown by [Chakraborti S., Dhar A., Krapivsky P., SciPost Phys., 2022, 13, 074], an inherent feature of such a billiard is the emergence of two different modes: the shock wave that propagates in $x\geqslant 0$ and the splash region in $x&lt;0$. Moreover, the behaviour of the relevant observables is characterized by universal asymptotic power-law dependencies. In view of the finite size of the system and of finite observation times, these dependencies only start to acquire a universal character. To analyse them, we set up molecular dynamics simulations using the concept of effective scaling exponents, familiar in the theory of continuous phase transitions. We present results for the effective exponents that govern the large-time behaviour of the shock-wave front, the number of collisions, the energies and momentum of different modes and analyse their tendency to approach corresponding universal values.</description>

      <title>Followerstopper Revisited: Phase-space Lagrangian Controller for Traffic Decongestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits Followerstopper, a phase-space-based control system that had demonstrated its ability to mitigate emergent traffic jams due to stop-and-go traffic during rush hour in the mixed-autonomy setting. Followerstopper was deployed on an autonomous vehicle. The controller attenuates the emanant traffic waves by regulating its velocity according to the relative distance and velocity of the leader car. While regulating the velocity, the controller also prevents the collision of the ego vehicle with the lead vehicle within the range specified by the controller's design parameter. The controller design is based on a configurable quadratic curve on relative distance-relative velocity phase-space that allows the transition of the regulated velocity from (i) no modification of input, (ii) decelerating to match the leader's velocity (iii) braking to avoid any imminent collision. In this paper, we explore the phase-space properties of Followerstopper and provide a detailed description of a nonlinear control law that regulates the reference input to Followerstopper within the physics-informed boundaries. We also provide a new discussion on the nominal control law that regulates the reference speed to Followerstopper to avoid unrealistic and unsafe acceleration.</description>
