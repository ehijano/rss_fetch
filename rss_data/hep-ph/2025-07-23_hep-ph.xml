      <title>Quantum Scaling in Energy Correlators Beyond the Confinement Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the QCD scaling behavior of the small-angle Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC), focusing on the transition between its perturbative pre-confinement and non-perturbative post-confinement regimes. Applying the light-ray Operator Product Expansion (OPE), we develop a formalism that describes the scaling of the EEC with the input energy $Q$ in the transition and the post-confinement region, where the latter quantum scaling is determined by the $J=5$ DGLAP anomalous dimension. A key result of our work is a novel connection between the light-ray OPE and the dihadron fragmentation function (DFF), where we show that the non-perturbative OPE coefficients correspond to moments of the DFF. This finding establishes a new paradigm for studying hadronization. Our theoretical predictions are validated against Monte Carlo simulations for both $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ collisions, showing excellent agreement. The potential role of the quantum scaling in the precision determination of $\alpha_s$ is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the analysis of the inflationary dynamics in Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity nonminimally coupled to the Standard Model of particle physics. We take the axion-like particle of gravitational origin to be heavy and show that inflation with the Higgs field can be accommodated in this framework.</description>

      <title>Probing displaced (dark)photons from low reheating freeze-in at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Standard Model (SM) by introducing a $U(1)'$ gauge boson and a real pseudo-scalar field, both odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting low-energy spectrum consists of a stable vector as the dark matter candidate, and a pseudo-scalar mediator, which interacts with the SM via a Higgs portal coupling and a dimension-five portal connecting it to both the dark and visible photons. We explore the freeze-in of both particles at low reheating temperature, finding a rich yield evolution dynamics in the early Universe. This setup brings a consistent dark matter scenario in which the dark photon relic abundance is generated through freeze-in at low reheating temperatures. In addition to its cosmological viability, the model can be tested at the LHC: Higgs bosons can decay into dark photons and displaced visible photons via the long-lived mediator. These signatures allow us to constrain the Higgs portal coupling using recent searches for non-pointing photons and limits on invisible or undetected Higgs decays. We derive meaningful constraints on the dark matter parameter space, in particular excluding a thermalized mediator in the region compatible with the observed relic abundance.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dark Bosons at Chiral Belle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the advantages of a polarized electron beam at Belle II, as proposed for ``Chiral Belle'', in the search for invisibly decaying (dark) bosons that weakly couple to the Standard Model. By measuring the polarization dependence of the production cross section of dark bosons in association with a photon, the dark boson's spin and Lorentz structure of its couplings can potentially be determined. We analyze the mono-photon channel, $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \gamma + \text{invisible}$, in detail, focusing on the production of an on-shell spin-1 boson. We explore this in the context of three separate scenarios for a new dark vector: a dark photon, a mass-mixed ``dark $Z$'', and a vector that couples to right-handed electrons, and estimate how well the couplings of such bosons to electrons can be constrained in the event of a positive signal.</description>

      <title>Wino and Real Minimal Dark Matter Excluded by Fermi Gamma-Ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that minimal, fermionic dark matter (DM) models in the $n$-dimensional representation of the weak force with zero hypercharge that make up 100% of the DM under the standard cosmological history are strongly excluded for $n &lt; 9$. This includes the thermal wino, which we show is ruled out even allowing for DM core sizes up to $\sim$6.7 kpc with the preferred local DM density or $\sim$3.7 kpc in addition to the local DM density being half the preferred value, at less than $0.2$ GeV/cm$^3$. We reach these conclusions through dedicated searches with 14 years of Fermi gamma-ray data in the inner Galaxy between 30 GeV and 2 TeV for the continuum gamma-rays produced in the decays of unstable particles produced in DM annihilation and bound-state formation processes. We consider a variety of Milky Way DM profiles in our analyses, including those motivated by modern hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, and show that all the $n &lt; 9$ minimal DM models are disfavored even under the most conservative assumptions for these density profiles. While wino, quintuplet ($n=5$), and $n = 7$ DM models are strongly disfavored by our analyses under the standard cosmology, we discuss how non-standard cosmological histories or DM sub-fractions could still allow for these particles to be realized in nature, with discovery opportunities at next-generation particle colliders and gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>Strong CP from a Hidden Chiral Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models which solve the strong CP problem by employing discrete spacetime symmetries generically suffer fine-tuning and quality problems. We demonstrate that these issues are greatly ameliorated when the only source of spontaneous CP breaking is from the chiral condensate of a strongly coupled hidden sector. This is shown explicitly in a model with the SM extended by a vector-like quark family and a complex scalar portal to QCD-like dark sector with $N_f$ families of dark fermions that confines at a high scale. The dark pions of the hidden sector are natural dark matter candidates, with the correct relic abundance obtained via freeze-in. These "confining" Nelson-Barr solutions connect phenomenological questions regarding the strong CP problem to recent developments in the understanding of confining gauge theories, and present ample room for further model building.</description>

      <title>Testing Real WIMPs with CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast the reach of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to the full set of real representations within the paradigm of minimal dark matter. We employ effective field theory techniques to compute the annihilation cross section and photon spectrum that results when fermionic dark matter is the neutral component of an arbitrary odd and real representation of SU(2), including the Sommerfeld enhancement, next-to-leading log resummation of the relevant electroweak effects, and the contribution from bound states. We also compute the corresponding signals for scalar dark matter, with the exception of the bound state contribution. Results are presented for all real representations from the $\sim$3 TeV triplet (or wino), a $\mathbf{3}$ of SU(2), to the $\sim$300 TeV tredecuplet, a $\mathbf{13}$ of SU(2) that is at the threshold of the unitarity bound. Using these results, we forecast that with 500 hrs of Galactic Center observations and assuming background systematics are controlled at the level of ${\cal O}(1\%)$, then should no signal emerge, CTAO could exclude all representations up to the $\mathbf{11}$ of SU(2) in even the most conservative models for the dark-matter density in the inner galaxy, in both the fermionic and scalar dark matter cases. Assuming the default CTAO configuration, the tredecuplet will marginally escape exclusion, although we outline steps that CTAO could take to test even this scenario. In summary, CTAO appears poised to make a definitive statement on whether real WIMPs constitute the dark matter of our universe.</description>

      <title>Extracting Essential Non-perturbative Information in Jet Invariant Mass via the Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new three-dimensional non-perturbative (NP) function to account for and parameterize the NP contributions in the jet invariant mass spectrum, in addition to the conventional NP mass shift parametrization. By implementing Bayesian analysis on experimental data of the jet invariant mass from exclusive $W/Z+$jet events and inclusive jet events in $pp$ collisions at RHIC and LHC, where collisional energy increases by a factor of up to $65$ from RHIC to LHC, we ensure the analysis covers a wide range of data. For the first time, we simultaneously extract NP contributions from hadronization, initial soft-gluon radiation, and underlying events, based on two different NP prescriptions. We find that the contribution from initial soft-gluon radiation is negligible, and the hadronization effect dominates in the small-$R$ region, while underlying events provide the dominant contribution in the large-$R$ region. Moreover, when only hadronization effects are considered, our results successfully describe the jet mass data measured in $e^+e^-$ collisions, where only hadronization effects are expected to be present. Our work offers quantitative insights into understanding the soft hadronic contribution to jet substructure.</description>

      <title>Three-loop corrections to the Fermi decay constant in the $\overline{\rm{MS}}$ scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present the leading 3-loop contributions to the Fermi decay constant in the Standard Model, using the tadpole-free pure $\overline{\rm{MS}}$ scheme. The calculation is exact in the limit in which the QCD coupling, the top-quark Yukawa coupling, and the square root of the Higgs self-coupling are all treated as large compared to the electroweak gauge couplings. The effect of the 3-loop contribution is to decrease the estimate of the Higgs VEV, for fixed on-shell inputs, by about 3.5 MeV. The renormalization scale dependence of the computed Fermi constant is greatly reduced compared to the previously known complete 2-loop order result, and as a fraction is now less than $\pm 2 \times 10^{-6}$ for renormalization scales between 90 and 250 GeV. This corresponds to a theoretical uncertainty in the VEV that is well under 1 MeV, and much smaller than the current parametric uncertainties coming mostly from the top-quark mass. I also comment on the impact on the precise prediction of the $W$-boson mass.</description>

      <title>A critical appraisal of tests of locality and of entanglement versus non-entanglement at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been argued more than 30 years ago that it is not possible to test locality at colliders, due to the inability to directly measure non-commutating observables such as spin components in current collider experiments. Recently, there has been a lot of phenomenological and experimental activity around testing locality via Bell-type experiments or entanglement versus non-entanglement in a collider environment. These results seem to evade the earlier no-go theorem by indirectly measuring spin correlations via their relation to angular correlations between momenta. We perform a careful study of the feasibility of such an approach. We scrutinize the relationship between spin and angular correlations in both quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories. Our conclusion is that it is currently not possible to perform a logically coherent set of experimental measurements at colliders that would allow one to test locality or entanglement versus non-entanglement. This reaffirms the earlier no-go theorem. We stress that the no-go theorem does not apply to measurements of observables inspired from entanglement and Quantum Information Theory to test the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Colliders are Testing neither Locality via Bell's Inequality nor Entanglement versus Non-Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently there has been an increased interest in possible tests of locality via Bell's inequality or tests of entanglement at colliders, in particular at the LHC. These have involved various physical processes, such as $t \bar t$, or $\tau^+\tau^-$ production, or the decay of a Higgs boson to 2 vector bosons $H\to VV^*$. We argue that \textit{none} of these proposals constitute a test of locality via Bell's inequality or a test of quantum entanglement versus non-entanglement. In all cases what is measured are the momenta of the final state particles. Using the construction proposed by Kasday (1971) in a different context, and adapted to collider scenarios by Abel, Dittmar, and Dreiner (1992), it is straightforward to construct a local hidden variable theory (LHVT) which exactly reproduces the data. This construction is only possible as the final state momenta all commute. This LHVT satisfies Bell's inequality and is by construction \textit{not} entangled. Thus a test of locality via Bell's inequality or a test of entanglement versus non-entanglement is inherently \textit{not} possible.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Neutron Star vs. Low-Mass Black Hole Binaries with Postmerger Gravitational Waves $-$ Sensitivity to Transmuted Black Holes and Non-Annihilating Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of observed low-mass compact binary coalescences in the 1-2.5 $M_{\odot}$ range remains ambiguous. Both binary neutron star (BNS) and binary low-mass black hole (LMBH) mergers produce nearly identical inspiral waveforms, and electromagnetic follow-up is not always possible. Distinguishing between these scenarios therefore presents a key challenge. We demonstrate that waveform differences in the late-inspiral to postmerger epochs create significant mismatches that will be detectable by planned detectors, viz., NEMO, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope, while the currently operational LIGO A+ will be effective only for nearby sources. These differences are enhanced for stiffer equations of state. We show how the redshift-dependent compact binary merger rate inferred from gravitational wave observations can be parsed into BNS and LMBH components, accounting for misclassification probability. We forecast model-independent 90% exclusion sensitivities for the LMBH fraction. Interpreting these LMBHs as dark matter capture-induced transmuted black holes, we convert exclusion sensitivities into projected exclusion bounds on heavy non-annihilating dark matter. Our results illustrate how gravitational wave measurements can disentangle compact object populations and provide new insights into particle dark matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantifying EFT Uncertainties in LHC Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Field Theory (EFT) is a general framework to parametrize the low-energy approximation to a UV model that is widely used in model-independent searches for new physics. The use of EFTs at the LHC can suffer from a 'validity' issue, since new physics amplitudes often grow with energy and the kinematic regions with the most sensitivity to new physics have the largest theoretical uncertainties. We propose a method to account for these uncertainties with the aim of producing robust model-independent results with a well-defined statistical interpretation. In this approach, one must specify the new operators being studied as well as the new physics cutoff $M$, the energy scale where the EFT approximation breaks down. At energies below $M$, the EFT uncertainties are accounted for by adding additional higher dimensional operators with coefficients that are treated as nuisance parameters. The size of the nuisances are governed by a prior likelihood function that incorporates information about dimensional analysis, naturalness, and the scale $M$. At energies above $M$, our method incorporates the lack of predictivity of the EFT, and we show that this is crucial to obtain consistent results. We perform a number of tests of this method in a simple toy model, illustrating its performance in analyses aimed at new physics exclusion as well as for discovery. The method is conveniently implemented by the technique of event reweighting and is easily ported to realistic LHC analyses. We find that the procedure converges quickly with the number of nuisance parameters and is conservative when compared to UV models. The paper gives a precise meaning and offers a principled and practical solution to the widely debated 'EFT validity issue'.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV Dark Matter Under Pressure from Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DAMIC-M collaboration recently reported impressive bounds on sub-GeV dark matter, robustly testing both thermal and non-thermal models for the very first time. In this work we derive novel bounds from the recent PandaX-4T ionization S2-only search for Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS). We find that the PandaX-4T S2-only data is able to compete with the DAMIC-M results, providing the best constraints for scalar and asymmetric thermal dark matter models for masses between 20 to 200 MeV. We further discuss the implications of recent direct detection results for several other sub-GeV dark matter models, highlighting their complementarity with astrophysical, cosmological and laboratory probes.</description>

      <title>Covariant reggeization framework for diffraction. Part I: Hadronic tensors in Minkovsky space-time of any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the general structure of irreducible tensor representations of the Poincare group of arbitrary dimension with multiple sets of Lorentz indices and different ways to construct them from basic elements (Lorentz vectors and the metric tensor). Then we apply the same methods to obtain the expansion of general hadronic tensors in terms of these irreducible tensors. We propose to use an effective approach in hadronic diffraction, which was usually called covariant reggeization, and obtain basic functions to calculate all the diffractive cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Three-loop induced neutrino mass model in a non-invertible symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new type of radiatively induced neutrino masses at three-loop level based on the Ma model, introducing a non-invertible symmetry in the class under a ${\mathbb Z_2}$ gauging of ${\mathbb Z_6}$ symmetry and adding three isospin doublet vector-like fermions $L'$ and singlet boson $S_0$. Under this symmetry, the Yukawa interactions directly related to the neutrino masses are not allowed at tree-level. However it is allowed at one-loop level due to $L'$ and $S_0$ as well as $\eta$, which is no longer invariant under this symmetry. Therefore, the symmetry is dynamically broken. Intriguingly, $\eta$ plays important roles in contributing to both the radiative matrices $y^\eta$ and $m_\nu$. After constructing our model, we show some numerical analyses to satisfy the lepton flavor violations, muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment, and a boson dark matter candidate $S_0$ or $\eta_R$ for the cases of normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy. Then, we demonstrate allowed space for our input parameters.</description>

      <title>Probing Double-Peaked Gamma-Ray Spectra from Primordial Black Holes with Next-Generation Gamma-Ray Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), hypothesized to form in the early universe from gravitational collapse of density fluctuations, represent a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. Their potential detection through gamma-ray signatures arising from Hawking radiation would provide definitive evidence for their existence and constrain their contribution to the DM abundance. Unlike conventional DM candidates, PBHs emit a unique, thermal-like spectrum of particles as they evaporate, including photons, neutrinos, and possible beyond-the-Standard Model particles. Future high-sensitivity gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM and other next-generation telescopes, will play a pivotal role in this search. With improved energy resolution and sensitivity, these missions can disentangle PBH-originating photons from astrophysical backgrounds, probe subtle spectral features such as multi-peak structures, and test exotic evaporation models. Such observations could either confirm PBHs as a viable DM component or place stringent limits on their abundance across critical mass windows. In this work, we explore the distinguishing features of a double-peaked gamma-ray spectrum produced by PBHs, focusing on the asteroid-mass window ($10^{15}$ g to $10^{17}$ g), where Hawking radiation peaks in the MeV to GeV range. Using a likelihood-based analysis, we demonstrate how future missions could discriminate between single- and double-peaked PBH scenarios, the latter arising in cosmological models predicting multi-modal PBH mass distributions. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of spectral shape analysis in identifying PBH populations and constrain the parameter space for which a double-peaked signal could be detectable above background.</description>

      <title>Split supersymmetry and hybrid inflation in light of Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent measurement of the scalar spectral index, $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data, we present an update on the split supersymmetry hybrid inflation model, also known as $\mu$-term hybrid inflation. The model employs a canonical K\"{a}hler potential but incorporates an additional renormalizable term in the superpotential $W$, which yields the MSSM $\mu$-term following supersymmetry breaking. This additional term in $W$ is responsible for a high reheat temperature, $T_r \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV, and consequently the necessity of split supersymmetry in this class of models. The predicted scalar spectral index is in excellent agreement with the ACT measurement and $r$, the tensor to scalar ratio, is estimated to be less than or of order $10^{-2} -10^{-3}$. For the running of the scalar spectral index we find $|dn_s/d \ln k| = O(10^{-4})$. With $T_r \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV, leptogenesis is readily implemented in this class of models. A wino-like LSP with mass of around 2 TeV is a plausible dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Correlation function for the $n \bar{D}_{s0}^*(2317)$ interaction and the issue of elastic unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a neutron with the $\bar D_{s0}^*(2317)$ resonance and look at the amplitude below threshold and close above threshold. The study is done from the perspective that the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ resonance is a molecular state of $DK$. To study this interaction, we use the Fixed Center Approximation to Faddeev equations that considers the $DK$ molecule as the cluster and the neutron as the external particle. We improve the Fixed Center approach to implement elastic unitarity around threshold, which is needed to obtain scattering parameters and to evaluate the $n \bar D_{s0}^*(2317)$ correlation function that we determine here. One interesting result of the study is the appearance of a resonant state below threshold with a binding of about 130 MeV and a width of about 80 MeV, which we suggest to look at in reactions measuring the invariant mass of $\pi \Sigma \bar D$. The ALICE collaboration has initiated studies of this type, by looking at the $p f_1(1285)$ correlation function, and we can only encourage work in this direction which should provide much valuable information on the nature of many resonant states.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Admixed Strange Stars: An Effective Single-Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and physical properties of strange stars admixed with dark matter by modeling the total energy density as a weighted combination of quark matter and bosonic dark matter components regulated by a volume fraction. Both the components are assumed to be distributed throughout the star. The quark matter is described by a linear equation of state (EOS), whereas the bosonic dark matter follows an EOS with repulsive self-interactions. By combining these into a single effective EOS, we reduce the two-fluid system to an equivalent one-fluid model and numerically solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to obtain the mass-radius (M-R) relationship of the hybrid configuration. We systematically analyze how the stellar structure is modified by varying dark matter fractions, the mass of the dark matter particle and the self-repulsion coupling strength. Our results reveal distinct modifications to the M-R profiles and apparent phase behavior of the quark matter suggesting observable signatures that could offer insights into the properties of dark matter in extreme astrophysical environments. This model also provides a possible explanation for ultra-compact stars with small radii, such as XTE J1814-338, suggesting its potential nature as a hybrid star.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Structure Function at the Limit $x=Q^2/s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longitudinal structure function for nucleons and nuclei is considered at fixed $\sqrt{s}$ and $Q^2$ to the minimum value of $x$ given by $Q^2/s$. This is done using the expansion method and color dipole model in the next-to-leading order approximation. The extracted longitudinal structure functions were consistent with HERA hepdata [ https://www.hepdata.net/record/ins1377206] and the determination of $F_{L}$ at $x=Q^2/s$ [Frank E.Taylor, Phys. Rev. D {\bf111}, 052001 (2025)] at moderate and large $Q^2$ values. The results, consistent with the dipole picture at low $Q^2$ values, show that the longitudinal structure function is small as expected due to the transverse polarization of the exchanged photon and the strong suppression of the dominant gluon component. Nonlinear corrections to the nuclear longitudinal structure function at low values of $x$ and $Q^2$ are also considered. These results may enhace the deep inelastic scattering neutral current data in future colliders at low $x$ and low $Q^2$.</description>

      <title>Probing Large $N_f$ Through Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reliability of the large $N_f$ expansion of four-dimensional gauge-fermion quantum field theories, focusing on the structure and scheme dependence of the beta function. While the existence of a nontrivial UV fixed point at leading order in $1/N_f$ suggests the possibility of asymptotic safety, the absence of higher-order terms precludes robust conclusions. We analyze the impact of renormalization scheme transformations and show that higher-order corrections inevitably introduce increasingly singular contributions. We prove that at most one renormalization scheme can preserve the dominance of the leading contribution, rendering the truncation trustworthy; in all other schemes, higher-order terms dominate and the expansion becomes unreliable. This result places strong constraints on the physical interpretation of UV fixed points in large $N_f$ theories and emphasizes the need for resummation or non-perturbative control to establish asymptotic safety.</description>

In particular, I restore the compactness of the Standard Model gauge group, and explain the symmetry-breaking of the weak $SU(2)$ in terms of the symmetry-breaking between the three generations of elementary fermions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the mass spectra of fully heavy pentaquark states $QQQQ\bar{Q}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules.

      <title>Impact of cavities on the detection of quadratically coupled ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-light scalar fields may explain the nature of the dark matter in our universe. If such scalars couple quadratically to particles of the Standard Model the scalar acquires an effective mass which depends on the local matter energy density. The changing mass causes the field to deviate from its cosmological value in experimental environments. In this work we show that the presence of a local over-density enclosing the experiment, for example a cavity, vacuum chamber, or satellite can strongly suppress the value of the scalar and its gradient in the interior. This makes detection of such scalar dark matter challenging, and significantly relaxes constraints on strongly coupled models. We also discuss the possibility that quadratically coupled ultra-light scalar dark matter could be detected by the differential measurement of the force on two cavities of the same mass but different internal structure.</description>

      <title>Dark matter explanations for the neutrino emission from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the high-energy neutrino flux observed from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 originates from dark matter annihilations within the density spike surrounding the supermassive black hole at its center. The comparatively lower gamma-ray flux is attributed to a dark sector that couples predominantly to Standard Model neutrinos. To explain the absence of a corresponding neutrino signal from the center of the Milky Way, we propose two scenarios: (i) the disruption of the dark matter spike at the Milky Way center due to stellar heating, or (ii) the annihilation into a dark scalar that decays exclusively into neutrinos, with a decay length longer than the size of the Milky Way but shorter than the distance from Earth to NGC 1068.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of axion echoes in the context of multiple ALP models. We begin by reviewing the single ALP case, deriving the conditions for resonance and echo formation. Starting from a set of N ALPs coupling to the photon, we then derive the relevant echo equations for both coherent and incoherent configurations. In the former case, we show that the echo power scales with N leading to sharper amplification and potentially improving projected bounds discussed earlier in literature. Small mass splittings between the ALPs further increase this amplification, even for a N = 2 case. We also outline the potential experimental implications of our results and discuss prospects for detecting these echoes in a wide range of ALP masses. In the incoherent scenario, we show that the random phases lead to a suppression of the echo power, eventually resulting in observable signals akin to or even weaker than the single ALP case.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Scalar Sector of Grand Unification: Phenomenology &amp; Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) based on groups like $SO(10)$ and $SU(5)$ unify Standard Model (SM) fermions into irreducible representations (irreps), and predict additional scalar fields beyond the SM Higgs. In $SO(10)$ GUTs, the scalar fields can arise from irreps contributing to the Yukawa sector at the renormalisable level, such as $10_{\mathrm{H}}$, $120_{\mathrm{H}}$, and $\overline{126}_{\mathrm{H}}$, or from $16_{\mathrm{H}}$ in non-renormalisable interactions. The direct implications of these scalars include the violation of baryon and lepton number, enabling processes such as nucleon decays, neutron-antineutron oscillation, and potentially accounting for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. We systematically analyse their couplings to SM fermions, identifying diquark and leptoquark interactions vertices involving all scalars residing in $10_{\mathrm{H}}$, $120_{\mathrm{H}}$, $\overline{126}_{\mathrm{H}}$, and $16_{\mathrm{H}}$ and comprehensively assess their contributions to nucleon decay, neutron-antineutron oscillation, quark flavour violation, and baryogenesis. Constraints on the masses of these scalars, derived from experimental bounds on the aforementioned processes, are also estimated. Conventional GUTs rely on multiple scalar irreps to avoid unrealistic fermion mass relations; for example, minimal $SU(5)$ with $5_{\mathrm{H}}$ predicts degenerate down-quark and charged-lepton masses. We demonstrate that quantum corrections from heavy scalars in a minimally extended $SU(5)$ model can lift this degeneracy, thereby reducing the arbitrariness in the scalar sector, which has been called as indirect impact. This thesis provides a comprehensive examination of the scalar sector's role in GUTs, establishing connections between UV-complete models and observable phenomena.</description>

      <title>Scalar-induced Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in $SU(5)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the role of heavy scalar fields in mediating neutrinoless double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ within the $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory framework, extended suitably to include neutrino mass. In such a minimal realistic $SU(5)$ setup for fermion masses, the scalar contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ are extremely suppressed as a consequence of the proton decay bound. We circumvent this problem by imposing a discrete ${\cal Z}_3$ symmetry. However, the scalar contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ remain suppressed in this $SU(5) \times {\cal Z}_3$ model due to the neutrino mass constraint. We find that the $0\nu\beta\beta$ contribution can be enhanced by extending the scalar sector with an additional $\mathbf{15}$-dimensional scalar representation with suitable ${\cal Z}_3$ charge. Such an extension not only yields realistic fermion mass spectra but also leads to experimentally testable predictions in upcoming ton-scale $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches, which can be used as a sensitive probe of the new scalars across a broad range, from LHC-accessible scales up to $\sim 10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hidden-charm decays serve as irreplaceable platforms for probing the structures of charmonium-like states, such as $X(3872)$, $Y(4260)$, $Z_c(3900)$, and their heavy-quark-symmetry partners. In the hadronic molecular scenario, these hidden-charm decays are denominated by intermediate meson loops (IMLs), and the couplings of $\chi_{cJ}\to D^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$ are building blocks of the amplitudes for the pionic and radiative transitions of the charmonium-like states to the $\chi_{cJ}$ and $h_c$ states, e.g., $X(3872)\to \pi^0\chi_{cJ},\,\pi\pi\chi_{cJ},\,\gamma\chi_{cJ}$ and $Y(4260)\to \pi^0 h_c,\,\eta h_c$. These couplings can not be extracted from the partial decay widths of the $\chi_{cJ}$ directly and only have estimated values from the vector meson dominance (VMD) model. Utilizing the recent precise determination of the pole position and the isospin breaking properties of the $X(3872)$, we give an estimation on the upper bounds of the absolute values of the $\chi_{cJ}\to D^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$ couplings. Our results show that the VMD model may over estimate the $\chi_{cJ}\to D^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$ couplings considering the $X(3872)$ as a $D\bar{D}^{*}$ hadronic molecule with a binding energy about tens of keV. These upper limits can be used and tested in other hidden-charm transitions of the charmonium-like states to the $\chi_{cJ}$ and $h_c$.</description>

      <title>Ring-based ML calibration with in situ pileup correction for real-time jet triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) method to calibrate hadronic jet energy in real-time trigger systems of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) using an efficient implementation on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). Regression is done to estimate the transverse energy of jet candidates, using concentric rings of electromagnetic and hadronic contributions in 0.1 x 0.1 towers around fixed-radius cone jet seeds, that accounts for in situ pileup correction. Classification separates hard-scatter jets from those due to pileup using the same inputs; its output provides a correction for the regression estimate. The algorithm is tested on simulated samples using an ATLAS-inspired detector in the dense environment of 200 simultaneous proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing. Our method improves the signal efficiency of saving Higgs pair production in HH -&gt; bbbb by a factor of two over the traditional cone jet algorithm in real-time trigger systems.</description>

      <title>Abelian-Higgs vortices in the oscillating axion background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Abelian-Higgs vortices in the background of a coherently oscillating axion field. We show that the electric field is induced in the magnetic core of the vortex due to the axion-photon conversion. Moreover, because the electromagnetic field is confined in the vortex and excluded from the superconducting bulk regions due to the Meissner effect, the vortex tube can be regarded as a cylindrical cavity, and our numerical analysis shows that the resonant cavity mode (TM010 mode) can be efficiently enhanced in this tube. We also focus on the interaction of two vortices in the oscillating axion background, resulting in attractive or repulsive forces, even in the case with the BPS limit. These new features open up a new possibility for the axion dark matter search using superconducting devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double-charmonium scattering states such as $J/\psi J/\psi$, $\eta_cJ/\psi$, and $\eta_c\eta_c$ are investigated by a simplified quark cluster model. It is found that the quark Pauli-principle over the $c\bar c c\bar c$ system causes a rapid increase and a node in the two-meson phase shifts. The increase is not large enough to be regarded as a resonance, but if it is seen experimentally, that is most likely the quark Pauli-blocking effect.</description>

      <title>Systematic Improvement of Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory is a framework that aims to improve the results of Hamiltonian truncation in a systematic, order-by-order fashion using Effective Field Theory methodology. The result is a truncated effective Hamiltonian with corrections that result from a matching procedure. We establish the rigor of this method by calculating nontrival next-to-leading order corrections in a $1/E_{\rm max}$ expansion, where $E_{\rm max}$ is our effective theory cutoff. We illustrate this explicitly using 1+1D $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, calculating corrections up to order $1/E_{\rm max}^3$. At this order, novel nonlocal contributions to the matching conditions must be incorporated. We show that by including these nonlocal terms, the error scales as $1/E_{\rm max}^4$, as expected from the Effective Field Theory power counting, providing a nontrivial check that this method is consistent and robust. We also estimate the critical coupling at which this theory flows to the 2D Ising conformal field theory and confirm that separation of scales, an essential feature of Effective Field Theory, persists at this order. These results establish Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory as a generic, systematic framework for improving convergence in Hamiltonian truncation and lay the groundwork to apply this method to more complex systems in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for constructing lattice QCD operators for systems of an arbitrary number of particles with arbitrary momentum, spin, and internal quantum numbers. Explicit constructions are provided for one-, two-, three-, and four-hadron operators, covering all irreducible representations of the relevant lattice symmetry groups in both rest and moving frames. The construction procedure has been implemented in the open-source package \texttt{OpTion} (Operator construcTion), available at https://github.com/wittscien/OpTion. The paper and the package are designed to serve as a practical and extensible dictionary for future lattice QCD studies, as lattice calculations advance towards increasingly complex hadronic systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetric-asymmetric collision comparison: disentangling nuclear structure and subnucleonic structure effects for small system flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous flow measurements in small collision systems were mostly based on highly asymmetric collisions ($p$+Pb, $p$+Au, $d$+Au, $^{3}$He+Au), where both nuclear structure and subnucleonic fluctuations are important. Comparing these asymmetric systems with the newly available symmetric $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at RHIC and LHC provides a unique opportunity to disentangle these two contributions. Using Glauber models incorporating both nucleon and quark-level substructure, we analyze multiplicity distributions and initial-state estimators: eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$ for anisotropic flow $v_n$ and inverse transverse size $d_{\perp}$ for radial flow. We find that subnucleonic fluctuations impact O+O collisions differently from asymmetric systems, creating specific patterns in flow observables that enable disentangling the competing contributions. Such experimental comparisons will reduce uncertainties in the initial conditions and improve our understanding of the properties of the QGP-like medium produced in small systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the predictions of various observables for strange ($\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm S}$, $\Lambda$($\overline{\Lambda}$)) and multi-strange hadrons ($\Xi^-$($\overline{\Xi}^+$), $\phi$, and $\Omega^-$($\overline{\Omega}^+$)) using the recently updated 3+1D hydrodynamics-based EPOS4 framework and AMPT model. In this study, we report the transverse momentum (${p_{\rm T}}$) spectra, particle yields (${\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}y}$), and ${p_{\rm T}}$ integrated yield ratios relative to pions for $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=7$~TeV. The results reveal that there are indications of stronger radial flow in EPOS4 compared to AMPT. We observe a final state multiplicity overlap with small ($p+p$ and $p+Pb$) and large ($Pb+Pb$) collision systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we report the predictions for the flow observables for different centrality classes in $O+O$ collisions. Our predictions utilize two different approaches, hydrodynamic and transport models, to analyze the behavior of the flow coefficients for identified ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p (\overline{p})$) and strange ($\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm S}$, $\Lambda$ ($\overline{\Lambda}$), $\Omega^{-}$ ($\overline{\Omega}^{+}$), $\Xi^{-}$ ($\overline{\Xi}^{+}$), $\phi$) hadrons. We explore particle-by-particle flow and compare the response of the system to initial conditions across various models, which provide insights into the underlying partonic and hadronic dynamics. The study presents comparisons of flow harmonics with the existing experimental measurements and demonstrates how $O+O$ collisions can serve as a benchmark to understand the transition from small to large systems, contributing to our knowledge of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and collective phenomena in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>SUSY Highlights: Current Results and Future Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, one of the goals of colliding protons together is to search for new physics. Supersymmetry (SUSY), a popular theory of physics beyond the well-established standard model of particle physics, is a large part of the search program of the ATLAS and CMS multi-purpose detectors located on opposite sides of the 27-kilometer LHC ring. So far no sign of supersymmetry has been found in the most obvious search channels such as all-hadronic searches with jets and missing energy. This led to the development of many new search strategies. A selection of current results, including several observations of deviations from the standard model and novel search techniques, as well as future prospects are discussed in this talk.</description>

      <title>Flat-band thermodynamics reveals enhanced performance across Otto, Carnot, and Stirling cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Preference for a Positive Neutrino Mass at 2.7$\sigma$: A Joint Analysis of DESI DR2, DESY5, and DESY1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conversion of gravitational to electromagnetic waves in the presence of background magnetic fields is known as the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, analogous to the Primakoff effect for axions. Rephrasing this conversion as a classical electrodynamics problem in the far-field regime of a magnetized region, we derive the angular distribution of the intensity and polarization of the emitted electromagnetic waves. We discuss the interplay of the internal structure of the magnetic field, the polarization of the gravitational wave and the scattering angle, demonstrating for example that a dipolar field can convert an unpolarized stochastic gravitational wave background into polarized electromagnetic emission, with peak emission intensity along the equator. We moreover outline how to incorporate medium effects in this framework, necessary for a realistic 3D description of gravitational wave to photon conversion in the magnetosphere of neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider models where the dilaton, seen as the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, plays the role of dark energy. We revisit Weinberg's theorem and show that quantum corrections induced by the graviton lead to the screening of the dilaton locally. We also discuss the time evolution of the equation of state and find that phantom crossing is a natural feature of these models. The time variation of the equation of state and its deviation from $-1$ is limited by screening locally and can only be relaxed when the dilaton is allowed to have a mass of the order of the Hubble rate cosmologically, thus going beyond single-field screened dark-energy models. This obstruction extends to all single-field screened models of the chameleon-type where the large mass of the scalar on cosmological scales leads to a negligible variation of the equation of state at low redshift.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we discuss various phenomenological implications of possible R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetric scenarios. In this context, the implications of both bilinear and trilinear RPV terms are reviewed from the viewpoint of neutrino physics, anomalous muon magnetic moment, different flavor observables, and collider physics. Apart from discussing the distinctive phenomenological implications of the RPV scenarios, we also survey the updated results from different studies to highlight the present status of the RPV couplings.</description>

Abstract: We propose two new predictive neutrino mass matrix textures that deviate from $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry and explore their phenomenological implications. These textures are significant due to their predictive nature and the unique approach they introduce for breaking the $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry. Both textures predict six physical parameters and impose sharp constraints on $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta$, considering both normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings. In addition, we realize the textures in their exact form within the framework of the seesaw mechanism, based on the $SU(2)_L \times A_4 \times Z_3$ symmetry group.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are now being extensively used in our daily lives, spanning across diverse industries as well as academia. In the field of high energy physics (HEP), the most common and challenging task is separating a rare signal from a much larger background. The boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm has been a cornerstone of the high energy physics for analyzing event triggering, particle identification, jet tagging, object reconstruction, event classification, and other related tasks for quite some time. This article presents a comprehensive overview of research conducted by both HEP experimental and phenomenological groups that utilize decision tree algorithms in the context of the Standard Model and Supersymmetry (SUSY). We also summarize the basic concept of machine learning and decision tree algorithm along with the working principle of \texttt{Random Forest}, \texttt{AdaBoost} and two gradient boosting frameworks, such as \texttt{XGBoost}, and \texttt{LightGBM}. Using a case study of electroweakino productions at the high luminosity LHC, we demonstrate how these algorithms lead to improvement in the search sensitivity compared to traditional cut-based methods in both compressed and non-compressed R-parity conserving SUSY scenarios. The effect of different hyperparameters and their optimization, feature importance study using SHapley values are also discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Study of Neutrino Phenomenology and $0\nu\beta\beta$ Decay using Polyharmonic $Maa\beta$ Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of the $\Gamma_{3}$ modular group, which is isomorphic to the $A_{4}$ symmetric group in developing a model for neutrino mass. We realized a non-supersymmetric left-right asymmetric model incorporating modular symmetry, where the modular forms consist of both holomorphic and non-holomorphic components and the Yukawa couplings expressed through polyharmonic $Maa\beta$ forms. To effectively implement the extended see-saw process in this model, we introduce one fermion singlet for each generation. We compute the effective mass and the associated half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ by accounting for both standard and non-standard contributions. Additionally, our study investigates the non-unitary effects and CP-violation arising from non-unitarity in this context. The model predicts values for the sum of neutrino masses and neutrino oscillation parameters are constraints with experiments. Furthermore, it yields satisfactory results in calculating the effective mass and half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. These findings highlight the possibility and benefit of employing modular symmetry in neutrino mass model construction.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical string fragmentation and string density effects in jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed to search for thermal and collective properties arising from parton-fragmentation processes by examining high jet charged-constituent multiplicities ($N_{\rm j,ch}$) in proton-proton (pp) collisions. This proposal was initially tested using the PYTHIA~8 event generator with the Monash tune, which incorporates multiparton interactions (MPI) and the MPI-based colour reconnection (CR) model. These studies did not reveal any conclusive evidence for the presence of radial flow. In this paper, we expand upon the proposed Monte Carlo study by eliminating selection biases associated with triggering on charged particle multiplicities. Furthermore, MPI are disabled to focus exclusively on jet fragments. We analyse pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV simulated with PYTHIA~8, exploring different implementations of the generator: thermodynamical string fragmentation and the standard Lund fragmentation model. The impact of colour-string juctions was also explored. Surprisingly, the thermodynamical string fragmentation together with the close-packing of strings mechanism predicts a hint of baryon enhancement in jets. Additionally, the light-flavor baryon-to-meson ratios as a function of $j_{\rm T}$ exhibit similarities across all PYTHIA~8 implementations, and hint at radial flow-like effects. In contrast, the ratio of heavy-flavor hadrons (\LcToDz) at low $j_{\rm T}$ as a function of $N_{\rm j,ch}$ shows a trend similar to that observed as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in minimum-bias data, suggesting that colour-string junctions may play a crucial role in heavy baryon production in jets. The same mechanism also predicts a $j_{\rm T}$-integrated \LcToDz ratio that increases with increasing $N_{\rm j,ch}$.</description>

      <title>Dirac Leptogenesis in Left-Right Symmetric Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Left-right symmetric models which employ a generalized seesaw mechanism to generate quark and charged lepton masses are known to solve the strong CP problem via parity symmetry, without the need for the axion. These models lead to naturally light Dirac neutrinos with their masses arising through radiatve corrections. In this work, we show how baryogenesis via Dirac leptogenesis can be implemented in this framework. A pair of left-right symmetric scalar doublets $\phi_{L,R}$ carrying $(B-L)$ charge of $3$ is introduced for this purpose, which preserves the parity solution to the strong CP problem. Small neutrino masses are generated through one-loop diagrams mediated by these scalars. The decay of vector-like leptons ($E_i$) involved in the seesaw mechanism to generate charged lepton masses, $E_i \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{jR} \,\phi_R^-$, creates a right-handed neutrino ($\nu_{R}$) asymmetry, while preserving total lepton number. The compensating lepton asymmetry is converted to baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. We show that for a large range of model parameters successful baryogenesis can be realized, with the $W_R^\pm$ gauge boson mass of order $10^{11}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to probe trilinear $R$-parity violating SUSY scenarios and possible LHC signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we probe the trilinear $R$-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetric (SUSY) scenarios with specific nonzero interactions in the light of neutrino oscillation, Higgs, and flavor observables. We attempt to fit the set of observables using a state-of-the-art Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) setup and study its impact on the model parameter space. Our main objective is to constrain the trilinear couplings individually, along with some other SUSY parameters relevant to the observables. We present the constrained parameter regions in the form of marginalized posterior distributions on different two-dimensional parameter planes. We perform our analyses with two different scenarios characterized by our choices for the lightest SUSY particle (LSP), bino, and stop. Our results indicate that the lepton number violating trilinear couplings $\lambda_{i33}$ ($i$=1,2) and $\lambda_{j33}^{\prime}$ ($j$=1,2,3) can be at most of the order of $10^{-4}$ or even smaller while $\tan\beta$ is restricted to below 15 even when $3\sigma$ allowed regions are considered. We further comment on the possible LHC signatures of these LSPs focusing on and around the best-fit regions.</description>

      <title>Determination of the Strong Coupling Constant $\alpha_s$ from Inclusive Semi-leptonic $B$ Meson Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of determining the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s$, from the inclusive semileptonic decay width of $B$ mesons.
  We express the semileptonic $B$ decay width as a function of $\alpha_s(5\mathrm{\,GeV})$, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cb}|$, $b$- and $c$-quark masses in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme.
  We fit $\alpha_s(5\mathrm{\,GeV})$ to current world averages of the $B^{\pm}$ and $B^{0}$ semileptonic decay widths.
  This yields $\alpha_s(5\mathrm{\,GeV}) = 0.245 \pm 0.009$, corresponding to a 5-flavor extrapolation of $\alpha_s(m_{Z}) = 0.1266 \pm 0.0023$.
  The primary uncertainty contributions arise from the uncertainty on the perturbative expansion and the value of $|V_{cb}|$.
  Future advancements including higher-order perturbative calculations,
  and precise measurements of $|V_{cb}|$ and $B$ decay widths from upcoming $B$ and $Z$ factores,
  could enable this method to determine $\alpha_s(m_{Z})$ with a competitive precision of $\Delta\alpha_s(m_{Z}) \sim 0.0018$.
  This precision is comparable to the current accuracy of $\alpha_s(m_{Z})$ measurements from $\tau$-lepton decays, which is regarded as the most precise approach.</description>

      <title>Light-by-Light scattering in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions: Estimating inelastic contributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current state-of-the-art theoretical estimations lead to cross-sections for $AA \to \gamma \gamma AA$ which are somewhat smaller than the measured ones by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, which motivates the searching and calculation of subleading corrections disregarded in these previous studies. In this paper, we estimate for the first time the contribution of inelastic channels to the Light-by-Light (LbL) scattering in ultraperipheral collisions of heavy ions (UPHICs), in which one or both of the incident nuclei dissociate ($A A \to \gamma \gamma X Y$ where $X, Y = A, A'$) due to the photon emission. These new mechanisms are related to extra emissions that are rather difficult to identify at the LHC and may be misinterpreted as enhanced $\gamma \gamma \to \gamma \gamma$ scattering compared to the Standard Model result. We include processes of coupling of photons to individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) in addition to coherent coupling to the whole nuclei (called standard approach here). Both elastic (nucleon in the ground state) and inelastic (nucleon in an excited state) in the couplings of photons to nucleons are taken into account. The inelastic nucleon fluxes are calculated using CT18qed photon in nucleon PDFs. The inelastic photon fluxes are shown and compared to standard photon fluxes in the nucleus. In addition, we show the ratio of the inelastic corrections to the standard contribution as a function of diphoton invariant mass and photon rapidity difference. We find that for the ATLAS acceptance region the inelastic corrections grow with $M_{\gamma \gamma}$ and rapidity difference. Our results indicate that the inelastic contributions can be of the order of 20-40 \% of the traditional (no nuclear excitation) predictions. Uncertainties due to factorization scale choice are quantified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a novel gravitational wave (GW) production mechanism from gravitons generated during the pre-thermal phase of cosmic reheating, where the energy density is dominated by non-thermalized inflaton decay products, dubbed reheatons. We consider multiple production channels, including: $i)$ pure inflaton-inflaton annihilation, $ii)$ graviton Bremsstrahlung from inflaton decay, $iii)$ scatterings between an inflaton and a reheaton, and $iv)$ scatterings among reheatons. To determine the resulting GW spectrum, we solve the Boltzmann equation to obtain the graviton phase-space distribution for each channel. We find that the third channel, $iii)$, dominates due to the large occupation number of reheatons at highly-energetic states during the pre-thermalization phase. Notably, in scenarios with a low inflaton mass, the GW spectrum could fall within the sensitivity range of future experiments such as the Einstein Telescope, the Cosmic Explorer, the Big Bang Observer, and ultimate DECIGO.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we adopt the one-boson exchange model to analyze the $D^{(*)}_{(s)}B^{(*)}_{(s)}$ interactions from a coupled-channel perspective. For the $I(J^{P})=1(1^{+})$ $DB^{*}/D^*B/D^*B^{*}$ system, employing the complex scaling method, we obtain a loosely bound state and two resonant states located below the $DB^{*}$, $D^*B$, and $D^*B^{*}$ thresholds, respectively. Assuming that the charmonium-like states $T_{c\bar{c}1}(3900)$ and $T_{c\bar{c}1}(4020)$, as well as the bottomonium-like states $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10610)$ and $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10650)$, are molecular states near their respective thresholds, we suggest that the predicted states in the $I(J^P)=1(1^+)$ $D^{(*)}_{(s)}B^{(*)}_{(s)}$ system could be their bottom-charmed analogues. In addition, we extend our analysis to other $D^{(*)}_{(s)}B^{(*)}_{(s)}$ combinations with various quantum numbers. Our results suggest that some exotic structures may exist in the bottom-charmed sector. Finally, we collect the possible decay channels for future experimental observations. The $B_c/B_c^*$ plus a light meson are the ideal final state to search for the bound states, while the $D_{(s)}^{(*)}B_{(s)}^{(*)}$ channels are suitable for the resonances. We highly recommend that the future experiments hunt for these bottom-charmed exotic particles.</description>

Abstract: Following up on our earlier study in [J. Bardhan et al., Machine learning-enhanced search for a vectorlike singlet B quark decaying to a singlet scalar or pseudoscalar, Phys. Rev. D 107 (2023) 115001; arXiv:2212.02442], we investigate the LHC prospects of pair-produced vectorlike $B$ quarks decaying exotically to a new gauge-singlet (pseudo)scalar field $\Phi$ and a $b$ quark. After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the $\Phi$ decays predominantly to $gg/bb$ final states, leading to a fully hadronic $2b+4j$ or $6b$ signature. Because of the large Standard Model background and the lack of leptonic handles, it is a difficult channel to probe. To overcome the challenge, we employ a hybrid deep learning model containing a graph neural network followed by a deep neural network. We estimate that such a state-of-the-art deep learning analysis pipeline can lead to a performance comparable to that in the semi-leptonic mode, taking the discovery (exclusion) reach up to about $M_B=1.8\:(2.4)$ TeV at HL-LHC when $B$ decays fully exotically, i.e., BR$(B \to b\Phi) = 100\%$.</description>

Abstract: In the presence of a finite modular flavour symmetry, fermion mass hierarchies may be generated by a slight deviation of the modulus from a symmetric point. We point out that this small parameter governing charged-lepton mass hierarchies may also be responsible for the breaking of lepton number in a symmetry-protected low-scale seesaw, sourcing active neutrino masses and the mass splitting of a pseudo-Dirac pair of heavy neutrinos. We discuss the phenomenological implications of this mechanism, including the possibility to test the considered models at future planned and proposed heavy neutral lepton searches.</description>

Abstract: NuMI Off-axis $\nu_e$ Appearance (NOvA) experiment is an ongoing long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. The primary channels of interest are the $\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_e$ appearance, $\nu_\mu$, $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ disappearance channels analyzed in the energy window $1&lt; E_\nu &lt; 4$ GeV. However, NOvA far detector sees non-trivial high energy $\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_e$ events in the energy range $4 &lt; E_\nu &lt; 20$ GeV. These high energy events provide us with an opportunity to investigate the subleading new physics scenarios. In this context, we study the sensitivity of the NOvA experiment to constrain the non-standard interaction (NSI) parameters and environmental decoherence. We observe that by including high energy events (signal + background) the degeneracy around $\epsilon_{e\tau} \sim 1.6$ can be removed throughout the $\delta_{CP}$ and $\delta_{e\tau}$ range. Further, we examine the role of signal versus beam background events in removing this degeneracy. In addition, we constrain the decoherence parameter $\Gamma$ considering events from $1&lt;E_\nu&lt;20$ GeV. Later, assuming the presence of decoherence in nature we obtain the allowed regions in $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{CP}$ plane.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian chiral kinetic theory with self-consistent semiclassical expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the chiral kinetic theory in a non-Abelian gauge field using a self-consistent semiclassical expansion. Within this new expansion scheme, we disentangle the Wigner equations up to second order and demonstrate that they do not introduce additional constraint equations. By integrating the covariant chiral kinetic equations in eight-dimensional phase space, we obtain the corresponding equations in seven-dimensional phase space. This reduction facilitates numerical simulations and practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gallium anomaly, a persistent discrepancy exceeding $4\sigma$ in the $^{71}$Ga neutrino capture rates from $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar calibration sources by the GALLEX, SAGE, and recently BEST experiments, has challenged particle physics and nuclear theory for over three decades. We present a new calculation for the neutrino capture cross-section, abandoning the conventional leading-order approximation for electronic wave functions by numerically solving the Dirac-Coulomb equation for both bound and continuum electron states. Finally, we re-evaluate the gallium anomaly, updating its global significance and presenting the most up-to-date status of its interpretation in terms of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive approach to the physics of mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Simulating Nuclear Effective Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers offer the potential to simulate nuclear processes that are classically intractable. With the goal of understanding the necessary quantum resources to realize this potential, we employ state-of-the-art Hamiltonian-simulation methods, and conduct a thorough algorithmic analysis, to estimate the qubit and gate costs to simulate low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) of nuclear physics. Within the framework of nuclear lattice EFT, we obtain simulation costs for the leading-order pionless and pionful EFTs. For the latter, we consider both static pions represented by a one-pion-exchange potential between the nucleons, and dynamical pions represented by relativistic bosonic fields coupled to non-relativistic nucleons. Within these models, we examine the resource costs for the tasks of time evolution and energy estimation for physically relevant scales. We account for model errors associated with truncating either long-range interactions in the one-pion-exchange EFT or the pionic Hilbert space in the dynamical-pion EFT, and for algorithmic errors associated with product-formula approximations and quantum phase estimation. We find that the pionless EFT is the least costly to simulate, followed by the one-pion-exchange theory, then the dynamical-pion theory. We demonstrate how symmetries of the low-energy nuclear Hamiltonians can be utilized to obtain tighter error bounds. By retaining the locality of nucleonic interactions when mapped to qubits, we achieve reduced circuit depth and substantial parallelization. In the process, we develop new methods to bound the algorithmic error for classes of fermionic number-preserving Hamiltonians, and obtain tighter Trotter error bounds by explicitly computing nested commutators of Hamiltonian terms. Compared to previous estimates for the pionless EFT, our results represent an improvement by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant, Dark Matter and the ElectroWeak Scale meet in the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Swampland program, which looks for low energy theories consistent with quantum gravity, has led to the introduction of a dark dimension stemming from the cosmological constant. We show that the same argument leads to the emergence of the electroweak scale, once the dark dimension is realised in a warped background. A second warped extra dimension at the TeV scale is, therefore, postulated, where the long-standing problem of the hierarchy between the electroweak and the Planck scales can be addressed. Furthermore, standard model contributions to the cosmological constant are tamed, together with the gravitational ones. In the emergent holistic picture of gravity and gauge interactions, both Planck and the electroweak scales are emergent from a theory with two fundamental scales: $10^{-2}$ eV and $10^{10}$ GeV, which are of geometric origin and, following the Distance Conjecture, natural. Hence, a bridge is established between the two standard models of particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Impact of Low ell's on Large Scale Structure Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the reported lensing anomaly of the CMB by considering several phenomenological modifications of the lensing consistency parameter, $A_{\rm L}$. Considering Planck spectra alone, we find statisically significant evidence for scale dependence (`running') of $A_{\rm L}$. We then demonstrate that the anomaly is entirely driven by Planck's low multipoles, $\ell \leq 30$. When these data points are excluded a joint analysis with several other datasets clearly favors $\Lambda$CDM over the extended $\Lambda \rm CDM+A_L$ model.
  Not only that the lensing anomaly and low $\ell$ anomaly of the CMB go away in this case, but also the $S_8$ tension is ameliorated, and only the Hubble tension persists.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effects of Mass Dependence in Spontaneous Collapse Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous collapse models aim to solve the long-standing measurement problem in quantum mechanics by modifying the theory's dynamics to include objective wave function collapses. These collapses occur randomly in space, bridging the gap between quantum and classical behavior. A central feature of these models is their dependence on mass density, which directly influences how and when collapse events occur. In this work, we explore a generalized framework in which the collapse dynamics depend on arbitrary functions of the mass density, extending previous models. We analyze the theoretical consistency of these generalizations, investigate their predictions, and compare them with experimental data. Our findings show that only a limited range of mass-dependence functions are viable, with significant implications for the future development and empirical testability of collapse-based models. Importantly, they also indicate that a well-justified model denoted here as PSL shows much more resilience to experimental falsification than standard collapse models.</description>

      <title>Scale separation, rolling solutions and entropy bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit scale separation for compactifications of ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity. For cosmological solutions rolling down flux-generated potentials, we observe that scale separation is achieved as time flows, and is fairly generic. This is realized without the need of orientifolds nor corrections to the classical supergravity approximation. We then confront scale separation with the Covariant Entropy Bound (CEB) and the CKN bound. We show that a naive application of these bounds to vacua hints at the existence of at least two extra dimensions. For rolling solutions, we observe that the CEB is not always respected, but since these examples lack a cosmic horizon, the application of entropy bounds remains delicate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic study of the Starobinsky-Higgs inflation model in the presence of an additional cubic term of the Ricci scalar. We investigate, in particular, the effects of the cubic term on the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Through both analytical and numerical analyses, we show that the $R^3$-corrected Starobinsky-Higgs model can achieve compatibility with cosmic microwave background observations while producing distinct observational signatures with different frequency ranges. In addition, we discuss the complementarity between different observational probes, including the scalar-induced gravitational waves and spectral distortions, offering an independent probe of the enhanced curvature perturbations. Detection prospects are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel type of soliton dubbed soft oscillons. In contrast with conventional oscillons the soft counterparts come in a continuum of unboundedly large sizes. They are peculiar also in that the oscillation frequency is set by their size and in their high harmonic content, that leads to a peculiar core structure and pulsating emission of radiation. Soft oscillons appear in a broad class of scalar field theories with plateau potentials and owe their existence to a simple confinement mechanism: a large field perturbation automatically acts as a cavity that traps massless modes. We study the classical evaporation rate, lifetime and stability under anisotropic deformations. Soft oscillons are longer lived in gapless models, where lifetimes can reach 100 times the initial radius or more.</description>

      <title>Violation of NCQ scaling in hadron elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0-7.7GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling of elliptic flow for various hadrons in non-central Au+Au collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.0\text{--}7.7\,\mathrm{GeV}\) using the AMPT model with string melting (SM) and pure hadron cascade (HC) modes. For the SM case, NCQ scaling is absent at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}\) but is largely restored by \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.9\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Although quark coalescence occurs at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the lack of NCQ scaling is attributed to the insufficient development of quark elliptic flow and the limited production of strange quarks and antiquarks. This finding suggests that NCQ scaling could not be considered a definitive signature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in the RHIC fixed-target energy region. For the HC case, as expected, no NCQ scaling is observed. However, a mass ordering in the elliptic flow emerges at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =4.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\), indicating that full thermalization may not be a prerequisite for mass ordering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to usual calculations in quantum field theory, both in flat and curved spacetime, the mass $m^2$ of a scalar particle is quadratically sensitive to the ultimate scale of the theory, the UV physical cutoff $\Lambda$. In the present work, paying attention to the path integral measure and to the way $\Lambda$ is introduced, we calculate the one-loop effective action $\Gamma^{1l}$ for a scalar field on a non-trivial gravitational background. We find that $m^2$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to $\Lambda$. This is obtained without resorting to a supersymmetric embedding of the theory, nor to regularization schemes (as dimensional or zeta-function regularization) where power-like divergences are absent by construction. In view of the results of the present work, we finally speculate on the way the Minkowski limit should be approached.</description>
