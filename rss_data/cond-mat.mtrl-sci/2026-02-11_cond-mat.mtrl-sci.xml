      <title>Fixed-grid sharp-interface numerical solutions to the three-phase spherical Stefan problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many metal manufacturing processes involve phase change phenomena, which include melting, boiling, and vaporization. These phenomena often occur concurrently. A prototypical 1D model for understanding the phase change phenomena is the Stefan problem. There is a large body of literature discussing the analytical solution to the two-phase Stefan problem that describes only the melting or boiling of phase change materials (PCMs) with one moving interface. Density-change effects that induce additional fluid flow during phase change are generally neglected in the literature to simplify the math of the Stefan problem. In our recent work [1], we provide analytical and numerical solutions to the three-phase Stefan problem with simultaneous occurrences of melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation in Cartesian coordinates. Our current work builds on our previous work to solve a more challenging problem: the three-phase Stefan problem in spherical coordinates for finite-sized particles. There are three moving interfaces in this system: the melt front, the boiling front, and the outer boundary which is in contact with the atmosphere. Although an analytical solution could not be found for this problem, we solved the governing equations using a fixed-grid sharp-interface method with second-order spatio-temporal accuracy. Using a small-time analytical solution, we predict a reasonably accurate estimate of temperature (in the three phases) and interface positions and velocities at the start of the simulation. Our numerical method is validated by reproducing the two-phase nanoparticle melting results of Font et al. [2]. Lastly, we solve the three-phase Stefan problems numerically to demonstrate the importance of kinetic energy terms during phase change of smaller (nano) particles. In contrast, these effects diminish for large particles (microns and larger).</description>

      <title>Chiral Polar Eu2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2: A Pathway Toward Narrow Optical Linewidths and Microsecond Lifetimes for Quantum Memory Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stoichiometric materials of Eu(III) offer a promising platform for quantum memories attributable to their unique capability to display a distinctive, nondegenerate J = 0 transition, which enables precise mapping of optical quantum states into their hyperfine structure for reliable storage and retrieval on demand. However, placing Eu(III) into chiral polar structures, which are necessary for achieving narrow spectral linewidths and long optical lifetimes, is a daunting task. Here, we discover Eu2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2, a rare Eu(III) material that exhibits chiral polar symmetries encompassing both local and global structures. This unique structure is shaped by an appropriate combination of asymmetric ligands. The chirality fosters dipole-dipole interactions and J-mixing, as characterized by second-harmonic generation, photoluminescence, and magnetic susceptibility. The broken inversion symmetry is supported by the phase-matching behavior of second-harmonic generation. The J = 0 transition is observed at 578 nm with a narrow linewidth at 78 K and a microsecond-scale optical lifetime. The analysis of magnetic susceptibility data using Van Vleck theory results in an effective magnetic moment of 3.33 {\mu}B/Eu3+ and J-mixing. Heat capacity data reveal underlying phonon dynamics in the material. This study demonstrates a pathway toward realizing new stoichiometric Eu3+ compounds with potential for optically addressable quantum memory applications.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of Water on Pristine Graphene: A van der Waals Density Functional Study with the vdW-C09 Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how water interacts with graphene at the molecular level is essential for advancing nanomaterial applications in filtration, catalysis, and environmental technologies. This study establishes a quantitative baseline for assessing how structural defects, dopants, or surface functionalization may enhance water adsorption, providing insights for the rational design of graphene-based materials in water purification, sensing, and nanofluidic applications. In this work, we employed density functional theory (DFT) with the vdW-C09 functional to investigate the adsorption of a single water molecule on pristine graphene, accurately accounting for long-range dispersion forces. Three high-symmetry adsorption sites-the center of the hexagonal ring, the C-C bond, and the top site-were explored in combination with three molecular orientations: Down, H-bond, and Up configurations. The calculated adsorption energies range from -93 to -145 meV (milli-electron volts), indicating that the interaction is dominated by weak van der Waals forces characteristic of physisorption. The most stable configuration corresponds to the Down orientation above the center of the hexagonal ring, with an adsorption energy of -145 meV and an equilibrium distance of 3.27 A (angstrom), defined as the vertical separation between the oxygen atom of the water molecule and the graphene plane. These results are in close agreement with previous theoretical studies and confirm the non-reactive and hydrophobic nature of pristine graphene.</description>

      <title>Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain engineering, reliable methods of ferroelectricity control are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and/or ferroelectric domains, and appropriate modelling of stress-induced ferroelectric states in the nanoparticles are absent too. In this work we study the influence of chemical stresses on phase diagrams and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, antipolar and nonpolar order parameters. It appeared that the ferroelectric phase can be reentrant with respect to the size of nanoparticles, because the spontaneous polarization exists in the limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min&lt;R_c&lt;R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is mainly determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The maximal critical radius R_cr^max is mainly determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses, which are induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Analytical expressions derived for the critical radii can be generalized for hafnium-zirconium oxide nanoparticles, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Deformation potential driven photostriction in layered ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between electronic excitations and lattice deformation in van der Waals ferroelectrics is governed by a competition between the electron deformation potential and the inverse piezoelectric effect. While theory predicts that piezoelectric screening should drive a polar-axis contraction in monolayer group-IV monochalcogenides, we demonstrate that in multilayer SnS, the deformation potential provides the dominant contribution, driving a polar-axis expansion even within ferroelectric domains. By correlating polarization-resolved second-harmonic generation microscopy with ultrafast reflectance spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we resolve the anisotropic lattice response and disentangle intrinsic photostrictive strain from extrinsic thin-film interference artifacts. These results establish a microscopic hierarchy of photostrictive mechanisms and position stacking-engineered SnS as a platform for ultrafast optomechanical transduction.</description>

      <title>How Far Can You Grow? Characterizing the Extrapolation Frontier of Graph Generative Models for Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every generative model for crystalline materials harbors a critical structure size beyond which its outputs quietly become unreliable -- we call this the extrapolation frontier. Despite its direct consequences for nanomaterial design, this frontier has never been systematically measured. We introduce RADII, a radius-resolved benchmark of ${\sim}$75,000 nanoparticle structures (55-11,298 atoms) that treats radius as a continuous scaling knob to trace generation quality from in-distribution to out-of-distribution regimes under leakage-free splits. RADII provides frontier-specific diagnostics: per-radius error profiles pinpoint each architecture's scaling ceiling, surface-interior decomposition tests whether failures originate at boundaries or in bulk, and cross-metric failure sequencing reveals which aspect of structural fidelity breaks first. Benchmarking five state-of-the-art architectures, we find that: (i) all models degrade by ${\sim}13\%$ in global positional error beyond training radii, yet local bond fidelity diverges wildly across architectures -- from near-zero to over $2\times$ collapse; (ii) no two architectures share the same failure sequence, revealing the frontier as a multi-dimensional surface shaped by model family; and (iii) well-behaved models obey a power-law scaling exponent $\alpha \approx 1/3$ whose in-distribution fit accurately predicts out-of-distribution error, making their frontiers quantitatively forecastable. These findings establish output scale as a first-class evaluation axis for geometric generative models. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/RADII.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Quantum Size Effect and Tensile Strain on Surface Morphology of Sn(100) Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum size effect (QSE) and strain effect are two key factors influencing the surface morphology of thin films, which can increase film surface roughness through QSE-induced thickness oscillation and strain-induced island formation, respectively. Surface roughness usually manifests in the early stages of film growth and diminishes beyond a critical thickness. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow Sn(100) islands with varying thickness N on bilayer graphene-terminated 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements reveal an inverse surface roughness effect that highlights the interplay of QSE and misfit strain in shaping the surface morphology of Sn(100) islands. For N =&lt; 10, the islands exhibit flat surfaces, while for N &gt;= 26, the island surfaces become corrugated and patterned. For the intermediate range, i.e., 12 =&lt; N =&lt;24, both flat and patterned surfaces coexist, with the percentage coverage of the patterned surface oscillating as a function of N. By performing density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the unusual surface pattern evolution in our MBE-grown Sn(100) islands is a result of the interplay between QSE-induced surface roughing and tensile strain-induced smoothening effect.</description>

      <title>Surface-State-Driven Anomalous Hall Effect in Altermagnetic MnTe Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as a new class of magnetic materials that combine compensated magnetic order with spin-split electronic band structures. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow MnTe thin films with controlled thickness on InP(111)A substrates. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, we observe a large spin splitting of ~230 meV for bulk bands well below the Fermi level and identify surface states that cross the Fermi level. Electrical transport measurements reveal that a robust anomalous Hall (AH) effect persists down to 2 K and an AH sign reversal occurs near 175 K. By systematically tuning film thickness, growth conditions, and interfacial structure, we demonstrate that the AH response in MnTe films originates from the Berry curvature of surface states rather than from bulk bands. Our first-principles calculations reveal that this surface-state-driven AH effect is imprinted by the bulk altermagnetic order and remains unchanged for terminations with opposite Mn magnetic orientations. Our results establish a unique surface transport probe of bulk altermagnetism, demonstrate interface engineering as an effective route to generate and control the AH effect in altermagnets, and provide a unified understanding of the AH response in altermagentic MnTe films.</description>

      <title>Nodal-Surface and Flat-Band Driven Large Anomalous Nernst Effect in Epitaxial Ferromagnetic Weyl Metal Fe5Si3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials such as Weyl and Dirac magnets exhibit unconventional electronic properties arising from the interplay between magnetic order and band topology, leading to remarkable thermomagnetic and thermoelectric effects. Here, we investigate the ANE in epitaxial thin films of the Weyl ferromagnet candidate Fe5Si3. A pronounced transverse Nernst response exceeding approximately 1.50 microvolt per kelvin is observed at room temperature, together with a giant anomalous Nernst angle of about 0.56, indicating highly efficient conversion between thermal gradients and transverse electric fields. Beyond the anomalous contribution, a sizable topological Nernst signal of approximately 0.43 microvolt per kelvin persists above room temperature, suggesting the possible presence of real-space Berry curvature associated with nontrivial spin textures. First-principles density functional theory calculations combined with symmetry analysis reveal an unconventional electronic structure in which Weyl nodal lines, nodal surfaces, and nearly flat bands coexist near the Fermi level. This rare concurrence of multiple topological band features produces a strongly enhanced and sharply energy-dependent Berry curvature, which governs both the magnitude and temperature evolution of the observed Nernst response. The close quantitative agreement between calculated anomalous Nernst conductivity and experimental results establishes the topological electronic structure as the dominant origin of the observed thermomagnetic transport, highlighting Fe5Si3 as a chemically simple, low-cost binary topological magnet for exploring both real-space and momentum-space Berry-curvature-driven thermoelectric phenomena.</description>

      <title>Realistic tight-binding model for V2Se2O-family altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following earlier theoretical prediction, intercalated V2Se2O-family altermagnets such as RbV2Te2O and KV2Se2O have now been experimentally confirmed as d-wave altermagnets, representing the only known van der Waals layered altermagnetic systems. By combining crystal-symmetry-paired spin-momentum locking (CSML) with the layered structure, the V2Se2O-family offers a suitable platform for studying low-dimensional spintronic responses and exploring the interplay among multiple quantum degrees of freedom. To establish a concrete theoretical foundation for understanding and utilizing these materials, we investigate six representative members of the V2Se2O-family and construct a realistic tight-binding model parameterized by first-principles calculations, which is benchmarked by experimental measurements. This model accurately captures essential altermagnetic electronic properties, including CSML and noncollinear spin-conserved currents. It further incorporates strain-coupling parameters, enabling the simulation of strain-tunable responses such as the piezo-Hall effects. This realistic model allows systematic exploration of multiple degrees of freedom (like spin, valley, and layer) within a single system, and lays the groundwork for understanding their coupling with other quantum materials, such as topological insulators and superconductors, thereby advancing both the fundamental understanding and potential device applications of this novel class of layered altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Competing magnetic states in a non-coplanar Kagome magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-collinear Kagome antiferromagnets (AFMs) Mn3X (X = Sn, Ga, Ge, Ir, Pt) can generate an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) despite vanishing net magnetization, enabled by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, strong in-plane anisotropy has limited studies of the AFM-AHE and electronic applications to coplanar spin configurations. Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature. Our findings establish a platform for non-coplanar magnetism in AFM spintronics.</description>

      <title>Chiralometer: Direct Torque Detection of Crystal Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality governs phenomena ranging from chemical reactions to the topology of quasiparticle charge carriers. However, a direct macroscopic probe for crystal chirality remains a significant challenge, especially in time reversal symmetric systems with weak circular dichroism signal. Here, we propose the ``Chiralometer'', a mechanical detection method that probes chirality by driving angular momentum carriers out of equilibrium. Using first-principles calculations and semiclassical transport theory, we demonstrate that a temperature gradient in insulators or an electric field in metals induces uncompensated angular momentum in phonons and electrons, respectively. This imbalance generates a macroscopic mechanical torque ($\tau \sim 10^{-11} N \cdot m$) well within the sensitivity of modern torque magnetometry and cantilever-based sensors. We identify robust signatures in chiral crystals such as Te, SiO$_2$, and the topological semimetal CoSi. Our work establishes mechanical torque as a fundamental order parameter for chirality, offering a transformative tool for orbitronics and chiral quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Cavity control of multiferroic order in single-layer NiI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling materials through their interactions with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations is an emergent frontier in material engineering. Although recent experiments have demonstrated dark cavity effects for electronic material phases, like superconductivity, ferroelectricity and charge density waves, a smoking gun experiment for magnetic systems is lacking. Largely, this comes from the focus on phase transitions, where a large critical light-matter coupling is needed to observe cavity modifications. Here, we propose spiral magnets, where even a small cavity-mediated change in magnetic interactions is reflected in a change of the spiral wavelength, as a promising platform to observe cavity effects. We focus on the single-layer multiferroic NiI$_2$, interacting with electric field fluctuations from surface phonon polaritons of the paraelectric substrate SrTiO$_3$. With decreasing substrate-material distance, the ratio of nearest and third nearest neighbor exchange interactions reduces, leading to an increase of the spiral wavelength and an eventual transition into a ferromagnetic state. Our work identifies a realistic platform to observe cavity vacuum renormalization effects in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>High Photovoltaic Efficiency in Bulk-Stacked One-Dimensional GeSe$_{2}$ van der Waals Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium diselenide (GeSe$_{2}$) has recently attracted substantial interest as a rare example of one-dimensional (1D) van der Waals material. Here, we investigate the photovoltaic potential of bulk-stacked GeSe$_{2}$ chains using first-principles calculations within the $GW0$ approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to capture quasiparticle and excitonic effects. The bulk GeSe$_{2}$ exhibits indirect GW band gaps of 1.92 eV (type-I) and 1.08 eV (type-II). Optical calculations show markedly stronger visible-light absorption in type-II, yielding a spectroscopically limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of ~25.6% at a 0.5 $\mu$m thickness. Phonon and room-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics analyses indicate that type-II is dynamically stable, whereas type-I shows imaginary phonon modes, suggesting a propensity for structural distortion. These results identify type-II GeSe2 as a promising stable absorber for thin-film photovoltaics with enhanced flexibility compared to typical 2D vdW systems.</description>

      <title>Microstructural origin of the simultaneous enhancements in strength and ductility of a nitrogen-doped high-entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most abundant interstitial elements, nitrogen (N) is effective in improving yield strength of metallic materials, due to interstitial solid solution strengthening. Doping N can substantially enhance the yield strength but often leads to a decreased ductility, revealing a strength-ductility trade-off phenomenon. Here, we simultaneously enhance the strength and ductility in a non-equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy via N alloying and unravel the underlying microscopic mechanisms. The N-doped alloy (1 at.% N) shows an excellent combination of higher yield strength (104% increase) and larger ductility (38% increase), with a two-stage strain hardening behavior, compared to the N-free alloy. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals that N-doping introduces short-range order (SRO) domains within the microstructure, leads to pronounced planar slip, and promotes the formation of nano-spaced (6-15 nm) stacking faults and deformation twins. Continuous generation and interaction of the fine-spaced SFs act as a strong barrier for dislocation movement and provide ample room for dislocation storage. The interaction of SRO with dislocations and the evolution of SFs ascribe to the first strain hardening stage, and the disordering of the SRO along with the activation of deformation twins are attributed to the second strain hardening stage. Our work shows that N-doping is effective in simultaneously improving the strength-ductility synergy and provides novel insights into alloy design with slightly elevating the SFE, and manipulating the ordered structure within the HEA.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependent topological, superconducting, optoelectronic and thermophysical properties of Ta2Se chalcogenide: Theoretical insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tetragonal Ta2Se is a layered, Ta-rich chalcogenide that departs from conventional MX2 transition-metal dichalcogenides by hosting dense Ta-Ta networks capped by Se square-net layers. Here, we present a unified first-principles investigation of hydrostatic-pressure tuning in Ta2Se from 0 to 10 GPa, connecting the structural response, mechanical stability, thermophysical indicators, bonding evolution, electronic and optical behavior, lattice dynamics and superconductivity within a single framework. The derived thermophysical descriptors corroborate a pressure-stiffened lattice: density increases, Debye temperature rises, melting temperature is elevated and minimum thermal conductivity increases, whereas the Gr\"uneisen parameter remains within a narrow window, suggesting no anomalous anharmonic softening. Bond population metrics and electron-density-difference analysis revealed a mixed metallic-covalent bonding picture dominated by a robust Ta-Ta metallic backbone, accompanied by pressure-strengthened Ta-Se hybridization. Electronic-structure calculations show persistent metallicity under compression; pressure broadens bands, reduces density of states at the Fermi level, reshapes the Fermi surface and points to a possible Lifshitz-type reconstruction without symmetry breaking. The optical response remained metallic with Drude-like low-energy behavior and pressure-tunable spectral features. The phonon dispersions exhibit no imaginary modes, confirming dynamical stability. Electron-phonon coupling calculations classify Ta2Se as a weak-coupling, phonon-mediated superconductor with Tc around 3.9 K, consistent with available experiments and establish pressure as a practical control knob for stability and superconductivity-relevant descriptors in this metal-rich layered platform.</description>

      <title>How Geometry Tames Disorder in Lattice Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fracture behavior of pre-cracked triangular beam-lattices whose elements have failure stresses drawn from a Weibull distribution. Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials.</description>

      <title>Giant thermopower changes related to the resistivity maximum and colossal magnetoresistance in EuCd2P2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the thermopower of EuCd2P2, a material which exhibits a large resistivity peak with significant magnetic field dependence in the temperature range of 10-25 K. In the same region we observe a highly unusual behavior of the thermopower with two sign changes and giant extrema. The overall variation of the thermopower exceeds 4 000 muV/K and takes place in an extremely narrow temperature region of less than 5 K. The anomaly is suppressed completely in a small magnetic field of 0.5 T. We discuss this observation using a simple drift-diffusion picture and taking into account that the temperature gradient inducing the thermopower voltage is accompanied by a gradient of the electrical resistivity. Our simple estimation yields the correct magnitude, shape, and field dependence of the thermopower anomaly observed in EuCd2P2. These results open a new route to giant thermopower values via gradients of electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Exciton fine structure in CdSe nanoplatelets using a quasi-2D screened configuration-interaction framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute exciton binding energies and fine-structure splittings in CdSe nanoplatelets with two zincblende geometries and one wurtzite geometry, finding that the wurtzite structure exhibits the largest bright-bright splitting due to its intrinsic in-plane anisotropy, while the zincblende structures show smaller but finite splittings arising from atomistic symmetry breaking at edges and corners. These results are obtained using a theoretical framework that we developed, which combines DFT single-particle states with screened configuration interaction, a quasi-2D dielectric screening model, and an efficient Coulomb-cutoff scheme that eliminates periodic-image interactions and enables accurate Coulomb and exchange integrals at low computational cost. This methodology provides a transferable and practical route for studying excitons in CdSe nanoplatelets and other quasi-two-dimensional nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Multiple Layer-Selective Polar Charge Density Waves in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ is a polar charge density wave (CDW) material, with giant thermal hysteresis and non-volatile state switching under electric and optical fields, attracting great attention in recent years. However, the in-depth understanding of these anomalous phenomena remains elusive. Herein, via first-principles calculations, we reveal that the polar CDW state in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ hosts a novel layer-selective nature, wherein multiple energetically close CDW configurations coexist and exhibit low interconversion energy barriers. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the giant thermal hysteresis in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ originates from a phase transition mainly driven by the change of configurational entropy, around which the material hosts a metastable CDW state characterized by diverse local polar configurations breaking the out-of-plane translational symmetry. The configurational composition of this metastable CDW state can be effectively controlled by electric and optical fields, thereby enabling non-volatile state switching. Our theoretical findings align well with recent experimental observations in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ and pave the way for exploring the emerging phenomena and applications of polar CDW in multilayered systems.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Machine Learning of Electron Density for Twisted Bilayer Moir\'e Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit rich quantum phenomena, but ab initio modelling of these systems remains computationally prohibitive. Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects. Beyond moir\'e materials, this approach provides a general methodology for electronic structure prediction in large-scale systems with substantial long-range phenomena related to non-local geometric information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical substitution in crystalline quantum materials is a powerful way to explore the consequences of strong spin-orbit coupling on their structural and electronic properties. In this work, we present an investigation of thin films of the La$\textit{Pn}_2$ ($\textit{Pn}$~=~Sb, Bi) class of layered square-net intermetallics. We report the growth of LaBi$_2$ with a pristine layer-by-layer growth mode, classifying it as a good metal displaying superconductivity at $\sim$0.55~K. Compared to LaSb$_2$, we attribute the enhanced metallic behavior and improved growth dynamics of LaBi$_2$ to significant relativistic corrections to its electronic band structure and the resulting impact on both surface energy and intrinsic phonon scattering.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modeling of Metal/Oxide/Metal Conductive Bridging Random Access Memory Cells: from Ab Initio to Finite Element Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale simulation framework to compute the current vs. voltage (I-V ) characteristics of metal/oxide/metal structures building the core of conductive bridging random access memory (CBRAM) cells and to shed light on their resistance switching properties. The approach relies on a finite element model whose input material parameters are extracted either from ab initio or from machine-learned empirical calculations. The applied techniques range from molecular dynamics and nudged elastic band to electronic and thermal quantum transport. Such an approach drastically reduces the number of fitting parameters needed and makes the resulting modeling environment more accurate than traditional ones. The developed computational framework is then applied to the investigation of an Ag/a-SiO2/Pt CBRAM, reproducing experimental data very well. Moreover, the relevance of Joule heating is assessed by considering various cell geometries. It is found that self-heating manifests itself in devices with thin conductive filaments with few-nanometer diameters and at current concentrations in the 10s-microampere range. With the proposed methodology it is now possible to explore the potential of not-yet fabricated memory cells and to reliably optimize their design.</description>

      <title>PySlice: Routine Vibrational Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy Prediction with Universal Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope can reveal phonon excitations with nanometer spatial resolution, yet routine prediction remains out of reach due to fragmented workflows requiring specialized expertise. Here we introduce PySlice, the first publicly available implementation of the Time Autocorrelation of Auxiliary Wavefunction (TACAW) method, providing an automated framework that produces momentum- and energy-resolved vibrational electron energy-loss spectra directly from atomic structures. By integrating universal machine learning interatomic potentials with TACAW, PySlice eliminates the bottleneck of per-system potential development. Users input atomic structures and obtain phonon dispersions, spectral diffraction patterns, and spectrum images through a unified workflow spanning molecular dynamics, GPU-accelerated electron scattering, and frequency-domain analysis. We outline the formulation behind the code, demonstrate its application to canonical systems in materials science, and discuss its use for advanced analysis and materials exploration. The modular Python architecture additionally supports conventional electron microscopy simulations, providing a general-purpose platform for imaging and diffraction calculations. PySlice makes vibrational spectroscopy prediction routine rather than specialized, enabling computational screening for experimental design, systematic exploration of phonon physics across materials families, and high-throughput generation of simulated data for training of future machine learning models.</description>

      <title>A complete phase-field fracture model for brittle materials subjected to thermal shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brittle materials subjected to thermal shocks experience strong temperature gradients that in turn give rise to mechanical stresses that can be large enough to induce fracture. This work presents a complete model for phase-field fracture for coupled thermo-mechanical problems, wherein the bulk material properties, the material strength, and the fracture toughness are specified independently. The capabilities of the model are assessed across a wide span of scenarios in thermo-mechanical fracture, from the propagation of large pre-existing cracks to crack nucleation under spatially uniform states of stress. In particular, we revisit the controlled quenching of glass plates, and demonstrate how the model captures experimentally observed crack patterns across a range of thermal loads. Ceramic disks subjected to infrared radiation are also examined, with the model reproducing both straight cracks in notched specimens and branching in intact specimens. Finally, ceramic pellets subjected to rapid power pulses are examined, with the model explaining experimental transitions from intact to fractured pellets and the important role of material strength. The results demonstrate that the complete phase-field model unifies the treatment of distinct fracture scenarios under thermal shock, surpassing classical approaches and enabling more reliable prediction of brittle fracture in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Reinforcement Learning for Noise resilience in Analog Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog Ising machines (AIMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for combinatorial optimization, utilizing physical dynamics to solve Ising problems with high energy efficiency. However, the performance of traditional optimization and sampling algorithms on these platforms is often limited by inherent measurement noise. We introduce BRAIN (Boltzmann Reinforcement for Analog Ising Networks), a distribution learning framework that utilizes variational reinforcement learning to approximate the Boltzmann distribution. By shifting from state-by-state sampling to aggregating information across multiple noisy measurements, BRAIN is resilient to Gaussian noise characteristic of AIMs. We evaluate BRAIN across diverse combinatorial topologies, including the Curie-Weiss and 2D nearest-neighbor Ising systems. We find that under realistic 3\% Gaussian measurement noise, BRAIN maintains 98\% ground state fidelity, whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods degrade to 51\% fidelity. Furthermore, BRAIN reaches the MCMC-equivalent solution up to 192x faster under these conditions. BRAIN exhibits $\mathcal{O}(N^{1.55})$ scaling up to 65,536 spins and maintains robustness against severe measurement uncertainty up to 40\%. Beyond ground state optimization, BRAIN accurately captures thermodynamic phase transitions and metastable states, providing a scalable and noise-resilient method for utilizing analog computing architectures in complex optimizations.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian stealthy hyperuniformity</title>

Abstract: Symmetry-driven wave physics in open systems, exemplified by parity-time (PT) symmetry, has extended the landscape of crystalline phases in materials science to include gain-loss media. Given the growing interest in engineering disorder for wave manipulation, such non-Hermitian crystals motivate the extension of non-Hermitian frameworks into the realm of correlated disorder. Here, we propose hyperuniformity and stealthiness in non-Hermitian systems as a generalization of PT-symmetric crystals to correlated disorder. We extend the scattering-microstructure correspondence to open systems, formulating non-Hermitian hyperuniformity and stealthiness that encompass their Hermitian counterparts. This approach, incorporating a statistical crystallography framework for non-Hermitian materials, demonstrates that real-imaginary cross-correlations of the material potential are irrelevant for achieving hyperuniformity but are essential for characterizing stealthiness, revealing unidirectional scattering phases that are inaccessible in Hermitian materials and in non-Hermitian crystals. By analysing the microstructural statistics of the resulting materials, our results, building on non-Hermitian wave physics, establish a connection to materials science, encompassing conventional descriptors of correlated disorder.</description>

      <title>Origin of Moir\'{e} Potentials in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ Heterobilayers: Contributions from Lattice Reconstruction and Interlayer Charge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'{e} superlattices formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers have emerged as an exciting platform to explore the quantum many-body physics. The key mechanism is the introduction of moir\'{e} potentials for the band-edge carriers induced by the lateral modulation of interlayer interactions. This trapping potential results in the formation of flat bands, which enhances the strong correlation effect. However, a full understanding of the origin of this intriguing potential remains elusive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the origin of moir\'{e} potentials in both R-type and H-type moir\'{e} patterns formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. We show that both lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer contribute significantly to the formation of moir\'{e} potentials. In particular, the lattice reconstruction induces a nonuniform local strain, which creates an energy modulation of 200 meV for the conduction band-edge state located at WS$_2$ layer and 20 meV for the valence band-edge state located at WSe$_2$ layer. In addition, the lattice reconstruction also introduces a piezopotential energy, whose amplitude ranges from 40 meV to 90 meV depending on the stacking and band-edge carrier. The interlayer charge transfer induces a built-in electric field, resulting in an energy modulation of 80 meV for an R-type moir\'{e} and 40 meV for an H-type moir\'{e}. Taking into account both effects from lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer, the formation of moir\'{e} potential is well understood for both R-type and H-type moir\'{e}s. This trapping potential localizes the wavefunctions of conduction and valence bands around the same moir\'{e} site for an R-type moir\'{e}, while around different moir\'{e} site for an H-type one.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory of spin waves by lattice dislocation defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin-wave propagation in magnetic insulators in the presence of lattice dislocations. Within a continuum magnetoelastic framework, we show that the strain fields generated by dislocations induce equilibrium magnetic textures. The morphology of these textures depends sensitively on the dislocation type and acts as a localized scattering potential for spin-wave excitations. As a result, the scattering response exhibits pronounced asymmetries and interference effects governed by the magnetoelastic coupling and the dislocation type. By combining numerical simulations with analytical scattering theory, we compute differential cross sections and frequency-dependent transmission coefficients. Furthermore, analysis of the effective potential landscape reveals that the defect forms a barrier that modulates spin-wave transport and, crucially, breaks the intrinsic reflectionless nature of magnetic domain walls. Our findings identify lattice dislocations as tunable scattering centers, opening new avenues for defect engineering in magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Background-free Tracking of Ultrafast Hole and Electron Dynamics with XUV Transient Grating Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption (TA) and transient reflectivity (TR) spectroscopies enable element-specific insights into attosecond-timescale processes in solids. XUV transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) is an emerging tool that combines the advantages of both absorption and reflectivity while offering intrinsically background-free detection. Here, we implement XUV-TGS by generating a transient grating in germanium solid using two few-cycle near-infrared pulses and probing it with an attosecond XUV pulse, produced via tabletop high-harmonic generation. The spectrally resolved, diffracted XUV pulses directly visualize the separate ultrashort decay times of both photoexcited electrons and holes, without the need for iterative deconvolution. By combining XUV-TA and -TG spectroscopy, we extract the evolution of the complex refractive index, \~n, without the need for Kramers-Kronig reconstruction, as required in XUV-TR, allowing us to extract the roots of the induced optical response. We find reflectivity changes of up to 34% via the real part of \~n, whereas changes in the imaginary part only result in a variation in reflectivity of around 0.5%.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of Room-temperature Stair-stepped Quantum Spin Hall States in Bi4Br4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators host exotic quantum phenomena such as the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, which enables dissipationless one-dimensional edge conduction. Realizing such states at room temperature and on a macroscopic scale is essential for energy-efficient electronics and quantum technologies, yet remains a fundamental challenge due to material limitations. Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in {\alpha}-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high. Magnetic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm their intrinsic topological nature. Crucially, the SS-QSH and bulk signals scale with nanowire height, verifying the stair stepped origin. Our results are also successfully reproduced by finite-element analysis simulations. This work establishes {\alpha} Bi4Br4 as a practical platform for high temperature topological electronics and demonstrates a generalizable stacking strategy for designing scalable QSH systems.</description>

      <title>A 4D-STEM Tomographic Framework Assisted by Object Tracking for Nanoparticle Structure Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has emerged as a powerful method for solving the structures of sub-micron-sized particles down to nanoparticles. However, it faces technical challenges when applied to beam-sensitive samples or conglomerated and agglomerated nanoparticles. This study presents a novel approach that combines 4D-STEM tomography with object tracking and segmentation algorithms to overcome these limitations and achieve single-crystalline 3D ED datasets from nanopowder samples. The method and data quality are assessed on brookite TiO2 nanorods and beam-sensitive CsPbBr3 nanoparticles. To finely sample the reciprocal-space, the data acquisition was automated to acquire hundreds of 4D-STEM scans using a slightly convergent beam and at fine tilt steps. The proposed method provides enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, low illumination time for reducing beam damage, and the ability to analyze multiple particles from a single tomographic dataset. The procedure is optimized to be feasible using commercially available desktops and detectors. This extends the method applicability in the community to the systems and samples that were previously inaccessible for conventional 3D ED methods, particularly breaking the technical challenges for the data acquisition.</description>

      <title>Refined DFT recipe and renormalisation of band-edge parameters for electrons in monolayer MoS$_2$ informed by the measured spin-orbit splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conduction band-edge spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides determines a competition between bright and dark excitons and sets conditions for spintronics applications of these semiconductors. Here, we report the SOS measurement for electrons in monolayer MoS$_2$, found from the threshold density, $n_*$, for the upper spin-orbit-split band population, which exceeds by an order of magnitude the values expected from the conventional density functional theory (DFT). Theoretically, half of the observed value can be attributed to the exchange enhancement of SOS in a finite-density electron gas, but explaining the rest requires refining the DFT approach. As the conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$ is set by a delicate balance between the contribution of sulphur $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals and $d_{z^2}-d_{xz}$ and $d_{z^2}-d_{yz}$ mixing in molybdenum, we use a DFT+U+V framework for fine-tuning the orbital composition of the relevant band-edge states. An optimised choice of Hubbard U/V parameters produces close agreement with the experimentally observed conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$, simultaneously resulting in the valence-band SOS and the quasi-particle band gap which are closer to their values established in the earlier-published experiments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Hydrogen and Oxygen Interstitial Defects in Crystalline Si cells: Mechanism of Device Degradation in Humid Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline through moisture-induced degradation (MID) involving multiple mechanisms including encapsulant hydrolysis and metal ion migration. Among these mechanisms, the role of water-derived hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects represents an underexplored yet fundamental degradation pathway. This study employs density functional theory and quantum transport theory to investigate hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects as a novel perspective for understanding MID mechanisms. Results reveal that neutral hydrogen interstitials at bond-center sites exhibit low diffusion barriers (0.96 eV) and act as deep-level recombination centers, while oxygen interstitials face higher diffusion barriers (2.2 eV) with limited trapping capability. Device simulations demonstrate that hydrogen defects cause substantially more pronounced photovoltaic current degradation through enhanced non-radiative recombination. Critically, under humid conditions, hydrogen from water molecules readily penetrates silicon lattices forming active recombination centers, while oxygen incorporation remains kinetically limited with negligible impact. This interstitial defect perspective provides novel understanding of MID mechanisms, explaining why moisture exposure primarily degrades silicon solar cells through hydrogen rather than oxygen incorporation, offering fundamental insights for developing targeted mitigation strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the inertial dynamics of magnetic skyrmions driven by circularly polarized light (CPL) via the inverse Faraday effect (IFE). By incorporating an inertial mass term into the Thiele equation and analytically deriving the optically induced magnetic fields and forces, we demonstrate fundamentally distinct dynamical regimes under continuous-wave (CW) versus pulsed excitation. Skyrmion inertia qualitatively transforms trajectories from smooth spirals to polygonal orbits under continuous driving, while enabling sustained post-pulse gyration that reveals the system's intrinsic relaxation dynamics. The handedness of the trajectory is determined by the topological charge and light helicity: left-circularly polarized (LCP) light attracts skyrmions toward the beam center, while right-circularly polarized (RCP) light repels them. Systematic parameter analysis reveals how Gilbert damping, optical intensity, frequency, and skyrmion mass control the transition between oscillatory and overdamped dynamical phases. Our work identifies inertia, topological charge, and light helicity as essential factors in ultrafast all-optical skyrmion manipulation and provides a theoretical model for designing topological spin textures with ultrafast light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report transient highly strained structural states in individual palladium (Pd) nanocrystals, electronically heated using an optical laser, which precede their uniform thermal expansion. Using an X-ray free-electron laser probe, the evolution of individual 111 Bragg peaks is measured as a function of delay time at various laser fluences. Above a laser fluence threshold at a sufficient pump-probe delay, the Bragg peak splits into multiple peaks, indicating heterogeneous strain, before returning to a single peak, corresponding to even heat distribution throughout the lattice expanded crystal. Our findings are supported by a lattice displacement and strain model of a single nanocrystal at different delay times, which agrees with the experimental data. Our observations have implications for understanding femtosecond laser interactions with metals and the potential photo-catalytic performance of Pd.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of new battery materials, particularly novel cathode chemistries, is essential for enabling next generation energy storage technologies. In this work, we employ a multi-fidelity screening protocol combining the Energy-GNoME confident criteria, foundational MACE machine-learning force fields (MLFF), and physically motivated heuristic filters to identify novel intercalation cathodes for post-lithium batteries, namely: Na-, K-, Mg-, and Ca-ion batteries. Foundational MACE models are used to efficiently asses dynamical stability, thermodynamical stability, average voltage, and theoretical specific energy, enabling a rapid screening of candidates. For the most promising cathodes, voltage predictions are refined using DFT+U calculations. This work delivers three key outcomes: i) establishing and validating a robust high-throughput screening approach for cathode materials with foundational MLFF models; ii) suggestions for cathode candidates for the development of next-generation of batteries; iii) a fair comparison between the MACE predictions and the readily available figures of merit reported in the Energy-GNoME database on the examined materials.</description>

Abstract: First-principles DFT calculations on the hydrides Ca2NiH6, Sr2NiH6, and Ba2NiH6 reveal key thermodynamic properties. These compounds exhibit increasing entropy and heat capacity with temperature, and are thermodynamically stable at elevated temperatures due to negative free energies. The kinetics of hydrogen storage is influenced by entropy changes during hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Optically, Ba2NiH6 shows a high refractive index at low energies. Mechanical assessments indicate Sr2NiH6 is incompressible with moderate malleability, Ca2NiH6 has the highest resistance to deformation, while Ba2NiH6 is most compressible. Formation energies and hydrogen storage capacities (4.005 wt% for Ca2NiH6, 2.548 wt% for Sr2NiH6, and 1.750 wt% for Ba2NiH6) highlight Ca2NiH6 as the most promising candidate for hydrogen storage technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaining insight into the interaction between flexible piezoelectric structures and ocean waves can inform the development of compact, high-efficiency wave-energy converters that harvest renewable energy from the marine environment. In this paper, the problem of wave energy absorption by floating and submerged piezoelectric plates is investigated. The equations of motion for a plate consisting of two piezoelectric layers separated by an elastic substrate are derived in dimensional form from the full piezoelectric constitutive laws. A solution using a modal expansion method is proposed, in which the component radiation and diffraction problems are reduced to hypersingular integral equations and solved numerically using a constant panel method. The method is general and can solve the equations of motion for submerged rigid, flexible elastic or flexible piezoelectric plates. Extensive numerical results for the energy absorption and efficiency are given for a range of parameters, including different piezoelectric materials: polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT-5H). Importantly, greater energy absorption is obtained for submerged plates when compared to plates floating on the surface. Furthermore, clamped boundary conditions give slightly larger energy absorption compared to the simply supported case.

      <title>Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Predictive Modeling of Illumination-Dependent Current-Voltage Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning enables rapid estimation of material parameters in solar cells via neural-network-based surrogate models. However, the reliability of extracted parameters depends on underlying assumptions such as the choice of one-dimensional drift-diffusion model and selection of free material parameters. To validate the inferred parameters, we perform predictive modeling of light-intensity-dependent current-voltage (JV) characteristics. Well-known physical effects, including the influence of external resistance and recombination dynamics on illumination-dependent device performance, are reflected in parameter estimation and prediction workflow. We show that correct treatment of dark shunt resistance and emphasizing shifted current (J + Jsc) during fitting enhances prediction accuracy at low to intermediate illumination level. Additionally, we analyze the information content of various input JV curve combinations, demonstrating that including at least one illuminated JV, preferably not under high illumination due to series resistance effects, is critical for reliable parameter estimation and device performance prediction.</description>

      <title>The impact of spurious imaginary phonon modes on thermal properties of Metal-organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient and Interpretable Inverse Materials Design using a Disentangled Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse materials design has proven successful in accelerating novel material discovery. Many inverse materials design methods use unsupervised learning where a latent space is learned to offer a compact description of materials representations. A latent space learned this way is likely to be entangled, in terms of the target property and other properties of the materials. This makes the inverse design process ambiguous. Here, we present a semi-supervised learning approach based on a disentangled variational autoencoder to learn a probabilistic relationship between features, latent variables and target properties. This approach is data efficient because it combines all labelled and unlabelled data in a coherent manner, and it uses expert-informed prior distributions to improve model robustness even with limited labelled data. It is in essence interpretable, as the learnable target property is disentangled out of the other properties of the materials, and an extra layer of interpretability can be provided by a post-hoc analysis of the classification head of the model. We demonstrate this new approach on an experimental high-entropy alloy dataset with chemical compositions as input and single-phase formation as the single target property. High-entropy alloys were chosen as example materials because of the vast chemical space of their possible combinations of compositions and atomic configurations. While single property is used in this work, the disentangled model can be extended to customize for inverse design of materials with multiple target properties.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Dome in $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ Thin Films</title>

Abstract: The ambient-pressure superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films via compressive epitaxial strain provides a highly accessible platform for diverse characterization techniques, facilitating the studies of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we systematically map the phase diagram and reveal the superconducting dome with an electron-hole crossover in compressively strained $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ thin films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content. The maximum transition temperature (${T}_{c}$) coincides with an anomalous sign change in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates, which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and ${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity in nickelate systems.</description>

      <title>Fluorine-substitution-dependent phase diagram and superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictides synthesized by a high-pressure growth technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples (x = 0.05 to 0.40) are synthesized by an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure technique at 4 GPa and systematically characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. Structural analysis confirms that the tetragonal Sm1111 phase remains dominant across the entire substitution range, with lattice parameters decreasing smoothly as fluorine content increases, demonstrating effective incorporation of F even in the overdoped regime (x = 0.4). Raman spectroscopy provides complementary, local-phase-sensitive evidence that supports the structural analysis and confirms fluorine substitution in the main Sm1111 phase. In the underdoped region, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude compared with conventionally synthesized samples at the ambient pressure. The upper critical field, estimated using the WHH model, reaches values approaching 200 T, reflecting strong paramagnetic limitation and multiband effects. TAFF analysis reveals a power-law field dependence of the activation energy, consistent with collective vortex pinning in polycrystalline iron-based superconductors. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. Comparison with conventionally synthesized Sm1111 samples demonstrates that high-pressure growth significantly extends the effective fluorine substitution range and enhances the superconducting performance, particularly in the underdoped regime. These results establish high-pressure fluorine substitution as an effective materials-engineering approach for tuning the phase diagram and optimizing the superconducting properties of Sm1111.</description>

      <title>From Disorder to Function: Entropy-Engineered Broadband Photonics with Ion-Transport-Stabilized Spectral Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-entropy halide-perovskite field has expanded rapidly, yet a key gap remains: configurational entropy is not yet a reliable, designable lever to co-deliver expanded photonic functionality and operational robustness with a composition-transferable mechanistic basis. Here we develop entropy-engineered rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb, RE)Cl6 (RE3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), that simultaneously expand near-infrared (NIR) functionality and establish a mechanistic stability rule. Near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase high-entropy solid solution (Delta_Sconfig about 1.6R). Sb3+ serves as a sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide channels, transforming the parent single-mode response into a broadband NIR output (~850-1600 nm) with three spectrally orthogonal fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced output enables redundancy-based ratiometric solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing with reduced susceptibility to intensity drift. Accelerated aging under humidity and oxygen shows improved phase and emission stability versus single-component analogues. DFT and molecular dynamics attribute the robustness to strongly suppressed RE$^{3+}$/Cl$^-$ self-diffusion despite comparable H$_2$O/O$_2$ adsorption, kinetically impeding ion-migration-assisted reconstruction and degradation. Integration into a phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, broadband NIR illumination, establishing entropy engineering as a practical handle to couple expanded photonic functionality with mechanistically accountable durability in metal-halide photonics.</description>

      <title>diffpy.morph: Python tools for model independent comparisons between sets of 1D functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: diffpy.morph addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways. A powerful approach for this is to take differences between pairs of spectra and look for meaningful changes that might indicate underlying chemical, structural, or other modifications. The challenge is that the difference curve may contain uninteresting differences such as experimental inconsistencies and benign physical changes such as the effects of thermal expansion. diffpy.morph allows researchers to apply simple transformations, or "morphs", to one of the datasets to remove the unwanted differences revealing, when they are present, non-trivial differences. diffpy.morph is an open-source Python package available on the Python Package Index and conda-forge. Here, we describe its functionality and apply it to solve a range of experimental challenges on diffraction and PDF data from x-rays and neutrons, though we note that it may be applied to any 1D function in principle.</description>

      <title>MSP-LLM: A Unified Large Language Model Framework for Complete Material Synthesis Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Material synthesis planning (MSP) remains a fundamental and underexplored bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery, as it requires not only identifying suitable precursor materials but also designing coherent sequences of synthesis operations to realize a target material. Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.</description>
