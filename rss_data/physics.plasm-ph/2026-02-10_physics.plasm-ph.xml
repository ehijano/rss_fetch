      <title>Topological Arrest of Ballooning Modes in Non-Axisymmetric Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear ballooning instabilities in non-axisymmetric equilibria exhibit spatial localization along field lines that mirrors Anderson localization in disordered lattices. We demonstrate that this localization fundamentally alters nonlinear stability, transforming a global ballooning crash into a connectivity phase transition on a Ginzburg-Landau network. We identify a dimensionless number, denoted by {\eta}c, as a topological threshold derived from continuum percolation theory. Below this threshold, global instability is topologically arrested as isolated scintillations, providing a rigorous explanation for the robust, benign saturation observed in experiments. Above this threshold, a spanning cluster path forms, unlocking rapid and potentially disruptive nonlinear growth.</description>

      <title>2DESR: a two-dimensional Fourier-space gyrokinetic eigenvalue code for the ion-temperature-gradient modes in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional (2D) gyrokinetic eigenvalue solver, 2DESR, has been developed to solve the 2D gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem in the poloidal Fourier space for the ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) modes in tokamaks. With full kinetic effects of ions retained, the 2D gyrokinetic eigenvalue equations in the poloidal Fourier space have been derived and numerically solved in the 2DESR code. In the linear ITG Cyclone test with adiabatic electrons, the 2DESR code benchmarks well against the gyrokinetic initial-value codes GENE and NLT. It is found that two branches of ITG modes coexist in the system.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of Open Research Information Infrastructures using NLP driven full-text Scientometrics: A case study of the LXCat open-access platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open research information (ORI) play a central role in shaping how scientific knowledge is produced, disseminated, validated, and reused across the research lifecycle. While the visibility of such ORI infrastructures is often assessed through citation-based metrics, in this study, we present a full-text, natural language processing (NLP) driven scientometric framework to systematically quantify the impact of ORI infrastructures beyond citation counts, using the LXCat platform for low temperature plasma (LTP) research as a representative case study. The modeling of LTPs and interpretation of LTP experiments rely heavily on accurate data, much of which is hosted on LXCat, a community-driven, open-access platform central to the LTP research ecosystem. To investigate the scholarly impact of the LXCat platform over the past decade, we analyzed a curated corpus of full-text research articles citing three foundational LXCat publications. We present a comprehensive pipeline that integrates chemical entity recognition, dataset and solver mention extraction, affiliation based geographic mapping and topic modeling to extract fine-grained patterns of data usage that reflect implicit research priorities, data practices, differential reliance on specific databases, evolving modes of data reuse and coupling within scientific workflows, and thematic evolution. Importantly, our proposed methodology is domain-agnostic and transferable to other ORI contexts, and highlights the utility of NLP in quantifying the role of scientific data infrastructures and offers a data-driven reflection on how open-access platforms like LXCat contribute to shaping research directions. This work presents a scalable scientometric framework that has the potential to support evidence based evaluation of ORI platforms and to inform infrastructure design, governance, sustainability, and policy for future development.</description>

      <title>Azimuthally polarized terahertz radiation generation using radially polarized laser pulse in magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical formulation of a radially polarized laser pulse propagating in a homogeneous, magnetized plasma is presented using Lorentz force, continuity and Maxwells equations. Perturbation technique and quasi-static approximation (QSA) have been used to study the generated fields in nonlinear regime. The generated slow, oscillating, transverse electric and magnetic fields having equal amplitude, constitute a radiation field having frequency in the terahertz (THz) range. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation code FBPIC is used to validate analytical findings. Simulation studies also show that the generated THz radiation field propagates beyond the plasma boundary, indicating coherent electromagnetic radiation emission. Furthermore, the field amplitude scales nonlinearly with plasma density and increases linearly with external magnetic field strength, highlighting the role of these parameters in controlling radiation amplitude.</description>

      <title>JOREK simulations of the X-point radiator formation and its movement in ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future large-scale magnetic confinement fusion reactors require operational regimes that can avoid extreme heat fluxes onto the plasma-facing components. One promising regime is the X-point radiator (XPR), which relies on a highly radiative, cold and dense plasma volume forming above the X-point, and which can be accessed via impurity seeding. Experimentally, the height of the XPR can be controlled by adjusting the seeding rate and heating power. This contribution presents axisymmetric (2D) simulations of the XPR regime in ASDEX Upgrade using the nonlinear MHD code JOREK extended with a kinetic particle framework for the main species neutrals and nitrogen impurities. With the time-dependent simulations, the progression from attached divertors to a complete detachment with the XPR formation is shown, highlighting the effects of the neutrals and impurities separately. Amidst this progression, the formation and the loss of the high-field-side high-density are observed. After the XPR is well-formed at the height of 6.8 cm, the fuelling and seeding rates are adjusted so that the XPR remains stationary. From the stationary case, the seeding rate is then changed to see how the XPR location reacts. By increasing and decreasing the seeding rate, the XPR responds by moving upwards and downwards, respectively. These simulations show JOREK's capability of simulating time-varying XPR, which will provide a baseline for the transition to 3D simulations, so the MHD activities and their interaction with the XPR can be studied.</description>

      <title>Preprint: Sheath thickness measurements with the biased plasma impedance probe, Agreement with Child Langmuir scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma sheaths play a central role in plasma-surface interactions, yet their thickness remains challenging to measure experimentally. Although classical analytical models such as the Child-Langmuir (CL) sheath model provide clear predictions for sheath thickness, experimental validation has been limited because most diagnostics either rely on indirect, multi-step inference (e.g., Langmuir probes) or require invasive and technically demanding techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that the plasma impedance probe (PIP), when operated with a controlled DC bias, enables relatively direct, model-informed measurements of sheath thickness that are reasonably straightforward to implement experimentally. Across a range of discharge conditions, biased-PIP sheath thickness measurements are found to follow CL scaling closely, requiring a single, consistent empirical correction factor of $\alpha \approx 0.74$ to reconcile the measured thickness with CL predictions. Concurrent measurements of plasma density and electron damping show that probe biasing does not significantly perturb the bulk plasma density, supporting the validity of the biased-PIP approach. Building on this validation, we leverage the empirically determined $\alpha$ factor to extend the floating (unbiased) PIP analysis to obtain model-dependent estimates of electron temperature and plasma potential without electrical biasing. A side-by-side comparison demonstrates close agreement between floating-PIP results and those obtained from a biased Langmuir probe. Taken together, these results establish the PIP as a complementary diagnostic to the Langmuir probe, expanding the range of accessible plasma measurements while providing experimental support for classical sheath models.</description>

      <title>Weak and reversed magnetic shear effects on internal kink and fishbone modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced tokamak scenarios often feature weak or reversed magnetic shear configurations. In this study, the hybrid kinetic-MHD model implemented in the NIMROD code is used to investigate the effects of reversed magnetic shear on internal kink and fishbone mode in a circular shaped limiter tokamak. In the absence of energetic particles (EPs), the mode growth rate initially increases and then decreases as the magnetic shear changes from positive to negative, indicating stabilizing effects of the reversed magnetic shear on the internal kink mode. In the presence of EPs, when the reversed magnetic shear region is sufficiently narrow, the transition from internal kink/fishbone modes to double kink/fishbone modes takes place, and the stabilizing effects of the reversed magnetic shear can significantly dominate the destabilization of EPs. For non-resonant modes, the EP beta fraction $\beta_f$ for excitation increases with $q_{min}$, concurrent with progressively lower growth rates in non-resonant fishbone modes. When the equilibrium profile has an internal transport barrier (ITB), broader ITB widths suppress internal kink modes more effectively, whereas steeper temperature gradients strengthen EP stabilization.</description>

      <title>FPIC: a new Particle-In-Cell code for stationary and axisymmetric black-hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a newly developed GRPIC code framework called FPIC, providing a detailed description of the Maxwell-equations solver, of the particle ``pushers'', and of the other algorithms that are needed in this approach. We describe in detail the code, which is written in Fortran and exploits parallel architectures using MPI directives both for the fields and particles. FPIC adopts spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, which encode the overall spherical topology of the problem while remaining regular at the event horizon. The Maxwell equations are evolved using a finite-difference time-domain solver with a leapfrog scheme, while multiple particle ``pushers'' are implemented for the evolution of the particles. In addition to well-known algorithms, we introduce a novel hybrid method that dynamically switches between the most appropriate scheme based on the violation of the Hamiltonian energy. We first present results for neutral particles orbiting around black holes, both in the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, monitoring the evolution of the Hamiltonian error across different integration schemes. We apply our hybrid approach, showing that it is capable of achieving improved energy conservation at reduced computational cost. We apply FPIC to investigate the Wald solution, first in electrovacuum and subsequently in plasma-filled configurations. In the latter case, particles with negative energy at infinity are present inside the ergosphere, indicating that the Penrose process is active. Finally, we present the split-monopole solution in a plasma-filled environment and successfully reproduce the Blandford-Znajek luminosity, finding very good agreement with analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability with Anisotropic Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).</description>

      <title>The Role of Phase and Spatial Modes in Wave-Induced Plasma Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a two-dimensional symplectic map for particle motion at the plasma edge by modeling the electrostatic potential as a superposition of integer spatial harmonics with relative phase shift, then reduce it to a two-wave model to study the transport dependence on the perturbation amplitudes, relative phase, and spatial-mode choice. Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17288v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic equilibrium reconstruction is a crucial simulation capability for interpreting diagnostic measurements of experimental plasmas. Equilibrium reconstruction has mostly been applied to systems with isotropic pressure and relatively low plasma $\beta = 2\mu_0p/B^2$. This work extends nonlinear equilibrium reconstruction to high-$\beta$ plasmas with anisotropic pressure and applies it to the Wisconsin High Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror experiments to infer the presence of sloshing ions. A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions with uncertainty quantification to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $\beta$. In addition to WHAM and other mirrors, such reconstruction techniques are potentially attractive in high-performance devices with constrained diagnostic capabilities such as fusion power plants.</description>

      <title>A flexible and differentiable coil proxy for stellarator equilibrium optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balancing plasma performance and coil cost is a significant challenge when designing a stellarator power plant. Most current stellarator designs are produced by two-stage optimization: stage-1 for the equilibrium and stage-2 for a coil design that reproduces its magnetic configuration. Because few proxies connect both stages, two-stage optimization can produce plasmas that have high-quality physical properties but overly complex coils. In recent years, single-stage optimization is increasingly used to optimize the plasma and coils simultaneously, in order to improve the plasma-coil balance. However, all existing single-stage tools are specialized for filament coils, cannot model coil systems containing permanent magnets (PM) or dipole arrays, and remain challenged by numerical problems.The quasi-single-stage (QSS) optimization finds a middle-ground by integrating a coil optimization subproblem into stage-1 optimization. We present a flexible, differentiable coil complexity proxy based on the newly developed QUADCOIL coil optimization code. QUADCOIL is fast and can target realistic coil metrics and constraints that are unavailable to codes with comparable speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the QUADCOIL proxy by presenting two QSS optimization studies. The first study produces a permanent magnet solution for the MUSE stellarator with 29% fewer magnets than previous solutions. The second study produces a coil solution for the ARIES-CS stellarator with approx 30% reductions in both peak and average coil force.</description>

      <title>Unified Model of Heated Plasma Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to predict plasma density and temperature distributions created in the early stages of high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, we develop a fluid model of plasma expansion into vacuum that incorporates external heating. We propose a new three-parameter family of self-similar solutions for plasma expansion that models a wide range of spatiotemporal variations of the electron temperature. Depending on the relative scales of the heated plasma domain $L$, the Debye length $\lambda_D$ and an emergent ion-acoustic correlation length $\lambda_s$, characterized by the parameters $\frac{\lambda_s}{\lambda_D}$ and $\frac{L}{\lambda_s}$, a spectrum of dynamical behaviors for the expanding plasma are identified. The behavior is classified into five dynamical regimes, ranging from nearly quasineutral expansion to the formation of bare ion slabs susceptible to Coulomb explosion. Self-similar solutions with spatially uniform electron temperature with exponential time dependence are analyzed, and the dynamics in the five asymptotic limits in the parameter space are detailed. Scaling relations for the length scales and energies of the expanding plasma are proposed. The self-similar framework is applied to laser-plasma interactions, specifically addressing the plasma dynamics at a target surface as the target interacts with the rising laser intensity envelope. The results offer insights into the expansion behavior based on the laser-plasma parameters, and scaling relations for optimizing laser-plasma schemes and guiding experimental designs in high-intensity laser experiments.</description>

Abstract: Microscale turbulence drives not only particle and heat transport but also energy exchange between different particle species. Previous local gyrokinetic studies have shown that turbulent energy exchange can exceed collisional exchange in weakly collisional plasmas, and that ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence may hinder ion heating by alpha-heated electrons. In addition, it has been clarified that trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence transfers energy from electrons to ions, thereby enhancing ion heating. In this work, we extend these studies by examining the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles at a steady state using the one-dimensional transport solver GOTRESS. For the case of DIII-D discharge 128913 [A. E. White et al., Phys. Plasmas 15, 056116 (2008)], turbulent energy exchange has minimal influence on temperature profiles. However, in the case of enhanced electron heating in a DIIID like tokamak plasma, energy transfer from hot electrons to cold ions driven by TEM turbulence becomes comparable to, or even exceeds, the collisional contribution, leading to a significant increase in the ion temperature profile. For ITER Baseline and SPARC standard H-mode scenarios [N.T. Howard et al., Nucl. Fusion 65, 016002(2024), P. Rodriguez Fernandez et al., J. Plasma Phys. 86, 865860503(2020)], the turbulent energy exchange is largely compensated by the collisional one, producing only small effects. These results indicate that the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles in steady state conditions of future fusion reactor scenarios is expected to be negligibly small, although it can become significant in situations such as plasma start up phases, where the heating power is strongly unbalanced between electrons and ions.</description>

      <title>Charge transport and mode transition in dual-energy electron beam diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11290</link>

Abstract: This Letter uncovers five distinct charge transport modes and their transitions in dual-energy electron beam diodes. We via first-principle particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations establish that the specific mode (e.g., space charge oscillations) and the current transport characteristics are essentially governed by the interplay between the electron beam energy and injected current density. A generalized analysis is conducted for n-component electron beams, and a theoretical piecewise function is for the transmitted current density proposed, which agrees well with the PIC results under designed conditions. The discovery provides a mechanistic picture of multiple electron beam transport in diodes, paving the way for novel designs of high-performance modern vacuum electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Magnetic Structures in the Small-Scale Turbulent Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The small-scale turbulent dynamo is a key mechanism for amplifying galactic magnetic fields, yet the resulting field morphology remains poorly understood. Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures, and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with both analytical models and polarisation observations.</description>

      <title>A DSMC method for the space homogeneous multispecies Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the spatially homogeneous multispecies Landau-Fokker-Planck equation. The scheme is derived from a first-order approximation of the multispecies Boltzmann operator in the grazing collision limit and employs a regularized, easy-to-sample scattering kernel that removes the need for iterative solvers while preserving the fundamental invariants of the Landau dynamics. The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \approx 1836$. We validate the method against the multispecies BKW benchmark for Maxwellian interactions and study collisional relaxation for Coulomb interactions, showing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the expected trend towards Maxwellian equilibria.</description>

      <title>On flying through the base of a pseudo-streamer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.</description>
