      <title>Towards an Optimal Bound for the Interleaving Distance on Mapper Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapper graphs are a widely used tool in topological data analysis and visualization. They can be viewed as discrete approximations of Reeb graphs, offering insight into the shape and connectivity of complex data. Given a high-dimensional point cloud $\mathbb{X}$ equipped with a function $f: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{R}$, a mapper graph provides a summary of the topological structure of $\mathbb{X}$ induced by $f$, where each node represents a local neighborhood, and edges connect nodes whose corresponding neighborhoods overlap. Our focus is the interleaving distance for mapper graphs, arising from a discretization of the version for Reeb graphs, which is NP-hard to compute. This distance quantifies the similarity between two mapper graphs by measuring the extent to which they must be ``stretched" to become comparable. Recent work introduced a loss function that provides an upper bound on the interleaving distance for mapper graphs, which evaluates how far a given assignment is from being a true interleaving. Finding the loss is computationally tractable, offering a practical way to estimate the distance.
  In this paper, we employ a categorical formulation of mapper graphs and develop the first framework for computing the associated loss function. Since the quality of the bound depends on the chosen assignment, we optimize this loss function by formulating the problem of finding the best assignment as an integer linear programming problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our optimization, we apply it to small mapper graphs where the interleaving distance is known, demonstrating that the optimized upper bound successfully matches the interleaving distance in these cases. Additionally, we conduct an experiment on the MPEG-7 dataset, computing the pairwise optimal loss on a collection of mapper graphs derived from images and leveraging the distance bound for image classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an overview of the 2025 Computational Geometry Challenge targeting the problem Minimum Non-Obtuse Triangulation: Given a planar straight-line graph G in the plane, defined by a set of points in the plane (representing vertices) and a set of non-crossing line segments connecting them (representing edges); the objective is to find a feasible non-obtuse triangulation that uses a minimum number of Steiner points. If no triangulation without obtuse triangles is found, the secondary objective is to minimize the number of obtuse triangles in the triangulation.</description>

      <title>Shelling and Sinking Graphs on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a promising approach to efficiently morph spherical graphs, extending earlier approaches of Awartani and Henderson [Trans. AMS 1987] and Kobourov and Landis [JGAA 2006]. Specifically, we describe two methods to morph shortest-path triangulations of the sphere by moving their vertices along longitudes into the southern hemisphere; we call a triangulation sinkable if such a morph exists. Our first method generalizes a longitudinal shelling construction of Awartani and Henderson; a triangulation is sinkable if a specific orientation of its dual graph is acyclic. We describe a simple polynomial-time algorithm to find a longitudinally shellable rotation of a given spherical triangulation, if one exists; we also construct a spherical triangulation that has no longitudinally shellable rotation. Our second method is based on a linear-programming characterization of sinkability. By identifying its optimal basis, we show that this linear program can be solved in $O(n^{\omega/2})$ time, where $\omega$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent, assuming the underlying linear system is non-singular. Finally, we pose several conjectures and describe experimental results that support them.</description>

      <title>A Practical Algorithm for Knot Factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for computing the prime factorisation of a knot, which is practical in the following sense: using Regina, we give an implementation that works well for inputs of reasonable size, including prime knots from the $19$-crossing census. The main new ingredient in this work is an object that we call an "edge-ideal triangulation", which is what our algorithm uses to represent knots. As other applications, we give an alternative proof that prime knot recognition is in coNP, and present some new complexity results for triangulations. Beyond knots, our work showcases edge-ideal triangulations as a tool for potential applications in $3$-manifold topology.</description>

      <title>On the cosine similarity and orthogonality between persistence diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological data analysis is an approach to study shape of a data set by means of topology. Its main object of study is the persistence diagram, which represents the topological features of the data set at different spatial resolutions. Multiple data sets can be compared by the similarity of their diagrams to understand their behaviors in relative to each other. The bottleneck and Wasserstein distances are often used as a tool to indicate the similarity. In this paper, we introduce cosine similarity as a new indicator for the similarity between persistence diagrams and investigate its properties. Furthermore, it leads to the new notion of orthogonality between persistence diagrams. It turns out that the orthogonality refers to perfect dissimilarity between persistence diagrams under the cosine similarity. Through data demonstration, the cosine similarity is shown to be more accurate than the standard distances to measure the similarity between persistence diagrams.</description>

      <title>Distinct Distances Between a Line and Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of distinct distances result: a lower bound on the number of distances between points on a line and points on a two-dimensional strip. This can be seen as a generalization of the well-studied problems of distances between points on two lines or curves. Unlike these existing problems, this new variant only makes sense if the points satisfy an additional spacing condition.
  Our work can also be seen as an exploration of the proximity technique that was recently introduced by Solymosi and Zahl. This technique lies at the heart of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Ortho-Radial Drawing in Near-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An orthogonal drawing is an embedding of a plane graph into a grid. In a seminal work of Tamassia (SIAM Journal on Computing 1987), a simple combinatorial characterization of angle assignments that can be realized as bend-free orthogonal drawings was established, thereby allowing an orthogonal drawing to be described combinatorially by listing the angles of all corners. The characterization reduces the need to consider certain geometric aspects, such as edge lengths and vertex coordinates, and simplifies the task of graph drawing algorithm design.
  Barth, Niedermann, Rutter, and Wolf (SoCG 2017) established an analogous combinatorial characterization for ortho-radial drawings, which are a generalization of orthogonal drawings to cylindrical grids. The proof of the characterization is existential and does not result in an efficient algorithm. Niedermann, Rutter, and Wolf (SoCG 2019) later addressed this issue by developing quadratic-time algorithms for both testing the realizability of a given angle assignment as an ortho-radial drawing without bends and constructing such a drawing.
  In this paper, we further improve the time complexity of these tasks to near-linear time. We establish a new characterization for ortho-radial drawings based on the concept of a good sequence. Using the new characterization, we design a simple greedy algorithm for constructing ortho-radial drawings.</description>

      <title>On maximum-sum matchings of bichromatic points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Huemer et al. (Discrete Math, 2019) proved that for any two finite point sets $R$ and $B$ in the plane with $|R| = |B|$, the perfect matching that matches points of $R$ with points of $B$, and maximizes the total squared Euclidean distance of the matched pairs, has the property that all the disks induced by the matching have a nonempty common intersection. A pair of matched points induces the disk that has the segment connecting the points as diameter. In this note, we characterize these maximum-sum matchings for some family of continuous (semi-)metrics, focusing on both the Euclidean distance and squared Euclidean distance. Using this characterization, we give a different but simpler proof for the common intersection property proved by Huemer et al..</description>

      <title>Searching in Euclidean Spaces with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of searching for a target at some unknown location in $\mathbb{R}^d$ when additional information regarding the position of the target is available in the form of predictions. In our setting, predictions come as approximate distances to the target: for each point $p\in \mathbb{R}^d$ that the searcher visits, we obtain a value $\lambda(p)$ such that $|p\bm{t}|\le \lambda(p) \le c\cdot |p\bm{t}|$, where $c\ge 1$ is a fixed constant, $\bm{t}$ is the position of the target, and $|p\bm{t}|$ is the Euclidean distance of $p$ to $\bm{t}$. The cost of the search is the length of the path followed by the searcher. Our main positive result is a strategy that achieves $(10c)^{d+1}$-competitive ratio, even when the constant $c$ is unknown. We also give a lower bound of roughly $(c/4)^{d-1}$ on the competitive ratio of any search strategy in $\RR^d$, assuming that $c\ge 4$.</description>

      <title>Polycubes via Dual Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study polycubes: orthogonal polyhedra with axis-aligned quadrilateral faces. We present a complete characterization of polycubes of any genus based on their dual structure: a collection of oriented loops which run in each of the axis directions and capture polycubes via their intersection patterns. A polycube loop structure uniquely corresponds to a polycube. We also describe all combinatorially different ways to add a loop to a loop structure while maintaining its validity. Similarly, we show how to identify loops that can be removed from a polycube loop structure without invalidating it. Our characterization gives rise to an iterative algorithm to construct provably valid polycube maps for a given input surface.</description>

      <title>The Power of Recursive Embeddings for $\ell_p$ Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric embedding is a powerful tool used extensively in mathematics and computer science. We devise a new method of using metric embeddings recursively, which turns out to be particularly effective in $\ell_p$ spaces, $p&gt;2$, yielding state-of-the-art results for Lipschitz decomposition, for Nearest Neighbor Search, and for embedding into $\ell_2$. In a nutshell, our method composes metric embeddings by viewing them as reductions between problems, and thereby obtains a new reduction that is substantially more effective than the known reduction that employs a single embedding. We in fact apply this method recursively, oftentimes using double recursion, which further amplifies the gap from a single embedding.</description>
