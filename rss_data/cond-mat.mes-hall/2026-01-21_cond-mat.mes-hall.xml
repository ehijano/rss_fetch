      <title>Exciton-polaron Umklapp scattering in Wigner crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong Coulomb interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors give rise to tightly bound excitons, exciton polarons, and correlated electronic phases such as Wigner crystals (WCs), yet their mutual interplay remains poorly understood. Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Laughlin pumping assisted by surface acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect is a fascinating electrical transport phenomenon signified by precise quantization of Hall conductivity $\sigma_\mathrm{xy}$ and vanishing longitudinal conductivity $\sigma_\mathrm{xx}$. Laughlin proposed an elegant explanation in which adiabatic insertion of a flux tube pumps charge through the system. This analysis unveils the fundamental role of gauge invariance and provides a compelling argument about the fractional charge of fractional quantum Hall states. While it has been used extensively as a theoretical tool, a quantitative experimental investigation is lacking despite multiple attempts. Here we report successful realizations of Laughlin pumping in several integer and fractional quantum Hall states. One essential technical innovation is using surface acoustic waves to periodically clear the charges accumulated during the pumping process. Magnetic fluxes are inserted at a constant rate so there is no need to perform complicated data fitting. Furthermore, our setting can reliably extract $\sigma_\mathrm{xx}$ that is several orders of magnitude lower than the limit of conventional techniques. Effective energy gaps can be deduced from the temperature dependence of $\sigma_\mathrm{xx}$, which are drastically different from those provided by conventional transport data. This work not only brings a famous gedanken experiment to reality but also serves as a portal for many future investigations.</description>

      <title>Magnetoexcitons and Massive Dirac Fermions in Monolayers of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides in a High Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of the emission spectrum of magnetoexcitons interacting with a $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall state of massive Dirac fermions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in high magnetic fields. Using an ab initio-parametrized massive Dirac fermion model including valley and spin degrees of freedom, combined with exact diagonalization techniques, we show that interband emission from the massive Dirac Fermion magnetoexciton interacting with $\nu = 1$ state directly probes intra-conduction-band excitations of the $\nu = 1$. Many-body interactions with the filled massive Dirac fermion $\nu = 1$ level yield a strong renormalization of the emission spectrum, including fully polarized emission, a pronounced redshift, and broadening relative to neutral and charged excitons. The calculated spectra are consistent with recent experiments [1-3], establishing magneto-spectroscopy as a probe of finite carrier densities in massive Dirac systems.</description>

      <title>Ratchet effect in lateral plasmonic crystal: Giant enhancement due to interference of "bright" and "dark" modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of the ratchet effect in a lateral plasmonic crystal (LPC) formed by a two dimensional electron gas under a periodic dual-grating gate. The system is driven by terahertz radiation, and the spatial asymmetry required for the generation of dc photocurrent is introduced by a phase shift between the radiation's near-field modulation and the static electron density profile. In contrast to the commonly used perturbative "minimal model" of the ratchet effect, which assumes weak density modulation, we solve the problem exactly with respect to the static gate-induced potential while treating the radiation field perturbatively. This approach reveals a dramatic enhancement of the plasmonic contribution to the ratchet current due to the interference of "bright" and "dark" plasmon modes, which are excited on an equal footing in the asymmetric LPC. Specifically, we predict a parametric growth of the plasmonic peak as compared with the Drude peak with increasing coupling, and the appearance of a dense super-resonant structure when the spacing between plasmonic sub-bands becomes larger than the damping rate. Hence, the dc response exhibits both resonant and super-resonant regimes observed in recent experiments on the radiation transmission through the LPC. The interplay of bright and dark modes, together with their interference, provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the magnitude and sign of the photocurrent by gate voltages and the radiation frequency.</description>

      <title>Influence of leads on signatures of strongly-correlated zero-bias anomaly in double quantum dot measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of disorder and interactions is known in many systems to produce a feature in the single-particle density of states, the shape and parameter dependence of which act as signatures of the underlying electronic state. Strong Coulomb repulsion gives rise to a host of novel phenomena, among these is a unique zero-bias anomaly. While understanding of the anomaly in bulk materials remains incomplete, a version of this anomaly can be found in an ensemble of two-site systems and hence has been predicted to be observable in parallel-coupled double quantum dots. However, prior work did not include the influence of the leads. Here we show that the presence of the leads results in changes to the projected stability diagrams but that the signature of the strongly-correlated zero-bias anomaly nonetheless remains clearly visible.</description>

      <title>Guided spin wave in monolayer CrSBr: Localization and spin-orbit coupling from dipolar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-wave spectrum of monolayer CrSBr waveguides was studied by numerically diagonalizing the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian derived from linearising the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In contrast to its short-range counterparts, the long-range dipolar field acts statically as a confining potential for spin wave, while the dynamic part couples the spin and orbit degrees of freedom, thus giving rise to spin-orbit coupling for spin wave. Due to the inversion symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the spinor structure of the wave function, spin-wave eigenstates form doublets with definite parity. Micromagnetic simulation tallies well with numerical calculation. Our study on spin-wave eigenstates in CrSBr waveguides sheds light on the nature of exchange-dipole spin wave in ferromagnetic slabs. We confirm particularly that the robustness of the Damon-Eshbach mode is not derived from topology, but rather from the static dipolar field. Moreover, a thorough knowledge on spin wave in monolayer CrSBr itself represents a step forward to understanding the more complicated antiferromagnetic resonance in bulk CrSBr.</description>

      <title>Zero-phonon line emission of single photon emitters in helium-ion treated MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the zero-phonon line of single photon emitters in helium-ion treated monolayer MoS$_2$, which are currently understood in terms of single sulfur-site vacancies. By comparing the linewidths of the zero-phonon line as extracted directly from optical spectra with values inferred from the first-order autocorrelation function of the photoluminescence, we quantify bounds of the homogeneous broadening and of phonon-assisted contributions. The results are discussed in terms of both the independent boson model and ab-initio results as computed from GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation approximations.</description>

      <title>Study of Twistronics Induced Superconductivity in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) through computational calculations, with the aim of understanding the emergence of flat bands and conditions favorable for superconductivity close to the magic angle. This study utilizes a k\cdot p continuum model, and the low-energy Hamiltonians are derived from angle-dependent datasets provided by Carr et al. Using this model, the band structure, density of states (DoS), and Fermi velocity are systematically calculated across a range of twist angles. The calculations are performed by discretizing high-symmetry paths in the moire Brillouin zone for band structure calculations, uniformly sampling a square grid for DoS analysis, and employing finite-difference methods to evaluate the Fermi velocity near the Dirac points. The results identify a narrow magic-angle window around $\theta \approx 0.98^\circ-1.00^\circ$, where the bands become nearly dispersionless, the DoS exhibits a sharp peak, and the Fermi velocity is strongly suppressed. This computational framework does not directly predict superconductivity, but rather establishes the electronic foundation for exploring flat-band physics and correlation-driven phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Giant Damping-like Spin-Torque Conductivity in a GeTe/Py van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of large unconventional spin-orbit torques in van der Waals (vdW) materials are driving intense interest for energy-efficient spintronic applications. A key limitation of ferromagnet (FM)/vdW heterostructures is their lower value of damping-like torque conductivity ($\sigma{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$) compared to the conventional heavy metal-based systems, limiting their prospects for commercial spintronic devices. Here, we report both a giant $\sigma{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$ of $-(1.25 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{5}~\hbar/ 2e~\Omega^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ and an unconventional spin-orbit torque in a heterostructure comprising an FM (Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) and the vdW material GeTe. The value of $\sigma{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$ represents the highest reported torque conductivity for any FM/vdW interface and is comparable to benchmark heavy metal heterostructures. First-principles calculations reveal that this substantial torque originates from the cooperative interplay of the spin Hall effect, orbital Hall effect, and orbital Rashba effect, assisted by interfacial charge transfer. These findings demonstrate the potential of carefully engineered vdW heterostructures to achieve highly efficient electrical manipulation of magnetization at room temperature, paving the way for next-generation low-power spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Kineo-Elasticity and Nonreciprocal Phonons by Rashba-induced Interfacial Spin-Lattice Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a previously unrecognized spin-lattice coupling that is allowed in the presence of broken inversion symmetry that can be considered as a lattice analogue to the electronic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In the low-frequency regime with magnons integrated out, the interfacial spin-lattice coupling is shown to engender a kineo-elastic term in the phonon Lagrangian that couples the strain on the lattice to its velocity and thereby gives rise to a nonreciprocity in transverse phonon velocity. We further analyze the full magnon-phonon spectrum and uncover directional hybridization and absorption, leading to asymmetric phonon propagation lengths for opposite directions. Our results indicate that such interfacial spin-lattice coupling can serve as an efficient route to achieve nonreciprocal phonon propagation properties in magnetic heterostructures with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Klein tunneling in quantum geometric semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Klein tunneling stands as a fundamental probe of relativistic quantum transport in two-dimensional materials. We investigate this phenomenon in quadratic band-touching systems, where the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance plays a central role in the underlying mechanism. By employing a generic parabolic model, we systematically disentangle the cooperative effects of intrinsic mass asymmetry and tunable quantum geometry. We demonstrate that mass asymmetry sets the overall transmission profile, including the angular distribution and the resonance channels. In contrast, we show that quantum geometry provides a universal parameter that modulates tunneling efficiency by tuning the quantum distance, while leaving the energy dispersion unchanged. Specifically, quantum geometry plays a dual role: it governs the overall transmission amplitude through pseudospin mismatch, while its interplay with Fabry-Perot interference induces observable shifts in resonance angles. Our findings reveal that incorporating quantum geometry alongside band structure is essential for a complete description of quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation of Ferromagnetic Magnons by Parametric Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to prepare and certify Gaussian quantum states of the ferromagnetic resonance spin-wave modes in ferromagnets using a longitudinal drive. Contrary to quantum optics-based strategies, our approach harnesses a purely magnonic feature - the spin-wave nonlinearity - to generate magnon squeezing. This resource is used to prepare vacuum-squeezed states, as well as entangled states between modes of different magnets coupled via a microwave cavity. We propose methods to detect such states with classical methods, such as ferromagnetic resonance or local pickup coils, and quantify the required detection efficiency. We analytically solve the case of ellipsoidal yttrium iron garnet ferrimagnets, but our method applies to a vast range of shapes and sizes. Our work enables quantum magnonics experiments without single-magnon sources or detectors (qubits), thus bringing the quantum regime within reach of the wider magnonics community.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic nanocavity-enabled universal detection of layer-breathing vibrations in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Raman spectroscopy faces inherent limitations in detecting interlayer layer breathing (LB) vibrations with inherently weak electron-phonon coupling or Raman inactivity in two-dimensional materials, hindering insights into interfacial coupling and stacking dynamics. Here we demonstrate a universal plasmon-enhanced Raman spectroscopy strategy using gold or silver nanocavities to strongly enhance and detect LB modes in multilayer graphene, hBN, and their van der Waals heterostructures. Plasmonic nanocavities even modify the linear and circular polarization selection rules of the LB vibrations. By developing an electric-field-modulated interlayer bond polarizability model, we quantitatively explain the observed intensity profiles and reveal the synergistic roles of localized plasmonic field enhancement and interfacial polarizability modulation. This model successfully describes the behavior across different material systems and nanocavity geometries. This work not only overcomes traditional detection barriers but also provides a quantitative framework for probing interlayer interactions, offering a versatile platform for investigating hidden interfacial phonons and advancing the characterization of layered quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Using Andreev bound states and spin to remove domain walls in a Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dot-superconductor hybrids have been established as a suitable platform for realizing Kitaev chains hosting Majorana bound states. Implementing these structures in a qubit architecture is expected to result in coherence times that scale exponentially with the lengths of the chains. To scale to longer systems, the phase differences between all superconducting segments in the chain need to be controlled. While this control has been demonstrated by using an external magnetic flux, ideally it can be achieved with control over intrinsic system parameters. In this work, we investigate whether the relevant phase differences can be tuned through the spin degree of freedom in each QD, or the chemical potential of the discrete bound states in the hybrid sections. We confirm that both these tuning knobs allow for controlling the phase difference in the couplings between neighbouring QDs, bypassing the requirement to tune an external flux. However, we find that the amplitude of the phase shifts can deviate from a discrete $\pi$-shift. We introduce a spatial variation in the spin-orbit field as a possible mechanism to explain the observed behaviour and comment on the consequences for experimentally creating long Kitaev chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations (SdHO) with V-shaped minima are experimentally studied in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas based on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. A phenomenological model with two parameters (transport momentum relaxation time $\tau_{\text{tr}}$ and quantum scattering time $\tau_q$) is developed, accurately describing experimentally measured magnetoresistance over an unexpectedly wide range of magnetic fields (up to 3.5 T) and temperatures (from 2 K to 15 K). The model combines: (i) a quasiclassical density of states with a magnetic-field-dependent Gaussian broadening of Landau levels, (ii) a momentum relaxation time scaling with the density of states, and (iii) oscillations of the Fermi level at a fixed electron density. This model reproduces V-shaped oscillation minima with zero-resistance points, a smooth background of positive magnetoresistance, and enables the extraction of $\tau_q$ and $\tau_{\text{tr}}$ even in microstructures where ballistic and viscous effects dominate at low fields. As expected, the temperature dependence reveals that $\tau_{\text{tr}}$ scales inversely with temperature due to acoustic phonon scattering, while $\tau_q$ remains temperature-independent.</description>

      <title>Theory of Correlated Hofstadter Spectrum in Magic-Angle Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic-field-induced correlated Chern insulator (CCI) states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have been intensively studied in experiments, but a simple and clear understanding of their origin is still lacking. Here, we propose a unified theoretical framework for the CCI states in MATBG that successfully explains most experimental observations. The key insight of our theory is that, due to the very narrow bandwidth of MATBG, correlation-enhanced valley and spin Zeeman terms are critical for shaping the intricate Hofstadter spectrum, resulting in an interwoven, flavor-resolved (spin and valley) Hofstadter spectrum that can well describe the observed CCI states. Crucially, due to the Zeeman effect, the crossings between these flavor-polarized Hofstadter spectra are magnetic-field-dependent, causing certain CCI states to emerge only above a critical field. This is the main mechanism underlying the critical field phenomenon of the CCI states observed in experiments. Our theory provides a clear and unified physical picture for the correlated Hofstadter spectrum in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Topological Charges, Fermi Arcs, and Surface States of $K_4$ Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological electronic properties of the $K_4$ crystal by constructing a tight-binding model. The bulk band structure hosts Weyl nodes with higher and conventional chiralities ($\chi = \pm 2$ and $\chi = \pm 1$) located at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. Through analytical evaluation of the Berry curvature, we identify the positions and chiralities of these Weyl nodes. Furthermore, slab calculations for the (001) surface reveal Fermi arcs that connect Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, including those linking $\chi = \pm 2$ nodes with pairs of $\chi = \mp 1$ nodes. These results demonstrate that the $K_4$ crystal is a spinless Weyl semimetal featuring topologically protected surface states originating from multiple types of Weyl nodes.</description>

      <title>Abelian and non-Abelian fractionalized states in twisted MoTe$_2$: A generalized Landau-level theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators are lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states that realize fractionalized quasiparticles without an external magnetic field. A key strategy to understand and design these phases is to map Chern bands onto Landau levels (LLs). Here, we introduce a universal framework that variationally decomposes Bloch bands into generalized LLs, providing a controlled and quantitative characterization of their effective LL nature. Applying this approach to twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ modeled by first-principles-derived moir\'e Hamiltonians, we find that the first moir\'e valence band is dominated by the generalized zeroth LL across a broad range of twist angles, facilitating the formation of Abelian fractional Chern insulators in the Jain sequences. The second moir\'e band, renormalized via Hartree-Fock calculations at hole filling $\nu_h = 2$, is dominated by the generalized first LL at twist angles $\theta = 2.45^\circ$ and $2.13^\circ$. At $\theta = 2.45^\circ$, we find numerical evidence for a non-Abelian Moore--Read (MR) state at $\nu_h = 5/2$, with consistent signatures in both the energy spectrum and the particle entanglement spectrum. Interpolation studies further demonstrate an adiabatic connection between this state and the MR state in the conventional first LL. In contrast, at $\theta = 2.13^\circ$, a charge-density-wave state prevails in the competition with the MR state due to the larger bandwidth. Our variational mapping provides a theoretical framework for exploring exotic fractionalized phases, including non-Abelian states, in realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic phonon induced magnetism in moir\'e Mott-Wigner crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that magnetism in moir\'e Mott-Wigner crystals can be induced by the collective vibration of electrons around their equilibrium positions (i.e., electronic phonons), even without spin interactions between electrons. Due to a geometric valley-orbit coupling from the Berry phase effect, the zero-point energy of electronic phonons reaches minimum when electrons are fully valley polarized. This leads to a spontaneous magnetization when below a critical temperature. We also propose to engineer the magnetism through the photoexcitation of chiral electronic phonons.</description>

      <title>Properties of topological insulators and superconductors under relativistic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between the curved spacetimes of general relativity and quantum mechanical systems is an active field of research. However, analysis of relativistic gravitation on extended quantum systems remains understudied. To this end, we study here the effects of a general relativistic curved spacetime on the topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and Kitaev superconducting wire. We find that the topological states remain robust and well localized. In the topological insulator we find that the energy level of the topological state becomes shifted away from zero according to the gravitational redshift, breaking the system's chiral symmetry. In contrast, the Majorana zero mode of the topological superconductor remains at zero energy. Furthermore, within the topological superconductor, we identify the possibility of a gravitationally induced topological phase transition leading to the formation of a domain wall, shifting one of the boundary Majorana zero modes into the bulk.</description>

      <title>A functionally reversible probabilistic computing architecture enabled by interactions of current-controlled magnetic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic computers replace logic gates with networks of interacting random variables, creating bidirectional systems that can back-derive inputs from outputs. Such architectures enable efficient generation of random samples, implementations of novel algorithms, and natural solutions to classically hard problems such as prime factorization. We present a new physical implementation for these networks: ferromagnetic disks whose magnetization switching process is triggered by current pulses, skewed by external magnetic fields, and randomized by ambient thermal noise. We show that geometry-dependent magnetostatic interactions between these magnetic cells lead to system behavior that emulates deterministic logic gates. Furthermore, by chaining multiple "gates," we achieve a highly accurate bidirectional one-bit full-adder, a proof of concept for complex multi-gate logic functions with reversible information flow. This analog magnetic probabilistic computer methodology improves on other implementations in speed, tunability, and energy efficiency, thereby enabling a powerful new pathway towards practical solution of classically hard problems.</description>

Abstract: This study explores how entanglement and quantum teleportation of magnons can be achieved in coupled spin chain systems. By utilizing different magnetic configurations, we show that parallel spin chains function like magnonic beam splitters, whereas anti-parallel chains produce two-magnon squeezing and strong entanglement. Combining these components, we design magnonic circuits capable of continuous-variable quantum entanglement and teleportation, supported by quantum Langevin simulations.</description>

      <title>Surface Phonon Hall Viscosity Induced Phonon Chirality and Nonreciprocity in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons. Surface phonon Hall viscosity provides a mechanism to control phonon chirality and nonreciprocity via surface magnetization configurations in magnetic topological insulator films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate loopless multiterminal hybrid superconducting devices at odd fermion parity with time-reversal symmetry. We find that the energy-phase relationship has a double minimum corresponding to opposite windings of the superconducting phases. Spin-orbit coupling adds multi-axial spin splittings, which contrasts with two-terminal devices where spin dependence is uniaxial. Capacitive shunting localizes quantum circuit states in the wells and exponentially suppresses their splitting. For weak spin-orbit strength, the system has a four-dimensional spin-chirality low-energy subspace which can be universally controlled with electric fields only.</description>

      <title>Improving the electrical conductivity of Pt nanowires deposited by focused electron beam induced deposition using thermal annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the electrical conductivity of platinum nanowires with heights ranging from 2 nm to 200 nm, deposited by focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID). Post-deposition processing was employed to enhance the electrical conductivity of the platinum nanowires. Thermal annealing of as-deposited nanowires in air at 225$^{\circ}$C for 4 hours increased electrical conductance by up to five orders of magnitude. After annealing, 22.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$-long nanowires with a height of 36 nm exhibited resistances of approximately 10 k$\Omega$. This nanowire underwent a reduction in height to one-quarter of its original value, a reduction in width to one half, and a reduction in cross-sectional area by approximately one order of magnitude. The platinum-to-carbon weight ratio increased from 35:65 to 85:15. The electrical resistance decreased monotonically as temperature was lowered from room temperature to 100 mK, confirming that annealed FEBID platinum nanowires are promising building blocks for nanoelectronic devices operating at millikelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Gigahertz-frequency Lamb wave resonator cavities on suspended lithium niobate for quantum acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phononic nanodevices offer a promising route toward quantum technologies, as phonons combine strong confinement within matter with broad coupling capabilities to various quantum systems. In particular, the piezoelectric response of materials such as lithium niobate enables coupling between superconducting qubits and gigahertz-frequency phonons. However, bulk lithium niobate phononic devices typically rely on surface acoustic waves and are therefore inherently subject to leakage from the surface into the bulk substrate. Here, we explore the acoustic behavior of resonator cavities supporting GHz-frequency Lamb waves in a 200 nm-thick suspended lithium niobate layer. We characterize the acoustic response at both room and millikelvin temperatures. We find that our resonator cavities with strong confinement reach intrinsic quality factors of approximately 6000 at the single phonon level. We use the measured parameters of the resonators to model their coupling to a superconducting transmon qubit, allowing us to evaluate their potential as quantum acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Probing Fermi-surface spin-textures via the nonlinear Shubnikov-de Haas effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of spin and electronic degrees of freedom via the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is an essential ingredient for many proposed future technologies. However, probing the strength and nature of SOI is a significant challenge, especially in heterostructures. Here, we consider the nonlinear Shubnikov-de Haas (NSdH) effect, a quantum oscillatory effect that occurs under conditions similar to those of the well-known SdH effect, but is second order in the applied electric field. We demonstrate that, unlike its linear counterpart, the NSdH effect is highly sensitive to the spin textures that arise from SOI. In particular, we show that the phase and beating of NSdH oscillations in nonlinear conductivities can clearly distinguish between different types of SOI. As a demonstration, we show how NSdH can distinguish between the linear and cubic Rashba couplings that are expected in germanium heterostructures. Our results establish the NSdH effect as a powerful and sensitive probe of SOI, offering a new framework for characterizing materials relevant to topology, spintronics, and solid-state quantum information technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied transport of indirect excitons (IXs) and IX mediated spin transport in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure in magnetic fields up to 8 T. We observed the long-range IX transport and the long-range IX mediated spin transport in the magnetic fields. The IX transport and spin transport are characterized by the 1/e decay distances reaching $\sim$ 100 micrometers. The decay distance of the spin transport correlates with the decay distance of IX transport. These decay distances first increase and then decrease with increasing IX density for all studied magnetic fields. The long-range IX transport and the long-range spin transport in the magnetic fields are consistent with the similar long-range transport in zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Classical transport theory for the planar Hall effect with threefold symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the planar Hall effect (PHE) has become a key probe of Berry curvature and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Threefold-symmetric signals under in-plane fields are often attributed to such quantum mechanisms. Here, we establish a purely classical origin for a three-fold-symmetric PHE. The idea is simple yet decisive: a third-order expansion of the Boltzmann equation in the magnetic field reveals that the threefold component originates from the relative positions of the mirror planes in the crystals with respect to the measurement setups. Remarkably, the threefold contribution should be ubiquitous because this symmetry condition can be realized across a broad range of crystals. Numerical estimates based on concrete models further show that its amplitude is comparable to that expected from the AHE.</description>

      <title>Layer Decoupling in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$ Uncovered by Automated Dark-Field Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer systems host a wealth of emergent phenomena, such as flat-band superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and ferroelectricity, arising from moir\'e superlattices and unconventional interlayer coupling. Despite their central role, direct and quantitative access to the out-of-plane atomic structure in these systems has remained elusive due to their nanoscale dimensions. Here, we introduce an automated dark-field electron tomography technique that enables three-dimensional structural analysis of atomically thin materials with sub-angstrom precision. Applying this method to twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we uncover a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing compared to the bulk configuration, exceeding 0.1 angstrom, along with a remarkable temperature-driven interlayer decoupling unique to the twisted bilayer. Ultrafast measurement further reveals optically induced interlayer separation of ~0.2 angstrom on the picosecond timescale, attributed to transient exciton formation. These findings not only establish a powerful approach for visualizing hidden out-of-plane structures in atomically thin micro-flake materials, but also uncover the intrinsic fragility and dynamical tunability of interlayer coupling in moir\'e-engineered 2-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Induced Floquet Engineering and Non-Abelian Geometric Phases in Driven Quantum Wire Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work theoretically demonstrates that a spin qubit in a parabolic quantum wire driven by a bichromatic field exhibits a confinement-tunable synthetic gauge field, leading to novel Floquet topological phenomena. The study presents the underlying mechanism for topological protection of qubit states against time-periodic perturbations. The analysis reveals a confinement-induced topological Landau-Zener transition, marked by a shift from preserved symmetries to chiral interference patterns in Landau-Zener-St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg-Majorana interferometry. Notably, the emergence of non-Abelian geometric phases under cyclic evolution in curved confinement and phase-parameter space is identified, enabling holonomic quantum computation. Additionally, the prediction of unconventional Floquet-Bloch oscillations in the quasi-energy and resonance transition probability spectra as a function of the biharmonic phase indicates exotic properties, including fractal spectra and fractional Floquet tunneling. These phenomena provide direct evidence of coherent transport in the synthetic dimension. Collectively, these findings position quantum wire materials has a versatile platform for Floquet engineering, topological quantum control, and fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Interlayer charge transfer from contact electrification in conducting micro and nanoscale thin film heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact electrification give rise to charge accumulation at the interface when two materials are brought into contact with each other. The charge accumulation at the interface will diffuse to the interior of the conducting material if the dimensions of the contacting conducting material is of the order of an unknown critical length scale. This contact electrification induced interlayer charge transfer will modify the fundamental physical properties of both the contacting materials. This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials.</description>

      <title>Layer-engineered quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted rhombohedral graphene family</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is uniquely characterized by the topological Chern number C. Controlling the Chern number is a key step toward functional topological electronics and enables access to exotic quantum phases beyond the traditional quantum Hall physics. Here, we report a series of QAH insulators in twisted rhombohedral graphene family, in which the Chern number can be tuned through layer configuration, in-situ electrostatic doping, and displacement field. Specifically, in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral N-layer graphene, denoted as (1+N) L, we observe QAH states with C=N at moire filling v=1, where N=3,4,5 represents the layer number of rhombohedral graphene. These results are experimentally confirmed by quantized Hall resistance and the Streda formula. In twisted monolayer-trilayer graphene, we also observe states with |C|=3 at v=3, whose sign can be switched by either electrostatic doping or displacement field. Furthermore, in twisted Bernal bilayer-rhombohedral tetralayer graphene denoted as (2+4) L, we demonstrate a displacement-field-driven topological phase transition between two distinct QAH states with C=3 and C=4 at v=1. Our work establishes twisted rhombohedral graphene as a highly versatile, layer-engineered platform for designing and dynamically controlling high-Chern-number topological matters.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical response as a probe of emergent Lorentz symmetry violation in noncentrosymmetric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an electrically controlled protocol to detect weak Lorentz-violating (LV) backgrounds through the second-order shift photocurrent in noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a spinful Rice--Mele model, we show that a stationary LV background induces a momentum-odd correction to the Bloch Hamiltonian, which generates an odd-in-field contribution to the shift current. This leads to a directional asymmetry, whereby the photocurrent distinguishes opposite orientations of an applied static field. The effect originates from an LV-induced deformation of the interband phase and can be isolated experimentally by comparing field-reversed configurations, with vanishing response at transverse orientations, providing an internal consistency check. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear optical responses offer a practical and symmetry-selective route for probing LV effects in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Adsorption-Driven Symmetry Lowering in Single Molecules Revealed by {\AA}ngstrom-scale Tip-Enhanced Raman Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational landscape of adsorbed molecules is central to understanding surface interactions at the atomic scale, influencing phenomena from catalysis to molecular electronics. Recent advances in atomic-scale tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) have enabled vibrational mapping of single molecules with sub-nanometer spatial resolution, providing unprecedented insights into molecule-surface interactions by confining light in plasmonic picocavities. Here, we exploit TERS in a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope junction to perform Raman hyperspectral mapping of single iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules in three non-equivalent adsorption configurations on Ag surfaces. We explore the changes in the vibrational modes of FePc molecules adsorbed on two distinct silver crystal terminations with differing symmetry, Ag(111) and Ag(110), revealing how subtle variations in the adsorption geometry due to substrate anisotropy can strongly influence molecular vibrations, lifting the degeneracy of individual normal modes. Our findings not only demonstrate the first use of sub-nanometer TERS mapping across different symmetry configurations but also provide a deeper understanding of how site-specific vibrational properties are intimately linked to local atomic environments. This capability paves the way for precisely tailoring surface interactions and controlling chemical reactions at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Efficient charge transfer in solution-processed PbS Quantum Dot-reduced graphene oxide hybrid materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dot - graphene hybrid materials have raised significant interest due to the unique synergy of the optical properties of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) and the transport properties of graphene. This stimulated the development of low-cost and up-scalable solution-processed strategies for hybrid materials with potential application in light harvesting and opto-electronic devices. Here we report a versatile covalent-linking based approach for the functionalization of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), to prepare a variety of QD-rGO hybrid dispersions with QDs of different size and composition (PbS, PbS/CdS and CdSe QDs), and shape (CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods). We achieved a well-controlled QD coverage of the rGO sheets by functionalizing the rGO surface with mercapto-silane linkers. A further spectroscopic investigation of near-infrared PbS QD-rGO materials demonstrates efficient electronic coupling between both materials. The QD photoluminescence emission quenching and exciton lifetime shortening up to 95%, together with subtle graphene Raman G-band shifts upon QD linking, supports electron transfer as the dominant relaxation pathway from the QD to the rGO. The use of core/shell PbS/CdS QDs allows tuning of the transfer efficiency from 94% for a 0.2 nm thin CdS shell, down to 30% for a 1.1 nm thick shell.</description>

      <title>Coupling Quantum Dots to Elastic Waves in a Phononic Crystal Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of quantum dot (QD) coupling to various phononic modes in a phononic waveguide, combining multiband kp and configuration-interaction (CI) QD state simulations with finite-element waveguide mode modeling. We consider self-assembled Stranski-Krastanov InGaAs/GaAs as well as local droplet-etched GaAs/AlGaAs structures. Using kp-CI calculations, we quantify the strain and piezoelectric responses of InAs and GaAs QDs. By systematically isolating volumetric/shear deformation-potential and piezoelectric channels, we demonstrate how mode symmetries dictate distinct coupling mechanisms. We identify the dominant coupling channels and characterize their observable signatures in the QD response. We predict strong linear energy shifts under volumetric strain and quadratic behavior under shear strain, especially in GaAs QDs. The piezoelectric effect is dominated by polarizability, which also leads to a quadratic response. The simulations show energy modulations up to 0.7 meV for an acoustic wave with 0.1 nm amplitude. The quadratic response to shear strain and piezoelectric field leads to frequency doubling in the QD response to a mechanical wave and to non-harmonic time traces when linear and quadratic effects contribute to a similar degree. The deep understanding of QD-acoustic couplings opens pathways to the optimal design of QD and waveguide structures, as well as to improved engineering of acousto-optic quantum interfaces.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of dynamical blockade between transmon qubits via ZZ interaction engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of strong longitudinal (ZZ) coupling between two superconducting transmon qubits achieved solely through capacitive engineering. By systematically varying the qubit frequency detuning, we measure cross-Kerr inter-qubit interaction strengths ranging from 10 MHz up to 350 MHz, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously observed in similar capacitively coupled systems. In this configuration, the qubits enter a strong-interaction regime in which the excitation of one qubit inhibits that of its neighbor, demonstrating a dynamical blockade mediated entirely by the engineered ZZ coupling. Circuit quantization simulations accurately reproduce the experimental results, while perturbative models confirm the theoretical origin of the energy shift as a hybridization between the computational states and higher-excitation manifolds. We establish a robust and scalable method to access interaction-dominated physics in superconducting circuits, providing a pathway towards solid-state implementations of globally controlled quantum architectures and cooperative many-body dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers have been demonstrated as a useful tool in high pressure environments. However, the geometry and small working area of the diamond anvil cells (DACs) used to apply pressure present a challenge to effective delivery of microwave (mw) fields. We designed and characterized a novel slotted design for mw transmission to nitrogen-vacancy centers (NVs) in a diamond anvil cell via zero-field and in-field optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements across pressures between 1 and 48 GPa. The mw fields experienced by NVs across the diamond culet was calculated from Rabi frequency and found to be higher and more uniform than those generated by an equivalent simple mw line, which will improve performance for wide-field, high-pressure measurements to probe spatial variations across samples under pressure.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring the properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) because it allows for precise control of radical and ion energies and fluxes. For chalcogen substitution, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization through thermal chemisorption significantly lowers the sputtering energy threshold ($E_{sputt}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 35$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV. In addition, we find that a non-orthogonal impact angle $\sim 30{}^{\circ}$ reduces the sputtering energy threshold, while cryogenic-range TMD temperatures may increase. To explain the observed trends, a multi-step sputtering mechanism is proposed. Our results show that oxygen/fluorine functionalization, impact angle, and material temperature are key control parameters for selective, damage-free chalcogen removal in TMD processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of quantum phenomena in complex materials such as moir\'e superlattices is limited by the O(N^3) scaling of conventional electronic structure methods. Here we introduce a high-performance tight-binding framework that reduces the complexity to O(N^1.5) by transforming the Hamiltonian into a real symmetric form and combining Sylvester's inertia law with LDL decomposition. This approach enables efficient band structure calculations for large systems: solving magic angle twisted bilayer graphene in minutes on a laptop and scaling to 1.5 million atoms within days on a workstation. We apply it to the previously inaccessible ultra-low twist-angle regime (less than 0.16 degree) with mechanical strain relaxation and find robust flat bands persisting down to 0.09 degree. Our framework bridges density functional theory accuracy with large-scale quantum simulation, opening a route to systematic data-driven exploration of mesoscale quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Reentrant superconductivity and Stoner boundaries in twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin-valley instabilities and their connection to the reentrant superconducting states recently observed in the twisted bilayer dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ at a $5^o$ twist angle. Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moir\'e bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moir\'e valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moir\'e orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral superconductivity is a time reversal symmetry breaking superconducting phase that has attracted broad interest as a potential platform for topological quantum computation. A fundamental consequence of this symmetry breaking is orbital magnetization, yet a clear microscopic formulation of this quantity has remained elusive. This difficulty arises because Bogoliubov quasiparticles do not carry a definite electric charge, precluding a simple interpretation of orbital magnetization in terms of circulating quasiparticle currents. Moreover, superconductivity and ferromagnetism rarely coexist, and in the few materials where they do (e.g. uranium-based compounds), strong spin-orbit coupling obscures the orbital contribution to the magnetization. The recent report of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which has negligible spin-orbit coupling, therefore provides a unique opportunity to develop and test a microscopic theory of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors. Here we develop such a theory, unifying the interband coherence effects underlying normal-state orbital magnetization with the intrinsic orbital moments of the Cooper-pair condensate. Applying our theory to rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, we find that the onset of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the normal-state orbital magnetization, depending sensitively on the bandstructure. We further identify a generalized clapping mode corresponding to coherent fluctuations between the two opposite chiral windings of the p-wave order parameter, with a gap set by the sublattice winding form factor. This collective mode is unique to chiral superconductors and contributes to the orbital magnetization through its role in dressing the photon vertex. Experimental measurements of the orbital magnetization relative to the quarter-metal phase would provide a direct test of our theory.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an efficient first-principles framework for simulating angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) by computing photoelectron states as solutions of the Kohn-Sham equation with scattering boundary conditions. This approach is formally equivalent to the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism but offers superior computational efficiency and direct integration with plane-wave or real-space density functional theory. By enabling direct calculation of photoemission matrix elements, our method bridges the gap between intrinsic electronic properties and experimental ARPES spectra. We demonstrate its accuracy through circular dichroism ARPES simulations for monolayer graphene and bulk $2H$-WSe$_2$, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data and highlighting the critical role of pseudopotentials in describing high-energy photoelectron scattering. Our results establish a robust and accessible route for quantitative ARPES modeling, paving the way for advanced studies of orbital textures, many-body effects, and time-resolved photoemission.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of elastic strings and the thermal conductivity of glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermal conductivity of amorphous solids by constructing a continuum model whose degrees of freedom are propagating vibrational modes (phonons) and extended Volterra dislocation line defects with their own vibrational degrees of freedom which do not propagate in space. Our working assumption is that these additional degrees of freedom account for the "boson peak" that is observed in glassy materials. This identification allows us to obtain the length distribution of dislocations from experimental data of the boson peak for each material, which we use as input to calculate the phonon self-energy in a quantum field theory framework using that the phonon-dislocation interaction is given by the Peach-Koehler force. The tail of the distribution for long dislocations is consistent with an $L^{-5}$ power law. Our results show that this power law yields a linear rise in the thermal conductivity, as observed in glasses at low temperatures. We then consider two approaches to describe thermal conductivity data quantitatively. In the simplest approach we only keep the low-frequency behavior of the phonon self-energy with one free parameter, plus an adjustable UV cutoff. In the more realistic approach we keep the full frequency dependence of the phonon self-energy as dictated by the phonon-dislocation interaction plus an additional contribution due to scattering with point defects, with a cutoff set by the typical interatomic spacing of the material. We obtain a satisfactory description of thermal conductivity data with both approaches. We conclude by discussing prospects to test the predictive power of this model.</description>

      <title>Beta-AlGaO/Ga2O3 Tri-Gate MOSHEMT with 70GHz fT and 55GHz fmax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report Beta-AlGaO/Ga2O3 tri-gate heterostructure MOSHEMTs incorporating a thin 5 nm Al2O3 gate oxide layer for improved gate control and reduced leakage. The devices were fabricated on AlGaO/GaO heterostructures grown by ozone MBE on Fe-doped Ga2O3 (010) substrates. The tri-gate MOSHEMTs, with 1 micron-wide fins and Lg=155 nm, exhibit a peak current-gain cut-off frequency fT=70 GHz and a power-gain cut-off frequency fMAX=55 GHz.The fT.L product of 10.85 GHz-micron is the highest among reported Ga2O3 FETs to date. The devices show Vth =-0.5 V, an on/off ratio 10^6 I=80 mA/mm, a peak gm=60 mS/mm, and a low gate leakage current of 10^(-10) mA/mm at Vgs=0.5 V. Passivation with a 100 nm ALD Al2O3 layer effectively removes DC/RF dispersion and maintains stable operation under pulsed IV and repeated RF measurements. These results demonstrate the potential of tri-gate AlGaO/GaO MOSHEMTs for next-generation high-frequency and high-power applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an electron confined between conducting planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two of the most iconic systems of quantum physics are the particle in a box and the Coulomb potential (the third is, of course, the harmonic oscillator). In this expository paper, we consider the quantum solution to the problem of an electron confined between the grounded planes of an infinite capacitor. The potential arises from the image charges that form in the grounded planes, along with the added condition that at x = 0, L, where L is the distance between the planes, the wavefunction must be zero. This effectively couples a hydrogen like system to a particle-in-a-box (PIB) based on L, the distance between the planes. The problem of finding the electrostatic potential of this infinite series of image charges is an old one, going back to at least 1929. Here, we give a short derivation for one of the limiting cases that yields a compact expression and show how the Kellogg infinite summation formula converges to that value. We note here that this potential is a symmetric double well potential, so there will be many familiar properties of its solutions. Then using that potential, we solve Schr\"odinger's equation using a spectral technique. The limiting forms of a particle in a box for small L (and high E), and that of a (degenerate) bound image charge at large L and small energy are recovered. We also discuss the tunneling level splitting that occurs in the transition from the large L to the small L regime.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Negative-U Centers in Freestanding LaAlO3/SrTiO3 Micro-membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) interface hosts a rich range of electronic phenomena, including unconventional electron pairing that in quantum dots gives rise to a negative effective charging energy U. Here, we show freestanding LAO/STO micro-membranes naturally hosting negative-U centers, where lateral confinement arises intrinsically, rather than from engineered nanostructures. These centers coexist with gate-tunable superconductivity and can remain stable upon thermal cycling from millikelvin temperatures to room temperature. Transport is in excellent agreement with calculations based on a negative-U Anderson model, and electrostatic simulations indicate characteristic center sizes of 20-80 nm. Our findings suggest that negative-U centers may arise from the intrinsic interfacial inhomogeneity typical of LAO/STO, and should therefore be considered a general feature of the LAO/STO interface. This could have important consequences for the microwave response of interfacial superconducting devices.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally determine the coupling strength between two strongly coupled nanomechanical modes using a Ramsey-inspired technique optimized for signals as short as four fringes. The method is applied to precisely probe the change of the coupling rate induced by a modification of the microwave-cavity readout field.

      <description>arXiv:2601.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, quantum entanglement has been presented as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information, where sheafification provides a functor that is forgetful with regards to global-from-local signatures while acting faithfully with respect to within-patch multipartite structures. Nontrivial connections to Hecke modifications and the geometric Langlands program are explored in the process. The aim of this work is to validate and extend a number of the claims made in [arXiv:2511.04326] through both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, employing concrete perspectives from condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Revealing mesoscale bubble and particle dynamics in ultrasound-driven multiphase fluids by ultrafast synchrotron X-ray radiography and hybrid modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphase fluid flows comprising of mesoscale solid particles, liquid droplets, or gas bubbles are common in both natural and man-made systems, but quantifying the energy transfer is challenging due to complex bubble-particle interactions. In this study, we used ultrafast synchrotron X-ray imaging to study the mesoscale dynamic interactions among ultrasonic cavitation bubbles and hydrophobic particles or clusters. Critical dynamic information and data were extracted from the vast amount of X-ray images and then fed into the hybrid analytical-numerical model for calculating the energy transfer from the oscillating bubble and the imploding bubble to the nearby hydrophobic particles. Using the Ni spherical microparticles as an example, at bubble oscillation approximately 16% (80-320 nJ) of the local energy was transferred to the particle. At bubble implosion, the transferred energy increased approximately 26% (0.135-1.09 uJ). Local energy transfer occurred on timescales of 1 us to 1 ms and length scales of 1 um to 1 mm. Within each ultrasound cycle, kinetic and potential energy underwent complex exchanges, with local energy exhibiting a stepwise decay at the end of each cycle. The transferred energy was mainly consumed for enabling highly efficient particle dispersion. This research provides quantitative insights into optimizing hydrophobic nanomaterial dispersion and has broader implications for interfacial energy transfer processes such as making suspensions, composite materials and exfoliated 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Efficient local classification of parity-based material topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the classification of crystalline materials can be generally handled by momentum-space-based approaches, topological classification of aperiodic materials remains an outstanding challenge, as the absence of translational symmetry renders such conventional approaches inapplicable. Here, we present a numerically efficient real-space framework for classifying parity-based $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology in aperiodic systems based on the spectral localizer framework and the direct computation of the sign of a Pfaffian associated with a large sparse skew-symmetric matrix. Unlike projector-based or momentum-space-based approaches, our method does not rely on translational symmetry, spectral gaps in the Hamiltonian's bulk, or gapped auxiliary operators such as spin projections, and instead provides a local, energy-resolved topological invariant accompanied by an intrinsic measure of topological protection. A central contribution of this work is the development of a scalable sparse factorization algorithm that enables the reliable determination of the Pfaffian's sign for large sparse matrices, making the approach practical to realistic physical materials. We apply this framework to identify the quantum spin Hall effect in quasicrystalline class AII systems, including gapless heterostructures, and to diagnose fragile topology in a large $C_2 \mathcal{T}$-symmetric photonic quasicrystal. Overall, our results demonstrate that the spectral localizer, combined with efficient sparse numerical methods, provides a unified and robust tool for diagnosing parity-based topological phases in aperiodic electronic, photonic, and acoustic materials where conventional band-theoretic indexes are inapplicable.</description>

Abstract: Topological states of matter in disordered systems without translation symmetry have attracted great interest in recent years. These states with topological characters are not only robust against certain disorders, but also can be counterintuitively induced by disorders from a topologically trivial phase in the clean limit. In this review, we summarize the current theoretical and experimental progress on disorder-induced topological phases in both condensed-matter and artificial systems. We first introduce the topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) induced by random disorders and their topological characterizations and experimental realizations. We then discuss various extensions of TAIs with unique localization phenomena in quasiperiodic and non-Hermitian systems. We also review the theoretical and experimental studies on the disorder-induced topology in dynamical and many-body systems, including topological Anderson-Thouless pumps, disordered correlated topological insulators and average-symmetry protected topological orders acting as interacting TAI phases. Finally, we conclude the review by highlighting potential directions for future explorations.</description>

      <title>When electrons meet ferroelastic domain walls in Strontium Titanate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$), famously described by Nobel laureate K. A. M\"uller as the "drosophila of solid-state physics", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Nanoribbons for High-Performance Electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) field-effect transistors (FETs), with their atomically thin bodies, are promising candidates for future gate-all-around (GAA) nanoribbon architectures. While state-of-the-art Si GAA nanoribbon transistors feature channel widths in the tens of nanometers, most reported TMD-based FETs remain limited to micrometer-scale dimensions, limiting their relevance for ultra-scaled electronics. In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering. To further demonstrate the scalability of the nanoribbon device, we evaluate the variability of extremely scaled monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon transistor arrays featuring a contact pitch of 60 nm and an effective oxide thickness (EOT) of approximately 0.9 nm. Beyond MoS2, we extend the nanoribbon structure to WS2 n-type and WSe2 p-type FETs, demonstrating a viable path toward complementary monolayer TMD nanoribbon FETs for future ultra-scaled electronics.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson insulator and reentrant topological transitions in a mosaic trimer lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic-potential-modulated mosaic trimer lattice. To begin with, we first investigate the topological properties of the model in the clean limit free of quasiperiodic disorder based on analytical derivation and numerical calculations of the Zak phase $Z$ and the polarization $P$. Two nontrivial topological phases corresponding to the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling, respectively, are revealed. Then we incorporate the mosaic modulation and investigate the influence of quasiperiodic disorder on the two existing topological phases. Interestingly, it turns out that quasiperiodic disorder gives rise to multiple distinct effects for different fillings. At $2/3$ filling, the topological phase is significantly enhanced by the quasiperiodic disorder and topological Anderson insulator emerges. Based on the calculations of polarization and energy gap, we explicitly present corresponding topological phase diagram in the $\lambda-J$ plane. While for the $1/3$ filling case, % the topological phase is dramatically suppressed by the same quasiperiodic disorder. the quasiperiodic disorder dramatically compresses the topological phase, and strikingly, further induces the emergence of reentrant topological phase transitions instead. Furthermore, we verify the topological phase diagrams by computing the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility for both the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling cases. Our work exemplifies the diverse roles of quasiperiodic disorder in the modulation of topological properties, and will further inspire more research on the competitive and cooperative interplay between topological properties and quasiperiodic disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real and imaginary parts define the quantum metric and Berry curvature, encodes the intrinsic geometry of quantum states. While electronic QGT has been directly observed and linked to various phenomena like electron-phonon coupling, its bosonic analogue remains both theoretically and experimentally unexplored. We demonstrate that the dynamical structure factor directly encodes the full QGT throughout the Brillouin zone, establishing it as a sensitive probe of both quantum metric and Berry curvature. Applying this framework, we uncover clear geometric signatures in a twofold quadruple Weyl phonon in BaPtGe and the node-line magnon in Gd. Our results establish a general, direct route to measuring quantum geometry in bosonic systems, a crucial step toward elucidating its impact on condensed matter phenomena.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of altermagnetism, the collinear magnetic phase characterized by momentum-dependent spin-split bands but zero net magnetization, has fundamentally reshaped the classification of magnetic order. We propose an altermagnetic (AM) order in a repulsive Hubbard model on the Lieb-$5$ lattice. Considering only nearest-neighbor hoppings within the lattice, we show a phase transition from the nonmagnetic to a unique AM isolated band metal phase (AMIM), allowing clear identification of spin-split states. Additionally, the AM metallic phase (AMM) is also shown to appear as an intermediate phase during the transition from the normal metal to the AMIM in the presence of the diagonal hopping within each unit cell of the Lieb-$5$ lattice. The manifestation of distinct AM phases and the phase transitions, driven by Hubbard interaction and hopping integrals, have been explored in terms of spin-resolved band structure, spectral function, and the behavior of the AM order parameter. The stability of these AM phases against the spin-orbit coupling and temperature is also established.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Tunable Band Gap in Commensurate Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

Abstract: Bernal bilayer graphene exhibits a band gap that is tunable through the infrared with an electric field. We show that sublattice odd commensurate twisted bilayer graphene (C-TBG) exhibits a band gap that is tunable through the terahertz with an electric field. We show that from the perspective of terahertz optics the sublattice odd and even forms of C-TBG are "inflated" versions of Bernal and AA stacked bilayer graphene respectively with energy scales reduced by a factor of 110 for the 21.79 degree commensurate unit cell. This lower energy scale is accompanied by a correspondingly smaller gate voltage, which means that the strong-field regime is more easily accessible than in the Bernal case. Finally, we show that the interlayer coherence energy is a directly accessible experimental quantity through the position of a power-law divergence in the optical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Circular Dichroism in Commensurate Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report calculations of terahertz ellipticities in large-angle, 21.79$^\circ$ and 38.21$^\circ$, commensurate twisted bilayer graphene, and predict values as high as 1.5 millidegrees in the terahertz region for this non-magnetic material. This terahertz circular dichroism exhibits a magnitude comparable to that of chiral materials in the visible region. At low frequencies, the dichroic response is mediated by strong interlayer hybridization, which allows us to probe the symmetry and strength of these couplings. Crucially, lateral interlayer translation tunes this response, in contrast to small twist angle bilayer graphene's near invariance under under interlayer translation. We examine the magnitude and phase of the interlayer coupling for all structures containing fewer than 400 atoms per unit cell. Finally, we find that the dichroism can be manipulated by applying an electric field or with doping.</description>

      <title>Light-enhanced nonlinear Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18038v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that a nontrivial Chern number results in quantized Hall conductance. What is less known is that, generically, the Hall response can be dramatically different from its quantized value in materials with broken inversion symmetry. This stems from the leading Hall contribution beyond the linear order, known as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). While the BCD is in principle always present, it is typically very small outside of a narrow window close to a topological transition and is thus experimentally elusive without careful tuning of external fields, temperature, or impurities. In this work, we transcend this challenge by devising optical driving and quench protocols that enable practical and direct access to large BCD and nonlinear Hall responses. Varying the amplitude of an incident circularly polarized laser drives a topological transition between normal and Chern insulator phases, and importantly allows the precise unlocking of nonlinear Hall currents comparable to or larger than the linear Hall contributions. This strong BCD engineering is even more versatile with our two-parameter quench protocol, as demonstrated in our experimental proposal. Our predictions are expected to hold qualitatively across a broad range of Hall materials, thereby paving the way for the controlled engineering of nonlinear electronic properties in diverse media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13099v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-magnon coupling at the interface between a normal metal and a magnetically ordered insulator modifies the electrical conductivity of the normal metal, an effect known as spin-Hall magnetoresistance. It can also facilitate magnon-mediated electric current drag, the nonlocal electric current response of two normal metal layers separated by a magnetic insulator. Additionally, spin and heat transport are coupled both in the magnetic insulator and across the interfaces to normal metals. In this article, we present a theory of these spintronic and spin-caloritronic effects for time-dependent applied electric fields $E(\omega)$, with driving frequencies $\omega$ up to the THz regime. Our model describes how the dominant transport mechanism, coherent or incoherent magnons, evolves with the driving frequency $\omega$.</description>

      <title>Imaging the transition from diffusive to Landauer resistivity dipoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A point-like defect in a uniform current-carrying conductor induces a dipole in the electrochemical potential, which counteracts the original transport field. If the mean free path of the carriers is much smaller than the size of the defect, the dipole results from the purely diffusive motion of the carriers around the defect. In the opposite limit, ballistic carriers scatter from the defect$-$for this situation, Rolf Landauer postulated the emergence of residual resistivity dipoles that are independent of the defect size and thus impose a fundamental limit on the resistance of the parent conductor. Here, we study resistivity dipoles around holes of different sizes in two-dimensional Bi films on Si(111). Using scanning tunneling potentiometry to image the dipoles, we find a crossover from linear to constant scaling behavior of their amplitudes with defect size, manifesting the transition from diffusive to Landauer dipoles. The extracted parameters of the transition allow us to estimate the Fermi wave vector and the carrier mean free path in our Bi films.</description>

      <title>Coupling of plasmons to the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of magnons and plasmons offers a promising avenue for hybrid quantum systems, facilitating coherent energy and information transfer between magnetic and charge excitations. However, existing mechanisms often depend on spin-orbit coupling or temperature-activated processes, limiting their robustness for low-temperature quantum technologies. Here, we propose a coupling mechanism between plasmons and the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnetic insulators, which operates at zero temperature and does not require spin-orbit coupling. Using a model system consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas on an insulating antiferromagnetic substrate, we show that the electric field of the plasmons interacts with the magnetically mediated electric polarization in the antiferromagnet, arising from bonds with broken inversion symmetry. This interaction enables a strong coupling to the spin-conserving two-magnon continuum, allowing for efficient hybridization and reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for investigating exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the atomic-scale synthesis of goldene, a monolayer of elemental gold atoms arranged in a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the formation of kagome goldene, featuring a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, signaling strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band is disrupted at the zigzag edges of goldene nanoflakes, revealing substantial edge effects. Furthermore, our calculations show that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the underlying Au2Ge substrate generate dual Dirac nodal lines through a proximity effect. These findings offer not only a novel strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices, but also a generalizable framework for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This research advances the exploration of quantum phases driven by strong correlations and the design of materials for next-generation quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Coherent suppression and dephasing-induced reentrance of high harmonics in gapped Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying material properties and ultra-fast electron dynamics, where its coherent character is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we uncover a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs. inter-band contributions. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space in gapped systems with both linear dispersion, such as for massive Dirac Fermions, and with quadratic dispersion, as e.g. for bilayer graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that, upon increasing dephasing, destructive interference between intra- and inter-band contributions is lifted. This leads to reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics, i.e. a crossover from the characteristic spectral "shoulder" to a slowly decaying signal involving much higher harmonics. We supplement our numerical observations with analytical results for the one-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Valley Splitting Correlations Across a Silicon Quantum Well Containing Germanium</title>

Abstract: Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array, formed in a Si$_{0.972}$Ge$_{0.028}$ quantum well, manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and &gt;1$\mu$m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design.</description>

Abstract: Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.</description>

Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the conductance of a one dimensional free electron gas in double exchange interaction with a classical conical magnet. We find integer conductance steps depending on the energy window of the incoming electrons for conical magnets described by a fictitious magnetic field of different orientations and modulated profile. The conductance windows, that we attribute to potential or diffractive scattering, are characterised by spin selectivity depending on the fictitious magnetic field direction and chirality. Furthermore, we study the conductance of a conical soliton lattice and discuss a rationalization of all the conductance data for an incoming electron with arbitrary spin direction in terms of scattering of an electron with spin along the conical axis.</description>

      <title>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02192v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices. In these systems, topological edge states (TESs) have been reported in higher-energy magnon gaps, while the first magnon gap is found to be topologically trivial. In this context, antiferromagnetic (AFM) SkXs on the triangular spin lattice have been considered potentially more interesting for applications, since TESs emerge already in the first magnon gap. Meanwhile, the magnon topology of SkXs stabilized on non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the magnon band structure and TESs in 2D FM SkXs stabilized on the honeycomb spin lattice, including experimentally motivated parameter sets relevant to van der Waals magnets. We show that chiral TESs emerge in the first magnon gap over significant ranges of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Magnetic-field-driven topological phase transitions modify the number of these TESs before eventually trivializing them. In addition, we find that TESs can coexist in the first and higher magnon gaps, which could enable frequency-multiplexed magnonic edge transport. These findings highlight the role of lattice geometry in shaping the magnon topology and edge transport in noncollinear spin textures.</description>

      <title>Tunable spin-phonon polarons in a chiral molecular qubit framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. These quasiparticles are speculated to be the origin of chirality-induced spin selectivity and presumably can display exotic dynamic behaviors. However, direct experimental evidence of spin-phonon polarons has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests itself as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence or quantum sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Marginal Metals and Kosterlitz-Thouless Type Phase Transition in Disordered Altermagnets</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently discovered magnetic phase characterized by spin-split bands without net magnetization, has emerged as promising platform for novel physics and potential applications. However, its stability against disorder-ubiquitous in real materials-remains poorly understood. Here, we study the electron localization properties of two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets subject to disorder. Remarkably, we discover a disorder-driven phase transition from a marginal metallic phase to an insulator, which falls into the Kosterlitz-Thouless class. We demonstrate this by strong numerical evidence and propose an interpretation in terms of vortex-antivortex pairs in the disorder-induced local in-plane spin magnetization. Moreover, we show that the characteristic spin anisotropy of altermagnets persists but gradually fades away across the transition. These changes directly affect the spin splitting features that are detectable in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tunneling magnetoconductance. Our findings provide a new perspective on recent experimental observations of altermagnetism in candidate materials.</description>

      <title>Realistic modelling of transport properties at finite temperature in magnetic materials by local quantization of a Heisenberg model</title>

Abstract: The quantitative description of the electrical resistivity of a magnetic material remains challenging to this day. Qualitatively, it is well understood that the temperature-induced lattice and spin disorder determines the temperature dependence of the resistivity. While prior publications reached good agreement with experiment in the so-called supercell or direct approach for non-magnetic materials where the spin-disorder contribution to the resistivity is negligible, an accurate, purely theoretical description of magnetic materials remains elusive. This shortcoming can be attributed to the missing accuracy in the description of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder itself. In this work, we employ a joint approach from \textit{ab-initio} transport calculations and atomistic modeling of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder. Using the example of $\alpha$-Fe, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum mechanical effects using a semiclassical local quantization of the Heisenberg model significantly improves the description of the spin-disorder component to the electrical resistivity. Compared to previous approaches, this model includes the description of magnetic short-range order effects, enabling us to study temperature effects around and above the Curie temperature, where prior mean-field theory-based approaches inevitably predicted a constant contribution.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum metric of 3D topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface states of 3D topological insulators possess geometric structures that imprint distinctive signatures on electronic transport. A prime example is the Berry curvature, which controls, for instance, electric frequency doubling via its higher order moments. In addition to the Berry curvature, topological surface states are expected to exhibit a nontrivial quantum metric, which plays a key role in governing nonlinear magnetotransport. However, its manifestation has yet to be experimentally observed and controlled in 3D topological insulators. Here, we provide evidence for a nonlinear response activated by the quantum metric of the topological surface states of Sb$_2$Te$_3$. We measure a time-reversal odd, nonlinear magnetoresistance that is independent from the temperature and the scattering time below 30 K, and is thus of intrinsic geometrical origin. This quantum metric magnetoresistance can be controlled by tuning the contributions of the top and bottom topological surface states by voltage gating. Our measurements thus demonstrate the existence and tunability of quantum geometry-induced transport in topological phases of matter and provide strategies for designing novel functionalities in topological devices.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Spin-Wave Nonreciprocity of a Crescent-Shaped Nanowire via Curvature and Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies on spin-wave propagation in ferromagnetic waveguides has highlighted the role of nonreciprocity resulting from the chiral nature of dipolar interactions in curved elements. However, the impact of spin-wave mode type on nonreciprocity remains unexplored. Using micromagnetic simulations supported by analytical modeling, we systematically analyzed the propagation of edge, fundamental, and width-quantized spin-wave modes in a ferromagnetic nanowire with a crescent-shaped cross-section. Our results show that the strength and sign of nonreciprocity depend on the mode type, as well as on the curvature magnitude of the nanowire's top and bottom surfaces and the strength of the external magnetic field. Interestingly, changing the mode type, for instance induced by altering the curvature or magnetic field, result in a significant change in the dispersion relation asymmetry. This effect underscores the important role of spin-wave profiles in nonreciprocity, deepens our fundamental understanding of spin-wave dynamics in curved geometries, and paves the way for designing magnonic waveguides with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Majorana zero modes mediated by gapless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the decoherence of a collection of Majorana zero modes weakly coupled to a gapless reservoir of non-interacting fermions. Using the Born-Markov approximation, we derive a Lindblad master equation for the dissipative dynamics of the Majorana zero modes. Due to the long-range coupling between Majorana zero modes mediated by the gapless reservoir, the Lindblad jump operators are non-local linear combinations of the Majorana operators. We show that, as a consequence, the dissipative dynamics can exhibit long relaxation times, i.e. a slow decay of fermion parities. A spectral analysis of the Liouvillian shows that the slow-down is suppressed as a power law of the distance between Majorana zero modes. Finally, we validate the Lindblad equation by comparison with unbiased numerical simulations of the time evolution of the full density matrix. In particular, these illustrate that non-Markovian dynamics establishes non-local correlations at small times.</description>

      <title>New perspective on symmetry breaking in a clean antiferromagnetic chain: Spin-selective transport and NDR phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary requirement for achieving spin-selective electron transfer in a nanojunction possessing a magnetic system with zero net magnetization is to break the symmetry between the up and down spin sub-Hamiltonians. Circumventing the available approaches, in the present work, we put forward a new mechanism for symmetry breaking by introducing a bias drop along the functional element. To demonstrate this, we consider a clean magnetic chain with antiparallel alignment of neighboring magnetic moments. The junction is modeled within a tight-binding framework, and spin-dependent transmission probabilities are evaluated using wave-guide theory. The corresponding current components are obtained through the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. Selective spin currents, exhibiting a high degree of spin polarization, are obtained over a wide bias region. Moreover, the bias-dependent transmission profile exhibits negative differential resistance (NDR), another important aspect of our study. We examine the results under three different potential profiles, one linear and two non-linear, and in each case, we observe a favorable response. This work may offer a new route for designing efficient spintronic devices based on bias-controlled magnetic systems with vanishing net magnetization.</description>

      <title>Geometry induced net spin polarization of $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit spin-split electronic bandstructures despite having zero net magnetization, making them attractive for field-free spintronic applications. In this work, we show that a finite rectangular altermagnetic sample can acquire a net spin polarization purely due to its geometry. This effect arises from the interplay between the anisotropic, spin-resolved Fermi contours of an altermagnet and the discrete sampling of momentum space imposed by unequal sample dimensions. By explicitly counting occupied states, we demonstrate that rectangular samples with $L_x \neq L_y$ host a finite spin polarization, which vanishes in the symmetric limit $L_x=L_y$ and in the thermodynamic limit. We further show that this geometry-induced spin polarization can be directly probed in transport measurements. In the tunneling regime, the charge and the spin conductances exhibit characteristic patterns as a function of sample dimensions, faithfully reflecting the underlying spin polarization. In addition, transport across ferromagnet--altermagnet--ferromagnet junctions reveals an asymmetric magnetoresistance with respect to reversal of the Zeeman field, providing an independent transport signature of the finite spin polarization. Our results establish geometry as an effective control parameter for spin polarization in altermagnets and suggest a viable route for exploiting finite-size effects in mesoscopic altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: A recent STM experiment in 2D bilayer graphene [Y.-C. Tsui, et al., Nature 628, 287 (2024)], under a strong perpendicular magnetic field, has made a direct observation of the existence of three distinct filling-factor-dependent quantum phases in the lowest Landau level: the incompressible fractional quantum Hall liquid, a crystalline compressible hexagonal Wigner crystal with long-range order and rotational symmetry-breaking, and a random localized solid phase with no spatial order. We argue that the spatially random localized phase at low filling is the recently proposed disorder-dominated strongly localized amorphous "Anderson solid" phase [A. Babber, et al., arXiv:2601.03521], which appears generically at a sample-dependent filling factor.</description>

      <title>Molecularly Thin Polyaramid Nanomechanical Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional polyaramids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding to create molecularly thin nanosheets analogous to graphene. Here, we report the first nanomechanical resonators made out of a two-dimensional polyaramid, 2DPA-1, with thicknesses as small as 8 nm. To fabricate these molecular-scale resonators, we transferred nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips with previously etched arrays of circular microwells. We then characterized the thermal resonances of these resonators under different conditions. When there is no residual gas inside the 2DPA-1-covered microwells, the eigenfrequencies are well-described by a tensioned plate theory, providing the Young's modulus and tension of the 2DPA-1 nanofilms. With gas present, the nanofilms bulge up and mechanical resonances are modified due to the adhesion, bulging and slack present in the system. The fabrication and mechanical characterization of these first 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators represent a convincing path toward molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with high mechanical strength, low density, and synthetic processability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically characterize the dynamical evolution of time-parity (PT )-symmetric two-level systems with spin-dependent dissipations. If the control parameters of the gap are linearly tuned with time, the dynamical evolution can be characterized with parabolic cylinder equations which can be analytically solved. We find that the asymptotic behaviors of particle probability on the two levels show initial-state-independent redistribution in the slow-tuning-speed limit as long as the system is nonadiabatically driven across exceptional points. Equal distributions appear when the nondissipative Hamiltonian shows gap closing. So long as the nondissipative Hamiltonian displays level anticrossing, the final distribution becomes unbalanced. The ratios between the occupation probabilities are given analytically. These results are confirmed with numerical simulations. The predicted equal distribution phenomenon may be used to identify the closing of the energy gap from anti-crossing between two energy bands.</description>

      <title>Anomalous quantized nonlinear Thouless pumping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed that a soliton resulting from nonlinearity can be pumped across an integer or fractional number of unit cells as a system parameter is slowly varied over a pump period. Nonlinear Thouless pumping is now understood as the flow of instantaneous Wannier functions, ruling out the possibility of pumping a soliton across a nonzero number of unit cells over one cycle when a corresponding Wannier function does not exhibit any flow, i.e., when the corresponding Bloch band that the soliton bifurcates from is topologically trivial. Here we surprisingly find an anomalous nonlinear Thouless pump where the displacement of a soliton over one cycle differs from the Chern number of the Bloch band from which the soliton comes. We develop a general theory showing that this anomalous behavior arises from a transition of a soliton between different Wannier functions by passing through an intersite-soliton (or dipole-soliton) state. Furthermore, we find a nonlinearity-induced integer quantized Thouless pump of a soliton, allowing a soliton to travel across one unit cell during a pump period, even when the corresponding band is topologically trivial. Our results open the door to studying nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons.</description>

      <title>Cascades in transport and optical conductivity of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr\"odinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael et al. [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75-91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode - an explicitly open quantum system - are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</description>

Abstract: We study the properties of photons in a cryogenic cavity, made by cryo-cooled mirrors surrounded by a room temperature environment. We model such a system as a multimode cavity coupled to two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. Using a Lindblad master equation approach, we derive the photon distribution and the statistical properties of the cavity modes, finding an overall non-thermal state described by a mode-dependent effective temperature. We also calculate the dissipation rates arising from the interaction of the cavity field with the external environment and the mirrors, relating such rates to measurable macroscopic quantities. These results provide a simple theory to calculate the dissipative properties and the effective temperature of a cavity coupled to different thermal reservoirs, offering potential pathways for engineering dissipations and photon statistics in cavity settings.</description>

Abstract: Electronic flicker noise limits phase stability in communication systems, reduces the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors, and degrades coherence in quantum devices. There is a strong need for unconventional materials and strategies for achieving ultra-low-noise performance in nanoscale and quantum electronics. Here, we demonstrate that in nanowires of the quasi-one-dimensional, fully gapped charge-density-wave material (TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of thermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density decreases linearly with current, I -- a striking departure from the constant value observed in conventional conductors. No residual minimum noise level is reached for the current of the electron-lattice condensate in (TaSe4)2I nanowires. Repeating the measurements for another charge-density wave conductor, NbS3-II, we found a similar reduction below the normal electron limit at room temperature. Our findings signal intrinsically lower current fluctuations within a correlated electron transport regime.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum motion of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator with a radio-frequency superconducting qubit</title>

Abstract: Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime are a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated coherent interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of $21~\mathrm{\mu K}$ and read out with 77% single-shot fidelity. During the $6~\mathrm{ms}$ lifetime of the membrane the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective qubit detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the position noise spectrum of the membrane, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at $10~\mathrm{mK}$ and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</description>
