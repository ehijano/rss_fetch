      <title>Incompleteness in Quantified Conditional Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stalnaker and Thomason famously proved that the conditional logic \textsf{C2} with first-order quantifiers is complete with respect to a selection function semantics. However, the selection functions used in this completeness result take formulas, rather than propositions (i.e., sets of worlds), as arguments. Yet Stalnaker has repeatedly emphasized the philosophical importance of viewing selection functions as functions on propositions, and many of the applications of his theory require this. Can their completeness result be extended to a selection function semantics in which the functions take propositions as arguments? We prove the answer is negative: Their logic is frame incomplete. Moreover, this result is invariant with respect to many choice points regarding the semantics, such as variable vs.~constant domains or whether to include an identity or existence predicate. We conclude by discussing some of the important and difficult questions for the philosophical and logical study of conditionals that our results raise.</description>

      <title>Elementary extensions of almost o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates almost o-minimal structures, a weakening of o-minimality introduced by Fujita to capture structures that lie outside the classical o-minimal framework. In contrast to o-minimality and local o-minimality, almost o-minimality is not preserved under elementary equivalence. This raises the natural question of whether every almost o-minimal structure admits a proper elementary extension that is again almost o-minimal. The main result of this paper provides an affirmative answer to this question.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's tenth problem for finitely generated rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This expository article covers the recent developments surrounding Hilbert's tenth problem for finitely generated rings. We start by recounting the history of Hilbert's tenth problem over the integers, which was resolved negatively by Matiyasevich--Robinson--Davis--Putnam in 1970. In order to pass from $\mathbb{Z}$ to the finitely generated setting, we explain a criterion of Poonen that connects this to a problem in the theory of elliptic curves. Finally, we outline the main ideas behind the recent resolution of this elliptic curve problem by the authors.</description>

      <title>Intentic Semantics for Potentialist Truthmaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This draft introduces the technical machinery of a semantic framework for potentialist truthmaking based on our innovation of intentic states, which are structured partial models accounting for our distinction between non-hypothetical and hypothetical reasoning. The framework is developed for first-order logic in a purely relational language and is compatible with both classical and intuitionistic settings. Truthmaking is defined via a recursive construction over intentic states, yielding a semantic consequence relation that is shown to be sound and complete with respect to standard natural deduction. The resulting structure supports two natural extension relations, corresponding to truthmaking growth and hypothetical refinement, which are shown to satisfy the axioms governing Linnebo's bi-modal potentialist semantics.
  Moreover, we investigate the computational properties of the non-hypothetical fragment of natural deduction. Motivated by proof-theoretic and semantic considerations, we formulate a conjecture that non-hypothetical logic is decidable over Peano Arithmetic in a purely relational axiomatization, and more ambitiously over any fixed Peano Arithmetic theorem taken as an additional axiom. A schematic proof-search procedure is drafted to support this conjecture, identifying structural sources of finiteness. While preliminary, this analysis suggests a strong subformula discipline for normal non-hypothetical proofs and provides a proof-theoretic foundation for future work.</description>

      <title>Structured sunflowers and Ramsey properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A first-order structure $M$ is said to have the infinite sunflower property if, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}_+$ and each structure $M' \cong M$ whose elements are $k$-sets, there is $S \subseteq M'$, $S \cong M$, such that $S$ is a sunflower: a collection of sets such that each pair of distinct elements has the same intersection. A class $\mathcal{K}$ of finite structures is said to have the finite sunflower property if for all $k \in \mathbb{N}_+$ and $B \in \mathcal{K}$, there is $C \in \mathcal{K}$ such that any $C' \cong C$ whose elements consist of $k$-sets contains a copy of $B$ which is a sunflower. These two notions were introduced by Ackerman, Karker and Mirabi in a recent paper, and give a structural generalisation of the well-known Erd\H{o}s-Rado sunflower lemma for sets. We characterise the infinite sunflower property for countable ultrahomogeneous relational structures with strong amalgamation in terms of a certain vertex-partition property related to indivisibility, generalising and connecting some results of Ackerman, Karker and Mirabi in the countable ultrahomogeneous context, and we show that all free amalgamation classes with a single vertex isomorphism-type have the finite sunflower property. We give a variety of examples and further observations.</description>

      <title>Strong Normalization for the Safe Fragment of a Minimal Rewrite System: A Triple-Lexicographic Proof and a Conjecture on the Unprovability of Full Termination for Any Relational Operator-Only TRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents KO7, a minimal operator-only term rewriting system with seven constructors and eight reduction rules, designed to investigate self-verifying computation. No external axioms, imported logic, or pre-existing arithmetic are used.
  Standard termination methods fail on this system. We document ten proof strategies that collapse at the same barrier: duplication of the step argument in the recursor. The rec-succ rule redistributes its argument into both the function application and the recursive call, defeating every additive measure. This failure is not a defect but a necessary feature of any system capable of sequential computation.
  To resolve this, we define SafeStep, a guarded fragment restricted by a delta-phase bit. For this fragment, a novel triple-lexicographic measure (combining phase bits, Dershowitz-Manna multiset ordering, and ordinal ranking) succeeds, supporting a mechanically verified normalizer with proven totality and soundness.
  We state a fundamental conjecture: No relational operator-only TRS can have its full-system termination proved by internally definable methods. A relational TRS is one capable of internalized sequential computation, a property shared by Turing machines, lambda calculus, and recursive functions. All such systems require a recursor that inherently creates the duplication barrier.
  This reveals Pre-Arithmetic Incompleteness. Unlike Goedel's theorems, which require arithmetic sufficient for encoding, this barrier appears at a more primitive layer: in operator systems possessing only order and recursion, before arithmetic emerges.
