      <title>Sensitivity of Photovoltaic Cells Efficiency to Initial Conditions in Various Aggregation Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is thought that nature already exploits quantum mechanical properties to increase the efficiency of solar energy harvesting devices. So, the operation of these devices can be enhanced by clever design of a nanoscopic, quantum mechanical system where the quantum coherence plays a crucial role in this process. In this investigation, we develop a donor-acceptor two-level trap dipole model converging the key role of quantum coherence and aggregation effects along with different initial states. Our analysis reveals that quenching unwanted emissions is achievable by preparing the system in specific initial state under the effect of optimal spatial aggregation. Interestingly it is observed that characterizing aggregation-induced properties and quantum effects of bandgap engineering can increase the power enhancement up to 35.87% compared with classical counterparts. This encouraging trend suggests a promising novel design aspect of nature-mimicking photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-broken metallic orders in spin-orbit-coupled Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore Bernal bilayer graphene in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, short-range Hund's coupling, and proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling using self-consistent Hartree-Fock simulations. We show that the interplay between these three ingredients produces an intricate phase diagram comprising a multitude of symmetry-broken metallic states tunable via doping and applied displacement field. In particular, we find intervalley coherent and spin-canted ground states that may hold the key to understanding spin-orbit-enabled superconductivity observed in this platform. We also investigate various phase transitions where a continuous $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry is broken to ascertain the possible role of critical fluctuations on pairing.</description>

      <title>Temperature limits of the transitional quantum dynamics in qubit clusters exposed to the ac field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the temperature limits of quantum coherence in the system representing a chain of coupled two-level systems (TLS) exposed to an electromagnetic field is complicated due to the adverse influence of noise. Such a system frequently serves as a basic element of various quantum devices. In the steady state, the quantum coherence in TLS is merely destroyed by noise, which intensifies as the temperature increases. The behavior is complicated when the external field is applied modulating also the noise. In this work, using the computerized model, we study the temperature limits of the transitional quantum dynamics in the all-electrically controlled graphene single-TLS and three-TLS devices exposed to the electromagnetic field. We analyze how the external ac field changes the state of the system and observe that it not only influences the coherent transport there but modifies the effect of noise. The conducted numerical experiments determine the conditions provided the quantum coherence in QC may be much prolonged even above the ambient room temperature which can improve the performance of various quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Heavy-hole spin relaxation in quantum dots: Isotropic versus anisotropic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-charge based logic in single-hole spin of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can be controlled by anisotropic gate potentials providing a notion for making next generation solid-state quantum devices. In this study, we investigate the isotropic and anisotropic behavior of phonon mediated spin relaxation of heavy-hole spin hot spots in QDs. For the electron spin in isotropic QDs, hot spots are known to be always present due to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. But for heavy holes in isotropic dots, we show that the occurrences of spin hot spots are sensitive to the bulk g-factor. The hot spot for Rashba coupling in InAs and GaSb dots arises because these materials possess negative bulk g-factor, while that for the Dresselhaus coupling in GaAs and InSb dots is found due to their positive bulk g-factor. For anisotropic QDs, on the other hand, the spin hot spot is universally present due to their broken in-plane rotational symmetry. Further, the increasing electric field, that strengthens the Rashba coupling, is shown to cover a wide range of magnetic field by the hot spots. Results demonstrate that the magnetic field, choice of dot materials and size anisotropy can act as effective control parameters which can be experimentally used to design the device for detecting the phonon mediated heavy-hole spin-relaxation behavior of III-V semiconductor QDs.</description>

      <title>Lattice-guided growth of dense arrays of aligned transition metal dichalcogenide nanoribbons with high catalytic reactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit unique properties and potential applications when reduced to one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons (NRs), owing to quantum confinement and high edge densities. However, effective growth methods for self-aligned TMD NRs are still lacking. We demonstrate a versatile approach for the lattice-guided growth of dense, aligned TMD NR arrays via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on anisotropic sapphire substrates, without the need for tailored surface steps. This method enables the synthesis of NRs with widths below 10 nm, with their longitudinal axis parallel to the zigzag direction. The growth is influenced by both the substrate and CVD temperature, indicating the role of anisotropic precursor diffusion and substrate interaction. The 1D nature of the NRs was asserted by the observation of Coulomb blockade at low temperature. Pronounced catalytic activity was observed at the edges of the NRs, indicating their promise for efficient catalysis.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced frequency pulling in CoFeB/Cu/Py double-vortex oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate piezostrain-induced frequency pulling in stacked double-vortex structures, magnetostatically coupled through the nonmagnetic spacer. We study the effect of the Cu spacer thickness on the strain-induced gyrotropic frequency shift in double-vortex structures comprising of magnetostrictive CoFeB and nonmagnetostricitve Py layers. For the two stacked vortices with different eigen-frequencies, the strain-induced magnetoelastic anisotropy leads to the downshift of the gyration frequency of the magnetostricitve vortex. We show that for increased dipolar coupling between the layers (i.e. decreased spacer thickness), a strain-induced frequency pulling regime is obtained, where the resonance frequency of the nonmagnetostrictive Py vortex is upshifted towards the gyration resonance of the magnetostrictive CoFeB vortex. This result offers an additional degree of freedom for the manipulation of the dynamical regimes and synchronization conditions in spintronic oscillators, controlled by voltage and tunable by strain</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study of the Photo-stimulated Radio-electric Effect in Asymmetric Semi-parabolic Quantum Wells in the Presence of a Laser Radiation Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, based on the quantum kinetic equation approach, we systematically present the radio-electric effect in asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells under the influence of a laser radiation field taking into account the electron-longitudinal optical phonon scattering mechanism. The numerical results show that the blue-shift of the maximum peaks in the photon energy range is less than 60 meV. The height of maximum peaks increases according to an exponential rule, depending nonlinearly on the structural parameters of the asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells. In the photon energy range greater than 100 meV, the saturated radio-electric field increases with temperature and geometric parameters of the quantum well. Temperature also strongly affects full-width at half-maximum with rules consistent with previous theoretical calculations and experimental observations. The results show the differences between symmetric and asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells, highlighting the influence of asymmetric structures on radio-electric effects in two-dimensional quantum well systems.</description>

      <title>Exact bulk-boundary correspondence of spectral winding topology under mixed boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex spectral winding is a topological feature unique in non-Hermitian systems and is known to be responsible for the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), namely, the sign of the spectral winding number predicts the localization direction of skin modes. In this paper, we analytically establish an exact bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) for the spectral winding topology by adopting mixed boundary conditions (MBCs). By presenting analytical solutions of a class of one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with nearest-neighbor hoppings identical for different components, we demonstrate that the emergence of skin modes further requires the absolute value of spectral winding number exceeding a threshold determined by the MBCs. In contrast to most topological phases, this exact BBC of spectral winding topology is not only robust against disorder, but also favored by it, as disorder can restore the correspondence in certain cases where it is originally violated. Finally, we extend our analysis to a more general model by relaxing the restriction on hopping parameters, verifying the universality of the exact BBC under MBCs.</description>

      <title>A general theory for infernal points in non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coalescence of eigenstates is a unique phenomena in non-Hermitian systems. Remarkably, it has been noticed in some non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions that the whole set of eigenstates can coalesce to only a few eigenstates. In the parameter space, the point at which such a coalescence of macroscopic eigenstates occurs is dubbed as an infernal point. In this paper, based on the non-Bloch band theory and amoeba formulation, we establish the criteria for the presence of infernal points in one-dimensional and higher dimensional open-boundary non-Hermitian systems. In addition, we find an explanation of the extreme localization of the wave functions and unveil the mechanism for the coalescence of enormous eigenstates at the infernal points. Our work provides a general theory for infernal points in open-boundary non-Hermitian systems in arbitrary dimensions, and hence paves the way to study the intriguing infernal points systematically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build Floquet-driven capactive circuit networks to realize topological states of matter in the frequency domain. We find the Floquet circuit network equations of motion to reveal a potential barrier which effectively acts as a boundary in frequency space. By implementing a Su-Shrieffer-Heeger Floquet lattice model and measuring the associated circuit Laplacian and characteristic resonances, we demonstrate how topological edge modes can nucleate at such a frequency boundary.</description>

      <title>Going beyond Landauer scattering theory to describe spatially-resolved non-local heating and cooling in quantum thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially-resolved heating and cooling in nanostructures is nowadays measured with various nanoscale thermometry techniques, including scanning thermometry. Yet the most commonly used theory of nanoscale heating and thermoelectricity -- Landauer scattering theory -- is not appropriate to model such measurements. Hence, we analyze a minimal model of spatially-resolved heat transfer between electrons and phonons in simple thermoelectric nanostructures. This combines Landauer scattering formalism with a Boltzmann equation for transport, revealing the non-locality of Joule heating and Peltier cooling induced by a scatterer in a nanowire. The corresponding heating or cooling of the phonons is caused by the voltage drop at the scatterer, but is often maximal at a certain distance from the scatterer. This distance is of the order of the electron-phonon scattering length. Scanning thermal microscopy, such as SQUID-on-tip thermometers, should detect this non-locality as phonon hot spots and cold spots, spatially separated from the scatterer. We provide physical arguments explaining the thermoelectric response of the combined system of wire and scatterer, and in particular, why the resulting heating and cooling is sometimes the opposite to that predicted by the standard Landauer scattering theory.</description>

      <title>Drag conductance induced by neutral-mode localization in fractional quantum Hall junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A junction of two 2/3 fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edges, with no charge tunneling between them, may exhibit Anderson localization of neutral modes. Manifestations of such localization in transport properties of the junction are explored. There are two competing localization channels, ``neutral-mode superconductivity'' and ``neutral-mode backscattering''. Localization in any of these channels leads to an effective theory of the junction that is characteristic for FQH effect of bosons, with a minimal integer excitation charge equal to two, and with elementary quasiparticle charge equal to 2/3. These values can be measured by studying shot noise in tunneling experiments. Under the assumption of ballistic transport in the arms connecting the junction to contacts, the two-terminal conductance of the junction is found to be 4/3 for the former localization channel and 1/3 for the latter. The four-terminal conductance matrix reveals in this regime a strong quantized drag between the edges induced by neutral-mode localization. The two localization channels lead to opposite signs of the drag conductance, equal to $\pm 1/4$, which can also be interpreted as a special type of Andreev scattering. Coherent random tunneling in arms of the device (which are segments of 2/3 edges) leads to strong mesoscopic fluctuations of the conductance matrix. In the case of fully equilibrated arms, transport via the junction is insensitive to neutral-mode localization: The two-terminal conductance is quantized to 2/3 and the drag is absent.</description>

      <title>Controlled fast wavepackets in non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the propagation of fast wavepackets in classical non-Hermitian lattices, where the group velocity is controlled by the non-Hermiticity parameters, and can be made higher than in the Hermitian counterpart. Specifically, we obtain a square root dependence of the group velocity on the gain/loss parameter, similarly to the dependence of quantum wavepackets in stretched graphene-like lattices subjected to gain and loss. We derive a targeted mapping from the quantum to the classical Hamiltonian to realize this phenomenon in a dynamically stable form. As a result, fast wavepackets of any frequency supported by the lattice are propagating in time domain with a non-growing amplitude. We demonstrate the system experimentally in a topoelectrical metamaterial, where the non-Hermiticity is generated by embedded operational amplifiers in a feedback setup. Our design paves the way to realize increased group velocities, and other wave phenomena inspired by quantum systems in a form that preserves the original system properties, while supporting an inherently stable dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial impact of interlayer coupling on thermal conductivity: opposing trends in in-plane and out-of-plane phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of heat transport in two-dimensional (2D) materials reveals novel behaviors due to quantum confinement effects, where in-plane and out-of-plane phonons play crucial roles. In 2D materials like graphene, it is widely recognized that the out-of-plane vibrational mode is the primary contributor to thermal conductivity owing to the mirror symmetry. Based on this perspective, the introduction of interlayer coupling, which breaks this symmetry, is expected to induce a significant reduction in thermal conductivity within 2D materials. Nevertheless, recent studies have presented unexpected findings, indicating that interlayer coupling can actually increase thermal conductivity of 2D materials. This controversial result suggests a nontrivial underlying mechanism governing the effects of interlayer coupling on thermal conductivity in 2D materials, necessitating further exploration. In our work, we investigate the modulation of thermal conductivity through interlayer coupling in a sandwich structure composed of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and bilayer graphene (BG), specifically a h- BN/BG/h-BN system. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the thermal conductivity from out-of-plane phonons can be significantly reduced, while that from in-plane phonons can be significantly increased, as the interlayer coupling strength increases. This results in a nontrivial, coupling-strength-dependent overall thermal conductivity. The phonon spectrum analysis conducted using our modified package reveals that the upshift and flattening of the out-of-plane (ZA and ZO) phonon modes are mainly responsible for these variations, and the extent of the upshift and flattening is proportional to the strength of interlayer coupling. This work offers new insights into manipulating the thermal conductivity of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Giant Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Magnetic Monolayers CrPX3 (X = S, Se, Te) due to symmetry breaking between the in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic axes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) has a crucial feature for developing highly sensitive sensors and innovative memory devices. While extensively studied in bulk materials, AMR effects in these materials are typically weak. Recent advancements indicate that two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnetic materials possess unique magnetic properties, potentially including significant AMR characteristics. In this study, we utilize density functional theory and the Boltzmann transport equation to investigate AMR in magnetic monolayers CrPX3 (X = S, Se, Te). Our findings reveal a substantially large AMR in these 2D magnetic compounds. This enhancement is attributed to magnetization (M)-dependent spin-orbit coupling (SOC), arising from the broken symmetry between in-plane and out-of-plane orientations. This results in significant M-dependent band splitting and subsequent variations in electron velocity. Additionally, we find that the M-dependent SOC is significantly enhanced by increasing the atomic number of the chalcogen X in CrPX3, achieving an exceptional 150% AMR in CrPTe3. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that AMR can be effectively modulated by applying biaxial strain, resulting in a twofold increase with a 4% strain. These findings propose a novel approach to enhancing 2D-based AMR spintronic devices, making a substantial contribution to the field.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: From Topology to Hall Effects -- Implications of Berry Phase Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berry phase is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics with profound implications for understanding topological properties of quantum systems. This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to the Berry phase, beginning with the essential mathematical framework required to grasp its significance. We explore the intrinsic link between the emergence of a non-trivial Berry phase and the presence of topological characteristics in quantum systems, showing the connection between the Berry phase and the band structure as well as the phase's gauge-invariant nature during cyclic evolutions. The tutorial delves into various topological effects arising from the Berry phase, such as the quantum, anomalous, and spin Hall effects, which exemplify how these quantum phases manifest in observable phenomena. We then extend our discussion to cover the transport properties of topological insulators, elucidating their unique behaviour rooted in Berry phase physics. This tutorial aims at equipping its readers with a robust understanding of the basic theory around the Berry phase and its pivotal role in the realm of topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Non-quasiconvex dispersion of composite fermions and the fermionic Haffnian state in the first-excited Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been puzzling that fractional quantum Hall states in the first excited Landau level (1LL) often differ significantly from their counterparts in the lowest Landau level. We show that the dispersion of composite fermions (CFs) is a deterministic factor driving the distinction. We find that CFs with two quantized vortices in the 1LL have a non-quasiconvex dispersion. Consequently, in the filling fraction $7/3$, CFs occupy the second $\Lambda$-level instead of the first. The corresponding ground state wave function, based on the CF wave function ansatz, is identified to be the fermionic Haffnian wave function rather than the Laughlin wave function. The conclusion is supported by numerical evidence from exact diagonalizations in both disk and spherical geometries. Furthermore, we show that the dispersion becomes quasiconvex in wide quantum wells or for CFs with four quantized vortices in the filling fraction $11/5$, coinciding with observations that the distinction between the Landau levels disappears under these circumstances.</description>

      <title>Imaging Coulomb interactions and migrating Dirac cones in twisted graphene by local quantum oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat band moir\'e graphene systems have emerged as a quintessential platform to investigate correlated phases of matter. A plethora of interaction-driven ground states have been proposed, and yet despite extensive experimental effort, there has been little direct evidence that distinguishes between the various phases, in particular near charge neutrality point. Here, we use a nanoscale scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image the local thermodynamic quantum oscillations in alternating-twist trilayer graphene at magnetic fields as low as 56 mT, which reveal ultrafine details of the density of states and of the renormalization of the single-particle band structure by Coulomb interactions. We find that the charging self-energy due to occupied electronic states, is critical in explaining the high carrier density physics. At half-filling of the conduction flat band, we observe a Stoner-like symmetry breaking, suggesting that it is the most robust mechanism in the hierarchy of phase transitions. On approaching charge neutrality, where the charging energy is negligible and exchange energy is dominant, we find the ground state to be a nematic semimetal which is favored over gapped states in the presence of heterostrain. In the revealed semimetallic phase, the flat-band Dirac cones migrate towards the mini-Brillouin zone center, spontaneously breaking the C_3 rotational symmetry. Our low-field local quantum oscillations technique presents an alluring avenue to explore the ground states of diverse strongly interacting van der Waals systems.</description>

      <title>Interlayer and moir\'e excitons in atomically thin double layers: from individual quantum emitters to degenerate ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer excitons (IXs), composed of electron and hole states localized in different layers, excel in bilayers composed of atomically thin van der Waals materials such as semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) due to drastically enlarged exciton binding energies, exciting spin-valley properties, elongated lifetimes, and large permanent dipoles. The latter allows modification by electric fields and the study of thermalized bosonic quasiparticles, from the single particle level to interacting degenerate dense ensembles. Additionally, the freedom to combine bilayers of different van der Waals materials without lattice or relative twist angle constraints leads to layer hybridized and moir\'e excitons which can be widely engineered. This review covers fundamental aspects of IXs including correlation phenomena as well as the consequence of moir\'e superlattices with a strong focus on TMD homo- and hetero-bilayers.</description>

      <title>Effect of order of transfer matrix exceptional points on transport at band edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that, in one dimensional fermionic systems, close to band edges, the zero temperature conductance scales as $1/N^2$, where $N$ is the system length. This universal subdiffusive scaling of conductance at band edges has been tied to an exceptional point (EP) of the transfer matrix of the system that occur at every band edge. Further, in presence of bulk dephasing probes, this EP has been shown to lead to a counterintuitive superballistic scaling of conductance, where the conductance increases with $N$ over a finite but large regime of system lengths. In this work, we explore how these behaviors are affected by the order of the transfer matrix EP at the band edge. We consider a one-dimensional fermionic lattice chain with a finite range of hopping. Depending on the range of hopping and the hopping parameters, this system can feature band edges which correspond to arbitrarily higher order EPs of the associated transfer matrix. Using this system we establish in generality that, in absence of bulk dephasing, surprisingly, the universal $1/N^2$ scaling of conductance is completely unaffected by the order of the EP. This is despite the fact that existence of transfer matrix EP is crucial for such behavior. In presence of bulk dephasing, however, the phase coherence length, the extent of the superballisitic scaling regime and the exponent of superballistic scaling, all encode the order of the transfer matrix EP.</description>

      <title>The Drude weight of a flatband metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials with seemingly contradictory properties that challenge our understanding of their transport phenomenology. On the one hand, the large density of states at the chemical potential suggests a metallic behavior. On the other hand, all states have a vanishing velocity that essentially prevents transport. Furthermore, electronic correlation effects are intrinsically strong as the interaction energy scale naturally exceeds the narrow or vanishing bandwidth. In this work, we determine the conductivity of flatband systems by investigating their Drude weight, thereby avoiding issues associated with a particular choice of relaxation broadening. Our study is a controlled analytic treatment performed at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap, a new distinctive transport regime for flat bands. We find that the Drude weight has geometric contributions that are unique to a perfectly flat band and are beyond the commonly studied quantum metric and Berry curvature. We expect that these novel contributions are essential in determining flatband response functions and shed new light on the stability of flatband systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices present a unique opportunity to venture beyond the conventional paradigm of crystalline many-body physics and explore correlated phenomena in negatively curved space. As a theoretical benchmark for such investigations, we extend Kitaev's spin-1/2 honeycomb model to hyperbolic lattices and exploit their non-Euclidean space-group symmetries to solve the model exactly. We elucidate the ground-state phase diagram on the $\{8,3\}$ lattice and find a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with Abelian anyons, a gapped chiral spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and chiral edge states, and a compressible spin liquid with low-energy density of states dominated by non-Abelian Bloch states of Majorana fermions.</description>

      <title>A foundational framework for the mesoscale modeling of dynamic elastomers and gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete mesoscale network models, in which explicitly modeled polymer chains are replaced by implicit pairwise potentials, are capable of predicting the macroscale mechanical response of polymeric materials such as elastomers and gels, while offering greater insight into microstructural phenomena than constitutive theory or macroscale experiments alone. However, whether such mesoscale models accurately represent the molecular structures of polymer networks requires investigation during their development, particularly in the case of dynamic polymers that restructure in time. We here introduce and compare the topological and mechanical predictions of an idealized, reduced-order mesoscale approach in which only tethered dynamic bonding sites and crosslinks in a polymer's backbone are explicitly modeled, to those of molecular theory and a Kremer-Grest, coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach. We find that for short chain networks at intermediate polymer packing fractions, undergoing relatively slow loading rates, the mesoscale approach reasonably reproduces the chain conformations, bond kinetic rates, and ensemble stress responses predicted by molecular theory and the bead-spring model. Further, it does so with a 90% reduction in computational cost. These savings grant the mesoscale model access to larger spatiotemporal domains than conventional molecular dynamics, enabling simulation of large deformations as well as durations approaching experimental timescales (e.g., those utilized in DMA). While the model investigated is for monodisperse polymer networks in theta-solvent, without entanglement, charge interactions, long-range dynamic bond interactions, or other confounding physical effects, this work highlights the utility of these models and lays a foundational groundwork for the incorporation of such phenomena moving forward.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric AlBN Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the properties of molecular beam epitaxy deposited AlBN thin films on a recently developed epitaxial nitride metal electrode Nb2N. While a control AlN thin film exhibits standard capacitive behavior, distinct ferroelectric switching is observed in the AlBN films with increasing Boron mole fraction. The measured remnant polarization Pr of 15 uC/cm2 and coercive field Ec of 1.45 MV/cm in these films are smaller than those recently reported on films deposited by sputtering, due to incomplete wake-up, limited by current leakage. Because AlBN preserves the ultrawide energy bandgap of AlN compared to other nitride hi-K dielectrics and ferroelectrics, and it can be epitaxially integrated with GaN and AlN semiconductors, its development will enable several opportunities for unique electronic, photonic, and memory devices.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss the emergence of fractional Shapiro steps in a Josephson junction created by confining a two-dimensional electron gas at an oxide interface. This phenomenon is induced by an alternating current of proper amplitude and frequency and can be tuned by a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Rashba spin-orbit axis. The presence of fractional Shapiro steps can be associated with the creation of Majorana bound states at the boundaries of the superconducting leads. Our findings represent a route for the identification of topological superconductivity in non-centrosymmetric materials and confined systems in the presence of spin--orbit interaction, offering also new insights into recently explored frameworks.</description>

      <title>AtomAgents: Alloy design and discovery through physics-aware multi-modal multi-agent artificial intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of alloys is a multi-scale problem that requires a holistic approach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced computational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the results, a process that is typically reserved for human experts. Machine learning (ML) can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative AI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models (LLM) the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various domains, including knowledge retrieval, multi-modal data integration, physics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities that includes numerical data and images of physical simulation results. The concerted effort of the multi-agent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key characteristics across alloys and highlight the crucial role of solid solution alloying to steer the development of advanced metallic alloys. Our framework enhances the efficiency of complex multi-objective design tasks and opens new avenues in fields such as biomedical materials engineering, renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.</description>

      <title>Achieving Peta-Ohm Resistance for Semi-Insulating 4H-SiC Devices by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing demands for precise current measurements, such as atto-ampere-level measurement of cross-cellular biological current transduction, have spotlighted a pressing need for low-noise resistors with ultra-high resistance immune to voltage fluctuations. Traditional semi-insulating materials, however, struggle to provide consistent resistance across varying voltages. To bridge this gap, we introduce a design that integrates semi-insulating 4H-SiC with atomic-level metal oxide interlayers and electrodes. The strategic adjustment of surface states via atomic-scale metal oxide layers optimizes the work functions on 4H-SiC surfaces, validated through density functional theory simulations. This design transcends conventional limitations, establishing an ideal Ohmic behavior and maintains Peta-Ohm-level resistance, unaffected by voltage variations. These on-chip devices with fine-tuned resistance are compatible with integrated circuit manufacturing processes, making them ideally suited for applications in precision electronics.</description>

      <title>The geometry of the Hermitian matrix space and the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the Schrieffer--Wolff (SW) transformation (also called quasi-degenerate perturbation theory) is known as an approximative method to reduce the dimension of the Hamiltonian. We present a geometric interpretation of the SW transformation: We prove that it induces a local coordinate chart in the space of Hermitian matrices near a $k$-fold degeneracy submanifold. Inspired by this result, we establish a `distance theorem': we show that the standard deviation of $k$ neighboring eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian equals the distance of this Hamiltonian from the corresponding $k$-fold degeneracy submanifold, divided by $\sqrt{k}$. Furthermore, we investigate one-parameter perturbations of a degenerate Hamiltonian, and prove that the standard deviation and the pairwise differences of the eigenvalues lead to the same order of splitting of the energy eigenvalues, which in turn is the same as the order of distancing from the degeneracy submanifold. As applications, we prove the `protection' of Weyl points using the transversality theorem, and infer geometrical properties of certain degeneracy submanifolds based on results from quantum error correction and topological order.</description>

      <title>Coherence of a non-equilibrium polariton condensate across the interaction-mediated phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of spatial coherence in a confined two-dimensional Bose gas of exciton-polaritons with tuneable interactions offers a unique opportunity to explore the role of interactions in a phase transition in a driven-dissipative quantum system, where both the phase transition and thermalisation are mediated by interactions. We investigate, experimentally and numerically, the phase correlations and steady-state properties of the gas over a wide range of interaction strengths by varying the photonic/excitonic fraction of the polaritons and their density. We find that the first order spatial coherence function exhibits algebraic decay consistent with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition. Surprisingly, the exponent of the algebraic decay is inversely proportional to the coherent density of polaritons, in analogy to equilibrium superfluids above the BKT transition, but with a different proportionality constant. Our work paves the way for future investigations of the phenomenon of phase transitions and superfluidity in a driven-dissipative setting</description>

Abstract: The demand for advanced photonics technology is increasing rapidly, fueled by the necessity for high-performance and cost-effective optical information processing systems extending into the quantum domain. Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. To overcome this drawback, the integration of III-V materials has proven essential. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond. Here, we present the monolithic integration of small-volume III-V nano-heterostructures with silicon via selective area epitaxy in the pyramidal openings etched in (100)-oriented silicon substrate. The precise positioning of the nano-heterostructures is achieved using electron beam lithography. Our atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis confirm the epitaxial nature of InP growth, revealing well-defined heterointerfaces. Each structure incorporates an InAsP quantum dot-like active medium. Optical characterization and eight-band kp calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. The heterostructures can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range. Consequently, these InAsP/InP nano-heterostructures could serve as a gain medium for silicon-based hybrid nano-lases and nanoLED as well as quantum light sources in the telecom wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the polarization responses in insulators in relation to the quadrupole moment. The quadrupole moment is defined as the response of the free energy to the gradient of the electric field, and its spatial variation results in the polarization, similar to the relation between the Hall current and the orbital magnetization. We show that a temperature gradient can induce polarization, known as the thermopolarization effect and that the polarization responses in insulators to the electric field and the temperature gradient satisfy the Mott relation. These effects are observable as the Seebeck effect in a finite-size system where the linear size is shorter than the screening length.</description>

      <title>Computational Investigation of the Magnetization Reversal and Magnetoresistive Behaviour of Nanoscale Spin Valve Elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigation of the magnetic switching and magnetoresistive behaviour of nanoscale spin valve elements (SVs) of varying physical parameters such as shape, element size, dimensional aspect ratio, and array size is of vital importance for their application in future magnetic memory and storage devices. We have inspected the magnetic switching mechanism and magnetoresistive behaviour of nanoscale SV elements (Co/Cu/Ni80Fe20) and arrays of these elements, with each layer having a thickness of 10 nm and rectangular and elliptical shapes with varying lateral aspect ratios (ARs) and varying interelement spacing for the arrays, by finite difference method-based micromagnetic simulation. We observe that the elements with higher AR show the Ni80Fe20 and Co layers forming antiparallel states in the plateau, similar to synthetic antiferromagnets. For lower AR, more complex quasi-uniform magnetic microstates are observed, which are even more intricate for elliptical elements. The elliptical elements with an AR of 1.25 show coherent and predictable magnetic switching behaviour, demonstrating their appropriateness for integration into magnetic memory devices. We observe a gradual increase in magnetoresistance (MR%) with the increase in AR and the decrease in interelement spacing. The magnetic flux density experiences a reduction with an increase in the inter-elemental spacing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the notion of topologically protected semi-metallic band crossings to hyperbolic lattices in a negatively curved plane. Because of their distinct translation group structure, such lattices are associated with a high-dimensional reciprocal space. In addition, they support non-Abelian Bloch states which, unlike conventional Bloch states, acquire a matrix-valued Bloch factor under lattice translations. Combining diverse numerical and analytical approaches, we uncover an unconventional scaling in the density of states at low energies, and illuminate a nodal manifold of codimension five in the reciprocal space. The nodal manifold is topologically protected by a nonzero second Chern number, reminiscent of the characterization of Weyl nodes by the first Chern number.</description>

      <title>Spectral-isolated photonic topological corner mode with a tunable mode area and stable frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergent collective modes in lattices give birth to many intriguing physical phenomena in condensed matter physics. Among these collective modes, large-area modes typically feature small-level spacings, while a mode with stable frequency tends to be spatially tightly confined. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a spectral-isolated photonic topological corner mode with a tunable mode area and stable frequency in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. This mode emerges from hybridizing the large-area homogeneous mode and in-gap topological corner modes. Remarkably, this large-area homogeneous mode possesses unique chirality and has a tunable mode area under the change of the mass term of the inner topological non-trivial lattice. We experimentally observe such topological large-area corner modes(TLCM) in a 2D photonic system and demonstrate the robustness by introducing disorders in the structure. Our findings have propelled the forefront of higher-order topology research, transitioning it from single-lattice systems to multi-lattice systems. They may support promising potential applications, particularly in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study hydrodynamic thermal transport in high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems placed in an in-plane magnetic field, and identify a new mechanism of thermal magnetotransport. This mechanism is caused by drag between the electron populations with opposite spin polarization, which arises in the presence of a hydrodynamic flow of heat. In high mobility systems, spin drag results in strong thermal magnetoresistance, which becomes of the order of 100% at relatively small spin polarization of the electron liquid. We express the thermal magnetoresistance in terms of intrinsic dissipative coefficients of electron fluid and show that it is primarily determined by the spin diffusion constant.</description>

      <title>Giant resonant skew scattering of plasma waves in graphene off a micromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron skew scattering by impurities is one of the major mechanisms behind the anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic nanostructures. It is particularly strong at the surface of topological insulators where electron dynamics is governed by the spin-1/2 Dirac equation. Motivated by recently discovered mappings between hydrodynamics and the spin-1 Dirac equation, we consider the scattering of plasma waves -- propagating charge density oscillations -- excited in graphene off a non-uniform magnetic field created by an adjacent circular micromagnet. The calculated scattering amplitude not only exhibits a giant asymmetry, or skewness, but is resonantly enhanced if the frequency of the incoming wave matches the frequency of the chiral trapped mode circulating the micromagnet in only one direction. Furthermore, if the frequency of the incoming plasma wave is a few times larger than the Larmor frequency, the angular distribution of its forward scattering is almost indistinguishable from that of a Dirac electron at the surface of a topological insulator scattering off a magnetic impurity. The micrometer scale of the proposed setup enables direct investigations of individual skew scattering events previously inaccessible in electronic systems.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation in graphene under the application of a DC electric current: From perturbative to nonperturbative regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate high-harmonic generation (HHG) in honeycomb-lattice graphene models when subjected to a DC electric field. By integrating the quantum master equation with the Boltzmann equation, we develop a numerical method to compute laser-driven dynamics in many-electron lattice systems under DC electric current. The method enables us to treat both the weak-laser (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) regimes in a unified way, accounting for the experimentally inevitable dissipation effects. From it, we obtain the HHG spectra and analyze their dependence on laser frequency, laser intensity, laser-field direction, and DC current strength. We show that the dynamical and static symmetries are partially broken by a DC current or staggered potential term, and such symmetry breakings drastically change the shape of the HHG spectra, especially in terms of the presence or absence of $(2n+1)$th-, $2n$th-, or $3n$th-order harmonics ($n\in \mathbb Z$). The laser intensity, frequency, and polarization are also shown to affect the shape of the HHG spectra. Our findings indicate that HHG spectra in conducting electron systems can be quantitatively or qualitatively controlled by tuning various external parameters, and DC electric current is used as such an efficient parameter.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions of Interacting Fermions in the Presence of a Commensurate Magnetic Flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recently reported magnetic-field induced topological phases in ultracold atoms and correlated Moir\'e materials, we investigate topological phase transitions in a minimal model consisting of interacting spinless fermions described by the Hofstadter model on a square lattice. For interacting lattice Hamiltonians in the presence of a commensurate magnetic flux it has been demonstrated that the quantized Hall conductivity is constrained by a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM)-type theorem due to magnetic translation symmetry. In this work, we revisit the validity of the theorem for such models and establish that a topological phase transition from a topological to a trivial insulating phase can be realized but must be accompanied by spontaneous magnetic translation symmetry breaking caused by charge ordering of the spinless fermions. To support our findings, the topological phase diagram for varying interaction strength is mapped out numerically with exact diagonalization for different flux quantum ratios and band fillings using symmetry indicators. We discuss our results in the context of the LSM-type theorem.</description>

      <title>Theory of the inverse Faraday effect in dissipative Rashba electron systems: Floquet engineering perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), i.e., photo-induced magnetization, in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled electron systems irradiated by a circularly polarized light. The quantum master (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation enables us to accurately compute the laser driven dynamics, taking inevitable dissipation effects into account. To find the universal features of laser-driven magnetization and its dynamics, we comprehensively investigate (i) the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) driven by a continuous wave and (ii) ultrafast spin dynamics driven by short laser pulses. In the NESS (i), the laser-induced magnetization and its dependence of several parameters (laser frequency, laser field strength, temperature, dissipation strength, etc.) are shown to be in good agreement with the predictions from Floquet theory for dissipative systems in the high-frequency regime. In the case (ii), we focus on ferromagnetic metal states by introducing an effective magnetic field to the Rashba model as the mean field of electron-electron interaction. We find that a precession of the magnetic moment occurs due to the pulse-driven instantaneous magnetic field and the initial phase of the precession is controlled by changing the sign of light polarization. This is well consistent with the spin dynamics observed in experiments of laser-pulse-driven IFE. We discuss how the pulse-driven dynamics are captured by the Floquet theory. Our results %pave the way for computing provides a microscopic method to compute ultrafast dynamics in many electron systems irradiated by intense light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study superfluidlike spin transport facilitated by thermal diffusion of magnetic domain walls, where the positive and negative chiralities of domain walls act as opposite topological charges. The topological charge conservation leads to algebraic decay of spin current carried by domain walls, allowing for the transport of spin over extended distances. We demonstrate that the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can lead to nonreciprocity in spin flow, thus effectively realizing a spin ratchet. In one scenario, the nonreciprocity arises due to diode-like behavior where the nucleation of domain walls is governed by thermal activation for one direction of spin current and by viscous injection for the other direction of spin current. We confirm our predictions by micromagnetic simulations of domain walls in TmIG nanowire.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A current flowing through a superconductor induces a spatial modulation in its superconducting order parameter, characterized by a wavevector $Q$ related to the total momentum of a Cooper pair. Here we investigate this phenomenon in a $p$-wave topological superconductor, described by a one-dimensional Kitaev model. We demonstrate that, by treating $Q$ as an extra synthetic dimension, the current carrying non-equilibrium steady state can be mapped into the ground state of a half-filled two-dimensional Weyl semimetal, whose Fermi surface exhibits Lifshitz transitions when varying the model parameters. Specifically, the transition from Type-I to Type-II Weyl phases corresponds to the emergence of a gapless $p$-wave superconductor, where Cooper pairs coexist with unpaired electrons and holes. Such transition is signaled by the appearance of a sharp cusp in the $Q$-dependence of the supercurrent, at a critical value $Q^*$ that is robust to variations of the chemical potential $\mu$. We determine the maximal current that the system can sustain in the topological phase, and discuss possible implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a thermodynamically consistent, mesoscopic model for modern complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors, we study an array of logical circuits and explore how their function is constrained by recent thermodynamic uncertainty relations when operating near thermal energies. For a single NOT gate, we find operating direction-dependent dynamics, and a trade-off between dissipated heat and operation time certainty. For a memory storage device, we find an exponential relationship between the memory retention time and energy required to sustain that memory state. For a clock, we find that the certainty in the cycle time is maximized at biasing voltages near thermal energy, as is the trade-off between this certainty and the heat dissipated per cycle. We identify a control mechanism that can increase the cycle time certainty without an offsetting increase in heat dissipation by working at a resonance condition for the clock. These results provide a framework for assessing thermodynamic costs of realistic computing devices, allowing for circuits to be designed and controlled for thermodynamically optimal operation.</description>

      <title>Cephalo: Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models for Bio-Inspired Materials Analysis and Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Cephalo, a series of multimodal vision large language models (V-LLMs) designed for materials science applications, integrating visual and linguistic data for enhanced understanding. A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data from thousands of scientific papers and science-focused Wikipedia data demonstrates can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports multimodal natural language understanding, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To develop more capable models from smaller ones, we report both mixture-of-expert methods and model merging. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio-inspired designs, including pollen-inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio-inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse. Additional model fine-tuning with a series of molecular dynamics results demonstrate Cephalo's enhanced capabilities to accurately predict statistical features of stress and atomic energy distributions, as well as crack dynamics and damage in materials.</description>
