      <title>Machine Learning of Nonlinear Waves: Data-Driven Methods for Computer-Assisted Discovery of Equations, Symmetries, Conservation Laws, and Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to provide a perspective - admittedly, a rather subjective one - of recent developments at the interface of machine learning/data-driven methods and nonlinear wave studies. We review some recent pillars of the rapidly evolving landscape of scientific machine learning, including deep learning, data-driven equation discovery, and operator learning, among others. We then showcase these methods in applications ranging from learning lattice dynamical models and reduced order modeling of effective dynamics to discovery of conservation laws and potential identification of integrability of ODE and PDE models. Our intention is to make clear that these machine learning methods are complementary to the preexisting powerful tools of the nonlinear waves community, and should be integrated into this toolkit to augment and enable mathematical discoveries and computational capabilities in the age of data.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of nonlinearly coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators play a central role in the study of synchronization phenomena. Previous works have focused on linearly coupled oscillators in different configurations, such as all-to-all or generic complex networks, allowing for both reciprocal or non-reciprocal links. The emergence of synchronization can be deduced by proving the linear stability of the limit cycle solution for the Stuart-Landau model; the linear coupling assumption allows for a complete analytical treatment of the problem, mostly because the linearized system turns out to be autonomous. In this work, we analyze Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled through nonlinear functions on both undirected and directed networks; synchronization now depends on the study of a non-autonomous linear system and thus novel tools are required to tackle the problem. We provide a complete analytical description of the system for some choices of the nonlinear coupling, e.g., in the resonant case. Otherwise, we develop a semi-analytical framework based on Jacobi-Anger expansion and Floquet theory, which allows us to derive precise conditions for the emergence of complete synchronization. The obtained results extend the classical theory of coupled oscillators and pave the way for future studies of nonlinear interactions in networks of oscillators and beyond.</description>

      <title>Amplitude equations of associative memory patterns in spatially distributed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolution equations are derived for the amplitudes of associative memories: heterogeneous states stored in the connectivity of distributed systems with non-local interactions. The resulting coupled amplitude equations describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of memory recall. They capture pattern completion and selection, and show that short-range connections can sustain spatio-temporal memory pattern dynamics in the form of propagating patterning fronts. The derived amplitude equations are of the same form as those describing classical pattern-forming instabilities, indicating a universality of the dynamics of memory recall and pattern formation in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Hawking time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a time crystal based on a quantum black-hole laser, where the genuinely spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time observables are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic analogue of the Andreev-Hawking effect, exhibiting anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions. Remarkably, the time-crystal formation is understood in terms of two time operators: one associated to the initial black-hole laser and another associated to the final spontaneous Floquet state.</description>
