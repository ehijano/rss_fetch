      <title>Algorithm for Interpretable Graph Features via Motivic Persistent Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Chromatic Persistence Algorithm (CPA), an event-driven method for computing persistent cohomological features of weighted graphs via graphic arrangements, a classical object in computational geometry. We establish rigorous complexity results: CPA is exponential in the worst case, fixed-parameter tractable in treewidth, and nearly linear for common graph families such as trees, cycles, and series-parallel graphs. Finally, we demonstrate its practical applicability through a controlled experiment on molecular-like graph structures.</description>

      <title>Top-K Exterior Power Persistent Homology: Algorithm, Structure, and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exterior powers play important roles in persistent homology in computational geometry. In the present paper we study the problem of extracting the $K$ longest intervals of the exterior-power layers of a tame persistence module. We prove a structural decomposition theorem that organizes the exterior-power layers into monotone per-anchor streams with explicit multiplicities, enabling a best-first algorithm. We also show that the Top-$K$ length vector is $2$-Lipschitz under bottleneck perturbations of the input barcode, and prove a comparison-model lower bound. Our experiments confirm the theory, showing speedups over full enumeration in high overlap cases. By enabling efficient extraction of the most prominent features, our approach makes higher-order persistence feasible for large datasets and thus broadly applicable to machine learning, data science, and scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gates from Wolfram Model Multiway Rewriting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how representations of finite-dimensional quantum operators can be constructed using nondeterministic rewriting systems. In particular, we investigate Wolfram model multiway rewriting systems based on string substitutions. Multiway systems were proposed by S. Wolfram as generic model systems for multicomputational processes, emphasizing their significance as a foundation for modeling complexity, nondeterminism, and branching structures of measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings with a neighborhood constraint - the latter called Leibnizian strings. We show that such strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values of occupation numbers of character neighborhoods. A Leibnizian string serves as an abstraction of a $N$-fermion system. A multiway system of these strings encodes causal relations between rewriting events in a nondeterministic manner. The collection of character strings realizes a $\mathbb{Z}$-module with a symmetric $\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form. For discrete spaces, this generalizes the notion of an inner product over a vector field. This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $\pi/8$, and Hadamard gates. Hence, using multiway systems one can represent quantum circuits for qubits.</description>

      <title>Boundedness for proper conflict-free and odd colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00170v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proper conflict-free chromatic number, $\chi_{pcf}(G)$, of a graph $G$ is the least $k$ such that $G$ has a proper $k$-coloring in which for each non-isolated vertex there is a color appearing exactly once among its neighbors. The proper odd chromatic number, $\chi_{o}(G)$, of $G$ is the least $k$ such that $G$ has a proper coloring in which for every non-isolated vertex there is a color appearing an odd number of times among its neighbors. We say that a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded ($\chi_{o}$-bounded) if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi_{pcf}(G) \leq f(\chi(G))$ ($\chi_{o}(G) \leq f(\chi(G))$) for every $G \in \mathcal{G}$. Caro et al. (2022) asked for classes that are linearly $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded ($\chi_{pcf}$-bounded), and as a starting point, they showed that every claw-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le 2\Delta(G)+1$, which implies $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le 4\chi(G)+1$.
  In this paper, we improve the bound for claw-free graphs to a nearly tight bound by showing that such a graph $G$ satisfies $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le \Delta(G)+6$, and even $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le \Delta(G)+4$ if it is a quasi-line graph. These results also give evidence for a conjecture by Caro et al. Moreover, we show that convex-round graphs and permutation graphs are linearly $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded. For these last two results, we prove a lemma that reduces the problem of deciding if a hereditary class is linearly $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded to deciding if the bipartite graphs in the class are $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded by an absolute constant. This lemma complements a theorem of Liu (2022) and motivates us to study boundedness in bipartite graphs. In particular, we show that biconvex bipartite graphs are $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded while convex bipartite graphs are not even $\chi_o$-bounded, and exhibit a class of bipartite circle graphs that is linearly $\chi_o$-bounded but not $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded.</description>
