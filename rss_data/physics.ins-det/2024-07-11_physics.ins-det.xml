      <title>Deep(er) Reconstruction of Imaging Cherenkov Detectors with Swin Transformers and Normalizing Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging Cherenkov detectors are crucial for particle identification (PID) in nuclear and particle physics experiments. Fast reconstruction algorithms are essential for near real-time alignment, calibration, data quality control, and efficient analysis. At the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), the ePIC detector will feature a dual Ring Imaging Cherenkov (dual-RICH) detector in the hadron direction, a Detector of Internally Reflected Cherenkov (DIRC) in the barrel, and a proximity focus RICH in the electron direction. This paper focuses on the DIRC detector, which presents complex hit patterns and is also used for PID of pions and kaons in the GlueX experiment at JLab. We present Deep(er)RICH, an extension of the seminal DeepRICH work, offering improved and faster PID compared to traditional methods and, for the first time, fast and accurate simulation. This advancement addresses a major bottleneck in Cherenkov detector simulations involving photon tracking through complex optical elements. Our results leverage advancements in Vision Transformers, specifically hierarchical Swin Transformer and normalizing flows. These methods enable direct learning from real data and the reconstruction of complex topologies. We conclude by discussing the implications and future extensions of this work, which can offer capabilities for PID for multiple cutting-edge experiments like the future EIC.</description>

      <title>Characterization of SiPM Performance in a Small Satellite in Low Earth Orbit using LabOSat-01</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the performance of SensL MicroFC-60035 SiPM devices was studied during a 1460-day mission in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using the LabOSat-01 characterization payload. Two of these platforms, carrying two SiPMs each, were integrated into the \~NuSat-7 satellite (COSPAR-ID: 2020-003B). Analysis revealed that these SiPMs experienced an increase in dark current over time due to damage from trapped and solar proton radiation. The total ionizing dose received by the payload and the SiPMs was measured using p-MOSFET dosimeters, with a resulting value of 5 Gy, or a 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence of $\phi_n = 5 \cdot 10^9$ n/cm$^2$. The dark current was observed to increase up to 500 times. Parameters such as Gain and Photon Detection Efficiency remained unchanged throughout the mission. These findings align with previous performance reports involving different SiPMs irradiated with various particles and energies.</description>

      <title>Timing resolution performance of Timepix4 bump-bonded assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The timing performance of the Timepix4 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bump-bonded to a $100\;\mu\textrm{m}$ thick n-on-p silicon sensor is presented. A picosecond pulsed infrared laser was used to generate electron-hole pairs in the silicon bulk in a repeatable fashion, controlling the amount, position and time of the stimulated charge signal. The timing resolution for a single pixel has been measured to $107\;\textrm{ps}$ r.m.s. for laser-stimulated signals in the silicon sensor bulk. Considering multi-pixel clusters, the measured timing resolution reached $33\;\textrm{ps}$ r.m.s. exploiting oversampling of the timing information over several pixels.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Novel Indium Phosphide Pad Detectors with Focused X-ray Beams and Laboratory Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future tracking systems in High Energy Physics experiments will require large instrumented areas with low radiation length. Crystalline silicon sensors have been used in tracking systems for decades, but are difficult to manufacture and costly to produce for large areas. We are exploring alternative sensor materials that are amenable to fast fabrication techniques used for thin film devices. Indium Phosphide pad sensors were fabricated at Argonne National Lab using commercially available InP:Fe 2-inch mono-crystal substrates. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characterizations were performed to study the basic operating characteristics of a group of sensors. Micro-focused X-ray beams at Canadian Light Source and Diamond Light Source were used to study the response to ionizing radiation, and characterize the uniformity of the response for several devices. The results show a high degree of performance uniformity in our evaluations, both within a device and between the 48 tested devices. This motivates further studies into thin film devices for future tracking detectors.</description>
