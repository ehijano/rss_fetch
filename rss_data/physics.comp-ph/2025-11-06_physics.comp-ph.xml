      <title>Modal Backflow Neural Quantum States for Anharmonic Vibrational Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are a promising ansatz for solving many-body quantum problems due to their inherent expressiveness. Yet, this expressiveness can only be harnessed efficiently for treating identical particles if the suitable physical knowledge is hardwired into the neural network itself. For electronic structure, NQS based on backflow determinants has been shown to be a powerful ansatz for capturing strong correlation. By contrast, the analogue for bosons, backflow permanents, is unpractical due to the steep cost of computing the matrix permanent and due to the lack of particle conservation in common bosonic problems. To circumvent these obstacles, we introduce a modal backflow (MBF) NQS design and demonstrate its efficacy by solving the anharmonic vibrational problem. To accommodate the demand of high accuracy in spectroscopic calculations, we implement a selected-configuration scheme for evaluating physical observables and gradients, replacing the standard stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo sampling. A vibrational self-consistent field calculation is conveniently carried out within the MBF network, which serves as a pretraining step to accelerate and stabilize the optimization. In applications to both artificial and ab initio Hamiltonians, we find that the MBF network is capable of delivering spectroscopically accurate zero-point energies and vibrational transitions in all anharmonic regimes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Boundary Control of Diffusion on Graphs via Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a linear programming (LP) framework for steady-state diffusion and flux optimization on geometric networks. The state variable satisfies a discrete diffusion law on a weighted, oriented graph, where conductances are scaled by edge lengths to preserve geometric fidelity. Boundary potentials act as controls that drive interior fluxes according to a linear network Laplacian. The optimization problem enforces physically meaningful sign and flux-cap constraints at all boundary edges, derived directly from a gradient bound. This yields a finite-dimensional LP whose feasible set is polyhedral, and whose boundedness and solvability follow from simple geometric or algebraic conditions on the network data.
  We prove that under the absence of negative recession directions--automatically satisfied in the presence of finite box bounds, flux caps, or sign restrictions--the LP admits a global minimizer. Several sufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the feasible region are identified, covering both full-rank and rank-deficient flux maps. The analysis connects classical results such as the Minkowski--Weyl decomposition, Hoffman's bound, and the fundamental theorem of linear programming with modern network-based diffusion modeling.
  Two large-scale examples illustrate the framework: (i) A typical large stadium in a major modern city, which forms a single connected component with relatively uniform corridor widths, and a (ii) A complex street network emanating from a large, historical city center, which forms a multi-component system.</description>

      <title>The isogeometric boundary element algorithm for solving the plane strain problem of an elastic matrix containing an open material surface of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents the Isogeometric Boundary Element Method (IGABEM) algorithm for solving the plane strain problem of an isotropic linearly elastic matrix containing an open material surface of arbitrary shape. Theoretical developments are based on the use of the Gurtin-Murdoch model of material surfaces. The governing equations and the boundary conditions for the problem are reviewed, and analytical integral representations for the elastic fields everywhere in the material system are presented in terms of unknown traction jumps across the surface. To find the jumps, the problem is reduced to a system of singular boundary integral equations in terms of two unknown scalar components of the surface stress tensor. The system is solved numerically using the developed IGABEM algorithm in which NURBS are used to approximate the unknowns. The main steps of the algorithm are discussed and convergence studies are performed. The algorithm is validated using two benchmark problems involving the matrix subjected to a uniform far-field load and containing a surface along (i) a straight segment and (ii) a circular arc. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the influence of governing parameters with a focus on the influence of curvature variation.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Simulation of 50 Qubits on Europe`s First Exascale Supercomputer Harnessing Its Heterogeneous CPU-GPU Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a new version of the high-performance J\"ulich universal quantum computer simulator (JUQCS-50) that leverages key features of the GH200 superchips as used in the JUPITER supercomputer, enabling simulations of a 50-qubit universal quantum computer for the first time. JUQCS-50 achieves this through three key innovations: (1) extending usable memory beyond GPU limits via high-bandwidth CPU-GPU interconnects and LPDDR5 memory; (2) adaptive data encoding to reduce memory footprint with acceptable trade-offs in precision and compute effort; and (3) an on-the-fly network traffic optimizer. These advances result in an 11.4-fold speedup over the previous 48-qubit record on the K computer.</description>

      <title>Enhancing composition-based materials property prediction by cross-modal knowledge transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal graph neural networks are widely applicable in modeling experimentally synthesized compounds and hypothetical materials with unknown synthesizability. In contrast, structure-agnostic predictive algorithms allow exploring previously inaccessible domains of chemical space. Here we present a universal approach for enhancing composition-based materials property prediction by means of cross-modal knowledge transfer. Two formulations are proposed: implicit transfer involves pretraining chemical language models on multimodal embeddings, whereas explicit transfer suggests generating crystal structures and implementing structure-aware predictors. The proposed approaches were benchmarked on LLM4Mat-Bench and MatBench tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 25 out of 32 cases. In addition, we demonstrated how another modeling aspect of chemical language models - interpretability - benefits from applying a game-theoretic approach, which is able to incorporate high-order feature interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum error mitigation using energy sampling and extrapolation enhanced Clifford data regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</description>

      <title>Atom-Field Non-Markovian Dynamics in Open and Dissipative Systems: An Efficient Memory-Kernel Approach Linked to Dyadic Greens Function and CEM Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical framework for modeling single photon emission from a two level system in open and dissipative systems beyond the Markovian approximation. The method can be readily integrated into standard computational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the completeness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin noise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens function through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction enables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi mode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the single excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level system is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying that radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework thus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population and single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then present concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM frameworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify numerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the case of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in a Fabry Perot cavity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for incorporating quantum emitter dynamics into computational electromagnetics, thereby extending classical solvers toward quantum light matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of the Spin-Free Renormalized Internally-Contracted Multireference Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an efficient implementation of the renormalized internally-contracted multreference coupled cluster with singles and doubles (RIC-MRCCSD) into the ORCA quantum chemistry program suite is reported. To this end, Evangelista's Wick&amp;d equation generator was combined with ORCA's native AGE code generator in order to implement the many-body residuals required for the RIC-MRCCSD method. Substantial efficiency gains are realized by deriving a spin-free formulation instead of the previously reported spin-orbital version developed by some of us. Since AGE produces parallelized code, the resulting implementation can directly be run in parallel with substantial speedups when executed on multiple cores. In terms of runtime, the cost of RIC-MRCCSD is shown to be between single-reference RHF-CCSD and UHF-CCSD, even when active space spaces as large as CAS(14,14) are considered. This achievement is largely due to the fact that no reduced density matrices (RDM) or cumulants higher than three-body enter the formalism. The scalability of the method to large systems is furthermore demonstrated by computing the ground-state of a vitamin B12 model comprised of an active space of CAS(12, 12) and 809 orbitals. In terms of accuracy, RIC-MRCCSD is carefully compared to second- and approximate fourth-order $n$-electron valence state perturbation theories (NEVPT2, NEVPT4(SD)), to the multireference zeroth-order coupled-electron pair approximation (CEPA(0)), as well as to the IC-MRCCSD from Kohn. In contrast to RIC-MRCCSD, the IC-MRCCSD equations are entirely derived by AGE using the conventional projection-based approach, which, however, leads to much higher algorithmic complexity than the former as well as the necessity to calculate up to the five-body RDMs. Remaining challenges such as the variation of the results with the flow, a free parameter that enters the RIC-MRCCSD theory, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Encoding electronic ground-state information with variational even-tempered basis sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a system-oriented basis-set design based on even-tempered basis functions to variationally encode electronic ground-state information into molecular orbitals. First, we introduce a reduced formalism of concentric even-tempered orbitals that achieves hydrogen energy accuracy on par with the conventional formalism, with lower optimization cost and improved scalability. Second, we propose a symmetry-adapted, even-tempered formalism specifically designed for molecular systems. It requires only primitive S-subshell Gaussian-type orbitals and uses two parameters to characterize all exponent coefficients. In the case of the diatomic hydrogen molecule, the basis set generated by this formalism produces a dissociation curve more consistent with cc-pV5Z than cc-pVTZ at the size of aug-cc-pVDZ. Finally, we test our even-tempered formalism against several types of tetra-atomic hydrogen molecules for ground-state computation and point out its current limitations and potential improvements.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Solar Cycle Nonlinearities into the Algebraic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting solar-cycle variability requires accounting for nonlinear feedbacks that regulate the buildup of the Sun's polar magnetic field. We present a simplified but physically grounded algebraic approach that models the dipole contribution of active regions (ARs) while incorporating two key nonlinearities: tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). Using ensembles of synthetic cycles across the dynamo effectivity range $\lambda_R$, we quantify how these mechanisms suppress the axial dipole and impose self-limiting feedback.
  Our results show that (i) both TQ and LQ reduce the polar field, and together they generate a clear saturation (ceiling) of dipole growth with increasing cycle amplitude; (ii) the balance between LQ and TQ, expressed as $R(\lambda_R) = \mathrm{dev(LQ)}/\mathrm{dev(TQ)}$, transitions near $\lambda_R \approx 12^\circ$, with LQ dominating at low $\lambda_R$ and TQ at high $\lambda_R$; (iii) over $8^\circ \leq \lambda_R \leq 20^\circ$, the ratio follows a shallow offset power law with exponent $n \approx 0.36 \pm 0.04$, significantly flatter than the $n=2$ scaling assumed in many surface flux--transport (SFT) models; and (iv) symmetric, tilt-asymmetric, and morphology-asymmetric AR prescriptions yield nearly identical $R(\lambda_R)$ curves, indicating weak sensitivity to AR geometry for fixed transport.
  These findings demonstrate that nonlinear saturation of the solar cycle can be captured efficiently with algebraic formulations, providing a transparent complement to full SFT simulations. The method highlights that the LQ\--TQ balance is primarily controlled by transport ($\lambda_R$), not by active-region configuration, and statistically disfavors the SFT-based $1/\lambda_R^{2}$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Weighted Morphological Content of Large-Scale Structures via Simulation-Based Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a simulation-based forecasting analysis to compare the constraining power of two higher-order summary statistics of the large-scale structure (LSS), the Minkowski Functionals (MFs) and the Conditional Moments of Derivative (CMD), with a particular focus on their sensitivity to nonlinear and anisotropic features in redshift-space. Our analysis relies on halo catalogs from the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ) simulations at redshift $z=0.5$, employing a likelihood-free inference framework implemented via neural posterior estimation. At the fiducial cosmology of the Quijote simulations $(\Omega_{m}=0.3175,\,\sigma_{8}=0.834)$, and for the smoothing scale $R=15\,h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that the CMD yields tighter forecasts for $(\Omega_{m}},\,\sigma_{8})$ than the zeroth- to third-order MFs components, improving the constraint precision by ${\sim}(44\%,\,52\%)$, ${\sim}(30\%,\,45\%)$, ${\sim}(27\%,\,17\%)$, and ${\sim}(26\%,\,17\%)$, respectively. A joint configuration combining the MFs and CMD further enhances the precision by approximately ${\sim}27\%$ compared to the standard MFs alone, highlighting the complementary anisotropy-sensitive information captured by the CMD in contrast to the scalar morphological content encapsulated by the MFs. We further extend the forecasting analysis to a continuous range of cosmological parameter values and multiple smoothing scales. Our results show that, although the absolute forecast uncertainty for each component of summary statistics depends on the underlying parameter values and the adopted smoothing scale, the relative constraining power among the summary statistics remains nearly constant throughout.</description>

      <title>Efficient GPU Parallelization of Electronic Transport and Nonequilibrium Dynamics from Electron-Phonon Interactions in the Perturbo Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions computed from first principles is widely used to study electronic transport and nonequilibrium dynamics in materials. Calculating the e-ph collision integral is the most important step in the BTE, but it remains computationally costly, even with current MPI+OpenMP parallelization. This challenge makes it difficult to study materials with large unit cells and to achieve high resolution in momentum space. Here, we show acceleration of BTE calculations of electronic transport and ultrafast dynamics using graphical processing units (GPUs). We implement a novel data structure and algorithm, optimized for GPU hardware and developed using OpenACC, to process scattering channels and efficiently compute the collision integral. This approach significantly reduces the overhead for data referencing, movement, and synchronization. Relative to the efficient CPU implementation in the open-source package Perturbo (v2.2.0), used as a baseline, this approach achieves a speed-up of 40 times for both transport and nonequilibrium dynamics on GPU hardware, and achieves nearly linear scaling up to 100 GPUs. The novel data structure can be generalized to other electron interactions and scattering processes. We released this GPU implementation in the latest public version (v3.0.0) of Perturbo. The new MPI+OpenMP+GPU parallelization enables sweeping studies of e-ph physics and electron dynamics in conventional and quantum materials, and prepares Perturbo for exascale supercomputing platforms.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Modal Analysis of Multimode Waveguides from Amplitudes via Large-Step Nonconvex Optimization</title>

Abstract: Optimizing multimodal waveguide performance depends on modal analysis; however, existing methods focus predominantly on modal power distribution (MPD) and, limited by experimental hardware and conditions, exhibit low accuracy, poor adaptability, and high computational cost. This work presents a novel framework for comprehensive modal analysis (recovering both power and relative phase) using aperture field (AF) and far field (FF) amplitude measurements. We formulate the modal analysis as a nonconvex optimization problem under a power-normalization constraint and, inspired by recent advances in deep learning, introduce a large-step strategy to solve it. Our method retrieves both the MPD and the modal relative-phase distribution(MRPD). The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through visualization of the nonconvex optimization process via its loss landscape. Under noiseless conditions, analysis results of $93$ electromagnetic modes indicate that the relative amplitude accuracy $\mathrm{MRE_{Modulus}}$, and the phase accuracy $\mathrm{MAE_{Phase}}$, both reach the level of machine precision. Through noise simulations of the AF and environmental background, the operational principles of the method are demonstrated under signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions ranging from $10~\mathrm{dB}$ to $60~\mathrm{dB}$. Experiments further confirm that error suppression is effectively achieved by increasing the number of sampling points, thereby maintaining high accuracy and strong robustness. Within a unified evaluation framework, the absolute amplitude error $\mathrm{MAE_{Modulus}}$, and the phase error $\mathrm{MAE_{Phase}}$, are as low as $1.633\times10^{-8}$ and $0$, respectively. The accuracy is significantly superior to existing methods, while also exhibiting higher computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems using Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of causality in dynamical systems using Koopman operators. Our theory is grounded on a rigorous definition of causal mechanism in dynamical systems given in terms of flow maps. In the Koopman framework, we prove that causal mechanisms manifest as particular flows of observables between function subspaces. While the flow map definition is a clear generalization of the standard definition of causal mechanism given in the structural causal model framework, the flow maps are complicated objects that are not tractable to work with in practice. By contrast, the equivalent Koopman definition lends itself to a straightforward data-driven algorithm that can quantify multivariate causal relations in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. The coupled Rossler system provides examples and demonstrations throughout our exposition. We also demonstrate the utility of our data-driven Koopman causality measure by identifying causal flow in the Lorenz 96 system. We show that the causal flow identified by our data-driven algorithm agrees with the information flow identified through a perturbation propagation experiment. Our work provides new theoretical insights into causality for nonlinear dynamical systems, as well as a new toolkit for data-driven causal analysis.</description>

      <title>Molecular Fluctuations Inhibit Intermittency in Compressible Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard picture of fully-developed turbulence, highly intermittent hydrodynamic fields are nonlinearly coupled across scales, where local energy cascades from large scales into dissipative vortices and large density gradients. Microscopically, however, constituent fluid molecules are in constant thermal (Brownian) motion, but the role of molecular fluctuations on large-scale turbulence is largely unknown, and with rare exceptions, it has historically been considered irrelevant at scales larger than the molecular mean free path. Recent theoretical and computational investigations have shown that molecular fluctuations can impact energy cascade at Kolmogorov length scales. Here we show that molecular fluctuations not only modify energy spectrum at wavelengths larger than the Kolmogorov length in compressible turbulence, but they also significantly inhibit spatio-temporal intermittency across the entire dissipation range. Using large-scale direct numerical simulations of computational fluctuating hydrodynamics, we demonstrate that the extreme intermittency characteristic of turbulence models is replaced by nearly-Gaussian statistics in the dissipation range. These results demonstrate that the compressible Navier-Stokes equations should be augmented with molecular fluctuations to accurately predict turbulence statistics across the dissipation range. Our findings have significant consequences for turbulence modeling in applications such as astrophysics, reactive flows, and hypersonic aerodynamics, where dissipation-range turbulence is approximated by closure models.</description>

      <title>Nonpertubative Many-Body Theory for the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model at Low Temperature: From Weak to Strong Coupling Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In theoretical studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems, the Mermin-Wagner theorem prevents continuous symmetry breaking at any finite temperature, thus forbidding a Landau phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$. The difficulty arises when many-body theoretical studies predict a Landau phase transition at finite temperatures, which contradicts the Mermin-Wagner theorem and is termed a pseudo phase transition. To tackle this problem, we systematically develop a symmetrization scheme, defined as averaging physical quantities over all symmetry-breaking states, thus ensuring that it preserves the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We apply the symmetrization scheme to the GW-covariance calculation for the 2D repulsive Hubbard model at half-filling in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime and at low temperatures, obtaining the one-body Green's function and spin-spin correlation function, and benchmark them against Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) with good agreement.The spin-spin correlation functions are approached within the covariance theory, a general method for calculating two-body correlation functions from a one-particle starting point, such as the GW formalism used here, which ensures the preservation of the fundamental fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) and Ward-Takahashi identities (WTI). With the FDR and WTI satisfied, we conjecture that the $\chi$-sum rule, a fundamental relation from the Pauli exclusion principle, can be used to probe the reliability of many-body methods, and demonstrate this by comparing the GW-covariance and mean-field-covariance approaches. This work provides a novel framework to investigate the strong-coupling and doped regime of the 2D Hubbard model, which is believed to be applicable to real high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Self-gravity in thin protoplanetary discs: 1. The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.
  To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests.
  The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.
  We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposition Networks for Fast Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as a class of approximately equivariant networks in which CG tensor products are replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space weights across the $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive performance with dramatic speedup in computations. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (\href{https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenMol/TDN}{https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/}).</description>

      <title>A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB power spectra (TT, EE, BB, TE), and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables a bidirectional mapping between the cosmological parameters and the acoustic peak features of $D_\ell^{\rm TT}$. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves sub-percent accuracy over multipoles $\ell \leq 4050$, while PolyCAMB-peak also attains comparable precision and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>Gold-Standard Chemical Database 137 (GSCDB137): A diverse set of accurate energy differences for assessing and developing density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GSCDB137, a rigorously curated benchmark library of 137 data sets (8377 entries) covering main-group and transition-metal reaction energies and barrier heights, (intramolecular) non-covalent interactions, dipole moments, polarizabilities, electric-field response energies, and vibrational frequencies. Legacy data from GMTKN55 and MGCDB84 have been updated to today's best reference values; redundant, spin-contaminated, or low-quality points were removed, and many new, property-focused sets were added. Testing 29 popular density functional approximations (DFAs) confirms the expected Jacob's-ladder hierarchy overall but also reveals notable exceptions: functional performance for frequencies and electric-field properties correlates poorly with that for other ground-state energetics. {\omega}B97M-V and {\omega}B97X-V are the most balanced hybrid meta-GGA and hybrid GGA, respectively; B97M-V and revPBE-D4 lead the meta-GGA and GGA classes. Double hybrids lower mean errors by about 25 % versus the best hybrids but demand careful frozen-core, basis-set, and multi-reference treatment. GSCDB137 offers a comprehensive, openly documented platform for stringent DFA validation and for training the next generation of non-empirical and machine-learned functionals.</description>

      <title>An efficient spectral Poisson solver for the nirvana-III code: the shearing-box case with vertical vacuum boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of a differentially rotating fluid subject to its own gravity is a problem with applications across wide areas of astrophysics--from protoplanetary discs (PPDs) to entire galaxies. The shearing box formalism offers a conceptually simple framework for studying differential rotation in the local approximation. Aimed at self-gravitating, and importantly, vertically stratified PPDs, we develop two novel methods for solving Poisson's equation in the framework of the shearing box with vertical vacuum boundary conditions (BCs). Both approaches naturally make use of multi-dimensional fast Fourier transforms for computational efficiency. While the first one exploits the linearity properties of the Poisson equation, the second, which is slightly more accurate, consists of finding the adequate discrete Green's function (in Fourier space) adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, we have revisited the method proposed by Vico et al. (2016) and have derived an analytical Green's function satisfying the shear-periodic BCs in the plane as well as vacuum BCs, vertically. Our spectral method demonstrates excellent accuracy, even with a modest number of grid points, and exhibits third-order convergence. It has been implemented in the NIRVANA-III code, where it exhibits good scalability up to 4096 CPU cores, consuming less than 6% of the total runtime. This was achieved through the use of P3DFFT, a fast Fourier Transform library that employs pencil decomposition, overcoming the scalability limitations inherent in libraries using slab decomposition. We have introduced two novel spectral Poisson solvers that guarantees high accuracy, performance, and intrinsically support vertical vacuum boundary conditions in the shearing-box framework. Our solvers enable high-resolution local studies involving self-gravity, such as MHD simulations of gravito-turbulence or gravitational fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Approximation of Weak Solutions to Time Dependent Maxwell's Equations with $L^2$-Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Maxwell's equations in conducting media with perfectly conducting boundary conditions on Lipschitz domains, allowing rough material coefficients and $L^2$-data. Our first contribution is a direct proof of well-posedness of the first-order weak formulation, including solution existence and uniqueness, an energy identity, and continuous dependence on the data. The argument uses interior-in-time mollification to show uniqueness while avoiding reflection techniques. Existence is via the well-known Galerkin method (cf.~Duvaut and Lions \cite[Eqns.~(4.31)--(4.32), p.~346; Thm.~4.1]{GDuvaut_JLLions_1976a}). For completeness, and to make the paper self-contained, a complete proof has been provided.
  Our second contribution is a structure-preserving semi-discrete finite element method based on the N\'ed\'elec/Raviart--Thomas de Rham complex. The scheme preserves a discrete Gauss law for all times and satisfies a continuous-in-time energy identity with stability for nonnegative conductivity. With a divergence-free initialization of the magnetic field (via potential reconstruction or constrained $L^2$ projection), we prove convergence of the semi-discrete solutions to the unique weak solution as the mesh is refined. The analysis mostly relies on projector consistency, weak-* compactness in time-bounded $L^2$ spaces, and identification of time derivatives in dual spaces.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast magnetic moment transfer and bandgap renormalization in monolayer FeCl$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic FeCl$_2$ monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials.</description>
