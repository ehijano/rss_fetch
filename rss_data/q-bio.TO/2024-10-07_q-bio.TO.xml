      <title>Longitudinal photoacoustic monitoring of collagen evolution modulated by cancer-associated fibroblasts: simulation and experiment studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noninvasive in vivo detection of collagen facilitates the investigation of mechanisms by which cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) regulates the extracellular matrix. This study explored the feasibility of photoacoustic spectrum analysis (PASA) in identifying longitudinal changes of collagen modulated by CAFs using simulations and experiment studies. Optical and acoustic simulations in tissues were performed based on the histological slides of maximum cross-sections of murine malignancies to verify the effectiveness of photoacoustic (PA) detection system and the parameter "relative area of power spectrum density (APSD)". Experiments were conducted on three groups of mouse models with incremental ratios of CAFs and breast cancer cells at 3 continuous time points. Results discovered that the system configuration and APSD were capable of reflecting the evolution of collagen during cancer growth. Furthermore, cancers receiving a high dose of CAFs exhibited a suppressed collagen level. The presented methods show great potential for clinical translation of PASA in the field of cancer therapies targeting CAFs.</description>

      <title>In vivo impact on rabbit subchondral bone of viscosupplementation with a hyaluronic acid antioxidant conjugate</title>

Abstract: To assess the impact of an antioxidant-conjugated Hyaluronic Acid (HA) on articular cartilage and subchondral bone in the context of osteoarthritis (OA), we conducted a study using a hydrogel composed of HA-4-aminoresorcinol (HA4AR) and compared it to a commercially available high molecular weight HA formulation in a rabbit model of OA. Eighteen rabbits underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) and were categorized into three groups of six rabbits (Saline-group, HA-group and HA4AR-group) depending on the intra-articular injection compound. Eight contralateral knees were used as non-operated reference points (Contralateral-group). Iodine-enhanced micro-computed tomography imaging was performed six weeks post-surgery to study the articular cartilage volume and thickness as well as the subchondral bone microarchitectural parameters and mineral density. In the HA and HA4AR groups, the mean cartilage thickness was found to be similar to that of the Contralateral-group. However, when we compared the HA-group to the HA4AR-group, we observed a significant reduction in subchondral bone plate tissue mineral density (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, when we compared the HA4AR-group to the Saline-group, no significant differences were noted in trabecular subchondral bone microarchitectural parameters and subchondral bone plate and trabecular bone mineral densities. Additionally, when the HA-group was compared to the Saline-group, a notable decrease in subchondral bone plate tissue mineral density was evident (p&lt;0.01). Notably, the HA4AR hydrogel, comprising HA-antioxidant conjugate, effectively preserved subchondral bone plate tissue mineral density when compared to HA alone. Nevertheless, other aspects of bone microarchitectural parameters remained unaltered, resulting in subchondral bone mineral loss six weeks after surgery in the rabbit model.</description>
