      <title>Operator with the Kato property on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of bounded linear operators between Banach spaces, which we call operators with the Kato property, that includes the family of strictly singular operators between those spaces. We show that if $T:E\to F$ is a dense-range operator with that property and $E$ has a separable quotient, then for each proper dense operator range $R\subset E$ there exists a closed subspace $X\subset E$ such that $E/X$ is separable, $T(X)$ is dense in $F$ and $R+X$ is infinite-codimensional. If $E^*$ is weak$^*$-separable, the subspace $X$ can be built so that, in addition to the former properties, $R\cap X = \{0\}$. Some applications to the geometry of Banach spaces are given. In particular, we provide the next extensions of well-known results of Johnson and Plichko: if $X$ and $Y$ are quasicomplemented but not complemented subspaces of a Banach space $E$ and $X$ has a separable quotient, then $X$ contains a closed subspace $X_1\subset X$ such that $\dim (X/X_1)= \infty$ and $X_1$ is a quasicomplement of $Y$, and that if $T:E\to F$ is an operator with non-closed range and $E$ has a separable quotient, then there exists a weak$^*$-closed subspace $Z\subset E^*$ such that $T^*(F^*)\cap Z = \{0\}$. Some refinements of these results, in the case that $E^*$ is weak$^*$-separable, are also given. Finally, we show that if $E$ is a Banach space with a separable quotient, then $E^*$ is weak$^*$-separable if, and only if, for every closed subspace $X\subset E$ and every proper dense operator range $R\subset E$ there exists a quasicomplement $Y$ of $X$ in $E$ such that $Y\cap R = \{0\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21344v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Invariant Differential Operators and the Radon Transform on the Horocycle Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Radon transform for double fibrations of the horocycle spaces for the semisimple symmetric spaces with respect to the inclusion incidence relations. We present the inversion formula, support theorem and the range theorem by the invariant differential operators or the invariant system of differential operators constructed from the left action of the Pfaffian type elements in the universal enveloping algebra for the transformations group. In order to prove the range theorem, we make the explicit calculations of the Pfaffian type elements which lead to the calculations for the Harish-Chandra isomorphism of the central elements of the universal enveloping algebra. We deal with the Radon transform on the Schwartz space, the compactly supported smooth function spaces and the space of the sections of the line bundle. The range theorem on the space of the sections of the line bundle yields the range theorem for the Radon transform for double fibrations of compact homogeneous spaces which is not necessarily symmetric.</description>

      <title>A Dyadic Approach to Weak Characterizations of Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak-type quasi-norms are defined using the mean oscillation or the mean of a function on dyadic cubes, providing discrete analogues and variants of the corresponding quasi-norms on the upper half-space previously considered in the literature. Comparing the resulting function spaces to known function spaces such as $\dot{W}^{1,p}(\rn)$, $\JNp$, $\Lp$ and weak-$\Lp$ gives new embeddings and characterizations of these spaces. Examples are provided to prove the sharpness of the results.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12335v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this through a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations, along with a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.</description>

      <title>Real Non-Commutative Convexity I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the theory of real noncommutative (nc) convex sets, the real case of the recent and profound complex theory developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the real case of the topics from the first several sections of their profound memoir. Later results will be discussed in a future paper. We develop some of the infrastructure of real nc convexity, giving many foundational structural results for real operator systems and their associated nc convex sets, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic convexity theory constructions. Several new features appear in the real case, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex set.</description>
