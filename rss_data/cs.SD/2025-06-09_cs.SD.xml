      <title>A Fast and Lightweight Model for Causal Audio-Visual Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) aims to extract a target speech signal from a mixed signal by leveraging both auditory and visual (lip movement) cues. However, most existing AVSS methods exhibit complex architectures and rely on future context, operating offline, which renders them unsuitable for real-time applications. Inspired by the pipeline of RTFSNet, we propose a novel streaming AVSS model, named Swift-Net, which enhances the causal processing capabilities required for real-time applications. Swift-Net adopts a lightweight visual feature extraction module and an efficient fusion module for audio-visual integration. Additionally, Swift-Net employs Grouped SRUs to integrate historical information across different feature spaces, thereby improving the utilization efficiency of historical information. We further propose a causal transformation template to facilitate the conversion of non-causal AVSS models into causal counterparts. Experiments on three standard benchmark datasets (LRS2, LRS3, and VoxCeleb2) demonstrated that under causal conditions, our proposed Swift-Net exhibited outstanding performance, highlighting the potential of this method for processing speech in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Can Quantized Audio Language Models Perform Zero-Shot Spoofing Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large audio language models (LALMs) efficiently in resource-constrained environments. However, its impact on complex tasks, such as zero-shot audio spoofing detection, remains underexplored. This study evaluates the zero-shot capabilities of five LALMs, GAMA, LTU-AS, MERaLiON, Qwen-Audio, and SALMONN, across three distinct datasets: ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and WaveFake, and investigates their robustness to quantization (FP32, FP16, INT8). Despite high initial spoof detection accuracy, our analysis demonstrates severe predictive biases toward spoof classification across all models, rendering their practical performance equivalent to random classification. Interestingly, quantization to FP16 precision resulted in negligible performance degradation compared to FP32, effectively halving memory and computational requirements without materially impacting accuracy. However, INT8 quantization intensified model biases, significantly degrading balanced accuracy. These findings highlight critical architectural limitations and emphasize FP16 quantization as an optimal trade-off, providing guidelines for practical deployment and future model refinement.</description>

      <title>SynHate: Detecting Hate Speech in Synthetic Deepfake Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of deepfake audio and hate speech, powered by advanced text-to-speech, threatens online safety. We present SynHate, the first multilingual dataset for detecting hate speech in synthetic audio, spanning 37 languages. SynHate uses a novel four-class scheme: Real-normal, Real-hate, Fake-normal, and Fake-hate. Built from MuTox and ADIMA datasets, it captures diverse hate speech patterns globally and in India. We evaluate five leading self-supervised models (Whisper-small/medium, XLS-R, AST, mHuBERT), finding notable performance differences by language, with Whisper-small performing best overall. Cross-dataset generalization remains a challenge. By releasing SynHate and baseline code, we aim to advance robust, culturally sensitive, and multilingual solutions against synthetic hate speech. The dataset is available at https://www.iab-rubric.org/resources.</description>

      <title>"In This Environment, As That Speaker": A Text-Driven Framework for Multi-Attribute Speech Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose TES-VC (Text-driven Environment and Speaker controllable Voice Conversion), a text-driven voice conversion framework with independent control of speaker timbre and environmental acoustics. TES-VC processes simultaneous text inputs for target voice and environment, accurately generating speech matching described timbre/environment while preserving source content. Trained on synthetic data with decoupled vocal/environment features via latent diffusion modeling, our method eliminates interference between attributes. The Retrieval-Based Timbre Control (RBTC) module enables precise manipulation using abstract descriptions without paired data. Experiments confirm TES-VC effectively generates contextually appropriate speech in both timbre and environment with high content retention and superior controllability which demonstrates its potential for widespread applications.</description>

      <title>Insights on Harmonic Tones from a Generative Music Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate purpose of generative music AI is music production. The studio-lab, a social form within the art-science branch of cross-disciplinarity, is a way to advance music production with AI music models. During a studio-lab experiment involving researchers, music producers, and an AI model for music generating bass-like audio, it was observed that the producers used the model's output to convey two or more pitches with a single harmonic complex tone, which in turn revealed that the model had learned to generate structured and coherent simultaneous melodic lines using monophonic sequences of harmonic complex tones. These findings prompt a reconsideration of the long-standing debate on whether humans can perceive harmonics as distinct pitches and highlight how generative AI can not only enhance musical creativity but also contribute to a deeper understanding of music.</description>

      <title>Streaming Endpointer for Spoken Dialogue using Neural Audio Codecs and Label-Delayed Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, low-latency endpointing is crucial for effective spoken dialogue systems. While traditional endpointers often rely on spectrum-based audio features, this work proposes real-time speech endpointing for multi-turn dialogues using streaming, low-bitrate Neural Audio Codec (NAC) features, building upon recent advancements in neural audio codecs. To further reduce cutoff errors, we introduce a novel label delay training scheme. At a fixed median latency of 160 ms, our combined NAC and label delay approach achieves significant relative cutoff error reductions: 42.7% for a single-stream endpointer and 37.5% for a two-stream configuration, compared to baseline methods. Finally, we demonstrate efficient integration with a codec-based pretrained speech large language model, improving its median response time by 1200 ms and reducing its cutoff error by 35%.</description>

      <title>RBA-FE: A Robust Brain-Inspired Audio Feature Extractor for Depression Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a robust brain-inspired audio feature extractor (RBA-FE) model for depression diagnosis, using an improved hierarchical network architecture. Most deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance for image-based diagnostic tasks, ignoring the counterpart audio features. In order to tailor the noise challenge, RBA-FE leverages six acoustic features extracted from the raw audio, capturing both spatial characteristics and temporal dependencies. This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision limitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep residual shrinkage networks. To deal with the noise issues, our model incorporates an improved spiking neuron model, called adaptive rate smooth leaky integrate-and-fire (ARSLIF). The ARSLIF model emulates the mechanism of ``retuning of cellular signal selectivity" in the brain attention systems, which enhances the model robustness against environmental noises in audio data. Experimental results demonstrate that RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MODMA dataset, respectively with 0.8750, 0.8974, 0.8750 and 0.8750 in precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014 and DAIC-WOZ datasets both show enhancements in noise robustness. It is further indicated by comparison that the ARSLIF neuron model suggest the abnormal firing pattern within the feature extraction on depressive audio data, offering brain-inspired interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report introduces innovative optimizations for Kaldi-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, focusing on acoustic model enhancement, hyperparameter tuning, and language model efficiency. We developed a custom Conformer block integrated with a multistream TDNN-F structure, enabling superior feature extraction and temporal modeling.

      <title>Audio synthesizer inversion in symmetric parameter spaces with approximately equivariant flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many audio synthesizers can produce the same signal given different parameter configurations, meaning the inversion from sound to parameters is an inherently ill-posed problem. We show that this is largely due to intrinsic symmetries of the synthesizer, and focus in particular on permutation invariance. First, we demonstrate on a synthetic task that regressing point estimates under permutation symmetry degrades performance, even when using a permutation-invariant loss function or symmetry-breaking heuristics. Then, viewing equivalent solutions as modes of a probability distribution, we show that a conditional generative model substantially improves performance. Further, acknowledging the invariance of the implicit parameter distribution, we find that performance is further improved by using a permutation equivariant continuous normalizing flow. To accommodate intricate symmetries in real synthesizers, we also propose a relaxed equivariance strategy that adaptively discovers relevant symmetries from data. Applying our method to Surge XT, a full-featured open source synthesizer used in real world audio production, we find our method outperforms regression and generative baselines across audio reconstruction metrics.</description>

      <title>Methods for pitch analysis in contemporary popular music: Vitalic's use of tones that do not operate on the principle of acoustic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vitalic is an electronic music producer who has been active since 2001. Vitalic's 2005 track "No Fun" features a main synthesiser part built from a sequence of single inharmonic tones that evoke two simultaneous melodies. This part serves as a starting point for examining Vitalic's use of tones that do not operate on the principle of acoustic resonance. The study considers tones that evoke two or more simultaneous pitches and examines various inharmonic partial layouts. Examples outside Vitalic's music are also provided to suggest that similar tone properties can be found elsewhere in contemporary popular music.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalized Source Tracing for Codec-Based Deepfake Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech (CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network (SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+ dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.</description>

      <title>Speech Recognition on TV Series with Video-guided Post-Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved remarkable success with deep learning, driving advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, media transcription, and assistive technologies. However, ASR systems still struggle in complex environments such as TV series, where overlapping speech, domain-specific terminology, and long-range contextual dependencies pose significant challenges to transcription accuracy. Existing multimodal approaches fail to correct ASR outputs with the rich temporal and contextual information available in video. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal post-correction framework that refines ASR transcriptions by leveraging contextual cues extracted from video. Our framework consists of two stages: ASR Generation and Video-based Post-Correction, where the first stage produces the initial transcript and the second stage corrects errors using Video-based Contextual Information Extraction and Context-aware ASR Correction. We employ the Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) to extract key contextual information using tailored prompts, which is then integrated with a Large Language Model (LLM) to refine the ASR output. We evaluate our method on a multimodal benchmark for TV series ASR and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving ASR performance by leveraging video-based context to enhance transcription accuracy in complex multimedia environments.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Joint Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection via Single-Stream Multi-Modal Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfakes are AI-synthesized multimedia data that may be abused for spreading misinformation. Deepfake generation involves both visual and audio manipulation. To detect audio-visual deepfakes, previous studies commonly employ two relatively independent sub-models to learn audio and visual features, respectively, and fuse them subsequently for deepfake detection. However, this may underutilize the inherent correlations between audio and visual features. Moreover, utilizing two isolated feature learning sub-models can result in redundant neural layers, making the overall model inefficient and impractical for resource-constrained environments.
  In this work, we design a lightweight network for audio-visual deepfake detection via a single-stream multi-modal learning framework. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative audio-visual learning block to efficiently integrate multi-modal information while learning the visual and audio features. By iteratively employing this block, our single-stream network achieves a continuous fusion of multi-modal features across its layers. Thus, our network efficiently captures visual and audio features without the need for excessive block stacking, resulting in a lightweight network design. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal classification module that can boost the dependence of the visual and audio classifiers on modality content. It also enhances the whole resistance of the video classifier against the mismatches between audio and visual modalities. We conduct experiments on the DF-TIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and DFDC benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art audio-visual joint detection methods, our method is significantly lightweight with only 0.48M parameters, yet it achieves superiority in both uni-modal and multi-modal deepfakes, as well as in unseen types of deepfakes.</description>

      <title>An introduction to pitch strength in contemporary popular music analysis and production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music information retrieval distinguishes between low- and high-level descriptions of music. Current generative AI models rely on text descriptions that are higher level than the controls familiar to studio musicians. Pitch strength, a low-level perceptual parameter of contemporary popular music, may be one feature that could make such AI models more suited to music production. Signal and perceptual analyses suggest that pitch strength (1) varies significantly across and inside songs; (2) contributes to both small- and large-scale structure; (3) contributes to the handling of polyphonic dissonance; and (4) may be a feature of upper harmonics made audible in a perspective of perceptual richness.</description>

      <title>Towards Energy-Efficient and Low-Latency Voice-Controlled Smart Homes: A Proposal for Offline Speech Recognition and IoT Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The smart home systems, based on AI speech recognition and IoT technology, enable people to control devices through verbal commands and make people's lives more efficient. However, existing AI speech recognition services are primarily deployed on cloud platforms on the Internet. When users issue a command, speech recognition devices like ``Amazon Echo'' will post a recording through numerous network nodes, reach multiple servers, and then receive responses through the Internet. This mechanism presents several issues, including unnecessary energy consumption, communication latency, and the risk of a single-point failure. In this position paper, we propose a smart home concept based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology: 1) integrating offline keyword spotting (KWS) technologies into household appliances with limited resource hardware to enable them to understand user voice commands; 2) designing a local IoT network with decentralized architecture to manage and connect various devices, enhancing the robustness and scalability of the system. This proposal of a smart home based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology will allow users to use low-latency voice control anywhere in the home without depending on the Internet and provide better scalability and energy sustainability.</description>

      <title>LeVo: High-Quality Song Generation with Multi-Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to limitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental results demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both objective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples are available at https://levo-demo.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Generative Voice Bursts during Phone Call</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In critical situations, conventional mobile telephony fails to convey emergency voice messages to a callee already engaged in another call. The standard call waiting alert does not provide the urgency or content of the waiting call. This paper proposes a novel method for transmitting Generative Voice Bursts short, context aware audio messages during ongoing calls, from either preauthorized or dynamically prioritized callers. By leveraging generative AI techniques, the system automatically generates spoken messages from contextual inputs example like location, health data, images, background noise when the caller is unable to speak due to incapacitation or environmental constraints. The solution incorporates voice, text, and priority inference mechanisms, allowing high priority emergency messages to bypass conventional call waiting barriers. The approach employs models such as GPT Neo for generative text, which is synthesized into audio and delivered in configurable intervals G seconds and counts N times, ensuring minimal disruption while preserving urgency. This method holds potential for significant impact across telecom, mobile device manufacturing, and emergency communication platforms.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Benchmark for Arabic Pronunciation Assessment: Quranic Recitation as Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified benchmark for mispronunciation detection in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) using Qur'anic recitation as a case study. Our approach lays the groundwork for advancing Arabic pronunciation assessment by providing a comprehensive pipeline that spans data processing, the development of a specialized phoneme set tailored to the nuances of MSA pronunciation, and the creation of the first publicly available test set for this task, which we term as the Qur'anic Mispronunciation Benchmark (QuranMB.v1). Furthermore, we evaluate several baseline models to provide initial performance insights, thereby highlighting both the promise and the challenges inherent in assessing MSA pronunciation. By establishing this standardized framework, we aim to foster further research and development in pronunciation assessment in Arabic language technology and related applications.</description>

      <title>TESU-LLM: Training Speech-LLMs Without Speech via Unified Encoder Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech LLMs without speech data.</description>

      <title>Bridging Audio and Vision: Zero-Shot Audiovisual Segmentation by Connecting Pretrained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps, enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for finegrained audiovisual segmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several machine learning algorithms have been developed for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) from spontaneous speech. However, none of these algorithms have been translated for the prediction of broader cognitive impairment (CI), which in some cases is a precursor and risk factor of ADRD. In this paper, we evaluated several speech-based open-source methods originally proposed for the prediction of ADRD, as well as methods from multimodal sentiment analysis for the task of predicting CI from patient audio recordings. Results demonstrated that multimodal methods outperformed unimodal ones for CI prediction, and that acoustics-based approaches performed better than linguistics-based ones. Specifically, interpretable acoustic features relating to affect and prosody were found to significantly outperform BERT-based linguistic features and interpretable linguistic features, respectively. All the code developed for this study is available at https://github.com/JTColonel/catch.</description>

      <title>Accurate analysis of the pitch pulse-based magnitude/phase structure of natural vowels and assessment of three lightweight time/frequency voicing restoration methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whispered speech is produced when the vocal folds are not used, either intentionally, or due to a temporary or permanent voice condition. The essential difference between natural speech and whispered speech is that periodic signal components that exist in certain regions of the former, called voiced regions, as a consequence of the vibration of the vocal folds, are missing in the latter. The restoration of natural speech from whispered speech requires delicate signal processing procedures that are especially useful if they can be implemented on low-resourced portable devices, in real-time, and on-the-fly, taking advantage of the established source-filter paradigm of voice production and related models. This paper addresses two challenges that are intertwined and are key in informing and making viable this envisioned technological realization. The first challenge involves characterizing and modeling the evolution of the harmonic phase/magnitude structure of a sequence of individual pitch periods in a voiced region of natural speech comprising sustained or co-articulated vowels. This paper proposes a novel algorithm segmenting individual pitch pulses, which is then used to obtain illustrative results highlighting important differences between sustained and co-articulated vowels, and suggesting practical synthetic voicing approaches. The second challenge involves model-based synthetic voicing. Three implementation alternatives are described that differ in their signal reconstruction approaches: frequency-domain, combined frequency and time-domain, and physiologically-inspired separate filtering of glottal excitation pulses individually generated. The three alternatives are compared objectively using illustrative examples, and subjectively using the results of listening tests involving synthetic voicing of sustained and co-articulated vowels in word context.</description>

      <title>Beyond Classification: Towards Speech Emotion Reasoning with Multitask AudioLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned, evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision, dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and evidential grounding of the generated responses.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Spatial Language Maps for Robot Navigation and Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand. Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models. This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by 50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual, audio, and spatial cues.</description>

      <title>Automatic Speech Recognition of African American English: Lexical and Contextual Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic, phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English (AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction (CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.</description>

      <title>E-BATS: Efficient Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i) lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii) a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Speaker-Distinguishable CTC: Learning Speaker Distinction Using CTC for Multi-Talker Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech recognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output Training (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to speaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such as token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such information from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address this limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension of CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each frame. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT model to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and transcriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with SD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic labels on a given audio-transcript pair, aimed at constructing Japanese text-to-speech (TTS) datasets. Our approach involves fine-tuning a large-scale pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, conditioned on ground truth transcripts, to simultaneously output phrase-level graphemes and annotation labels. To further correct errors in phonemic labeling, we employ a decoding strategy that utilizes dictionary prior knowledge. The objective evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous approaches relying solely on text or audio. The subjective evaluation results indicate that the naturalness of speech synthesized by the TTS model, trained with labels annotated using our method, is comparable to that of a model trained with manual annotations.</description>

      <title>A Hypernetwork-Based Approach to KAN Representation of Audio Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) have gained prominence for efficiently encoding multimedia data, yet their applications in audio signals remain limited. This study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a novel architecture using learnable activation functions, as an effective INR model for audio representation. KAN demonstrates superior perceptual performance over previous INRs, achieving the lowest Log-SpectralDistance of 1.29 and the highest Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality of 3.57 for 1.5 s audio. To extend KAN's utility, we propose FewSound, a hypernetwork-based architecture that enhances INR parameter updates. FewSound outperforms the state-of-the-art HyperSound, with a 33.3% improvement in MSE and 60.87% in SI-SNR. These results show KAN as a robust and adaptable audio representation with the potential for scalability and integration into various hypernetwork frameworks.

      <title>FLAM: Frame-Wise Language-Audio Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent multi-modal audio-language models (ALMs) excel at text-audio retrieval but struggle with frame-wise audio understanding. Prior works use temporal-aware labels or unsupervised training to improve frame-wise capabilities, but they still lack fine-grained labeling capability to pinpoint when an event occurs. While traditional sound event detection models can precisely localize events, they are limited to pre-defined categories, making them ineffective for real-world scenarios with out-of-distribution events. In this work, we introduce FLAM, an open-vocabulary contrastive audio-language model capable of localizing specific sound events. FLAM employs a memory-efficient and calibrated frame-wise objective with logit adjustment to address spurious correlations, such as event dependencies and label imbalances during training. To enable frame-wise supervision, we leverage a large-scale dataset with diverse audio events, LLM-generated captions and simulation. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that FLAM significantly improves the open-vocabulary localization capability while maintaining strong performance in global retrieval and downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Training Articulatory Inversion Models for Interspeaker Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) attempts to model the inverse mapping from speech to articulation. Exact articulatory prediction from speech alone may be impossible, as speakers can choose different forms of articulation seemingly without reference to their vocal tract structure. However, once a speaker has selected an articulatory form, their productions vary minimally. Recent works in AAI have proposed adapting Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models to single-speaker datasets, claiming that these single-speaker models provide a universal articulatory template. In this paper, we investigate whether SSL-adapted models trained on single and multi-speaker data produce articulatory targets which are consistent across speaker identities for English and Russian. We do this through the use of a novel evaluation method which extracts articulatory targets using minimal pair sets. We also present a training method which can improve interspeaker consistency using only speech data.</description>

      <title>DnR-nonverbal: Cinematic Audio Source Separation Dataset Containing Non-Verbal Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new dataset for cinematic audio source separation (CASS) that handles non-verbal sounds. Existing CASS datasets only contain reading-style sounds as a speech stem. These datasets differ from actual movie audio, which is more likely to include acted-out voices. Consequently, models trained on conventional datasets tend to have issues where emotionally heightened voices, such as laughter and screams, are more easily separated as an effect, not speech. To address this problem, we build a new dataset, DnR-nonverbal. The proposed dataset includes non-verbal sounds like laughter and screams in the speech stem. From the experiments, we reveal the issue of non-verbal sound extraction by the current CASS model and show that our dataset can effectively address the issue in the synthetic and actual movie audio. Our dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/15470640.</description>

      <title>LLaSE-G1: Incentivizing Generalization Capability for LLaMA-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Imagine to Hear: Auditory Knowledge Generation can be an Effective Assistant for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models pretrained on text-only corpora often struggle with tasks that require auditory commonsense knowledge. Previous work addresses this problem by augmenting the language model to retrieve knowledge from external audio databases. This approach has several limitations, such as the potential lack of relevant audio in databases and the high costs associated with constructing the databases. To address these issues, we propose Imagine to Hear, a novel approach that dynamically generates auditory knowledge using generative models. Our framework detects multiple audio-related textual spans from the given prompt and generates corresponding auditory knowledge. We develop several mechanisms to efficiently process multiple auditory knowledge, including a CLAP-based rejection sampler and a language-audio fusion module. Our experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AuditoryBench without relying on external databases, highlighting the effectiveness of our generation-based approach.</description>

      <title>Baseline Systems and Evaluation Metrics for Spatial Semantic Segmentation of Sound Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Immersive communication has made significant advancements, especially with the release of the codec for Immersive Voice and Audio Services. Aiming at its further realization, the DCASE 2025 Challenge has recently introduced a task for spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5), which focuses on detecting and separating sound events in spatial sound scenes. In this paper, we explore methods for addressing the S5 task. Specifically, we present baseline S5 systems that combine audio tagging (AT) and label-queried source separation (LSS) models. We investigate two LSS approaches based on the ResUNet architecture: a) extracting a single source for each detected event and b) querying multiple sources concurrently. Since each separated source in S5 is identified by its sound event class label, we propose new class-aware metrics to evaluate both the sound sources and labels simultaneously. Experimental results on first-order ambisonics spatial audio demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed systems and confirm the efficacy of the metrics.</description>

      <title>NTPP: Generative Speech Language Modeling for Dual-Channel Spoken Dialogue via Next-Token-Pair Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Inter-Speaker Relative Cues for Text-Guided Target Speech Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach that utilizes inter-speaker relative cues to distinguish target speakers and extract their voices from mixtures. Continuous cues (e.g., temporal order, age, pitch level) are grouped by relative differences, while discrete cues (e.g., language, gender, emotion) retain their categorical distinctions. Compared to fixed speech attribute classification, inter-speaker relative cues offer greater flexibility, facilitating much easier expansion of text-guided target speech extraction datasets. Our experiments show that combining all relative cues yields better performance than random subsets, with gender and temporal order being the most robust across languages and reverberant conditions. Additional cues, such as pitch level, loudness, distance, speaking duration, language, and pitch range, also demonstrate notable benefits in complex scenarios. Fine-tuning pre-trained WavLM Base+ CNN encoders improves overall performance over the Conv1d baseline.</description>
