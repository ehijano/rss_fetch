      <title>Keep it Tighter -- A Story on Analytical Mean Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel techniques are among the most popular and flexible approaches in data science allowing to represent probability measures without loss of information under mild conditions. The resulting mapping called mean embedding gives rise to a divergence measure referred to as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with existing quadratic-time estimators (w.r.t. the sample size) and known convergence properties for bounded kernels. In this paper we focus on the problem of MMD estimation when the mean embedding of one of the underlying distributions is available analytically. Particularly, we consider distributions on the real line (motivated by financial applications) and prove tighter concentration for the proposed estimator under this semi-explicit setting; we also extend the result to the case of unbounded (exponential) kernel with minimax-optimal lower bounds. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach beyond synthetic example in three real-world examples relying on one-dimensional random variables: index replication and calibration on loss-given-default ratios and on S&amp;P 500 data.</description>

      <title>Randomization of Short-Rate Models, Analytic Pricing and Flexibility in Controlling Implied Volatilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on extending existing short-rate models, enabling control of the generated implied volatility while preserving analyticity. We achieve this goal by applying the Randomized Affine Diffusion (RAnD) method to the class of short-rate processes under the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework. Under arbitrage-free conditions, the model parameters can be exogenously stochastic, thus facilitating additional degrees of freedom that enhance the calibration procedure. We show that with the randomized short-rate models, the shapes of implied volatility can be controlled and significantly improve the quality of the model calibration, even for standard 1D variants. In particular, we illustrate that randomization applied to the Hull-White model leads to dynamics of the local volatility type, with the prices for standard volatility-sensitive derivatives explicitly available. The randomized Hull-White (rHW) model offers an almost perfect calibration fit to the swaption implied volatilities.</description>

      <title>Cross-Currency Heath-Jarrow-Morton Framework in the Multiple-Curve Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general HJM framework for forward contracts written on abstract market indices with arbitrary fixing and payment adjustments, and featuring collateralization in any currency denominations. In view of this, we first provide a thorough study of cross-currency markets in the presence of collateral and incompleteness. Then we give a general treatment of collateral dislocations by describing the instantaneous cross-currency basis spreads by means of HJM models, for which we derive appropriate drift conditions. The framework obtained allows us to simultaneously cover forward-looking risky IBOR rates, such as EURIBOR, and backward-looking rates based on overnight rates, such as SOFR. Due to the discrepancies in market conventions of different currency areas created by the benchmark transition, this is pivotal for describing portfolios of interest-rate products that are denominated in multiple currencies. As an example of contract simultaneously depending on all the risk factors that we describe within our framework, we treat cross-currency swaps using our proposed abstract indices.</description>
