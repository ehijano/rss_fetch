      <title>Quadrilateral Particle Arrangement within Shocks in a Two-Dimensional Dusty Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic structure within a two-dimensional shock was studied using data from a dusty plasma experiment. A single layer of charged microparticles, levitated in a glow-discharge plasma, was perturbed by an electrically floating wire that was moved at a steady supersonic speed to excite a compressional shock. A rearrangement of particles was observed, from a hexagonal lattice in the preshock into a quadrilateral microstructure within the shock. This quadrilateral structure would not be stable in a monolayer of identical repulsive particles, under equilibrium conditions. Glaser-Clark polygon analysis of the microstructure helped in identifying quadrilaterals. Voronoi analysis was used to characterize the defect fraction behind the shock, as an indication of shock-induced melting.</description>

      <title>The Independence of Magnetic Turbulent Power Spectra to the Presence of Switchbacks in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An outstanding gap in our knowledge of the solar wind is the relationship between switchbacks and solar wind turbulence. Switchbacks are large fluctuations, even reversals, of the background magnetic field embedded in the solar wind flow. It has been proposed that switchbacks may form as a product of turbulence and decay via coupling with the turbulent cascade. In this work, we examine how properties of solar wind magnetic field turbulence vary in the presence or absence of switchbacks. Specifically, we use in-situ particle and fields measurements from Parker Solar Probe to measure magnetic field turbulent wave power, separately in the inertial and kinetic ranges, as a function of switchback magnetic deflection angle. We demonstrate that the angle between the background magnetic field and the solar wind velocity in the spacecraft frame ($\theta_{vB}$) strongly determines whether Parker Solar Probe samples wave power parallel or perpendicular to the background magnetic field. Further, we show that $\theta_{vB}$ is strongly modulated by the switchback magnetic deflection angle. In this analysis, we demonstrate that switchback deflection angle does not correspond to any significant increase in wave power in either the inertial range or at kinetic scales. This result implies that switchbacks do not strongly couple to the turbulent cascade in the inertial or kinetic ranges via turbulent wave-particle interactions. Therefore, we do not expect switchbacks to contribute significantly to solar wind heating through this type of energy conversion pathway, although contributions via other mechanisms, such as magnetic reconnection may still be significant.</description>

      <title>Spin caloric resistance of Dirac plasma in graphene Corbino device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal resistance of a spin-polarized hydrodynamic Dirac plasma in graphene is considered. A mechanism for the coupling of heat and spin flows is discussed, demonstrating that spin diffusion and spin thermocurrent modify viscous dissipation, leading to a significant enhancement of thermal resistance. Practical calculations are then presented for graphene devices in the Corbino geometry.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields with General Omnigenity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Omnigenity is a desirable property of toroidal magnetic fields that ensures confinement of trapped particles. Confining charged particles is a basic requirement for any fusion power plant design, but it can be difficult to satisfy with the non-axisymmetric magnetic fields used by the stellarator approach. Every ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium previously found to approximate omnigenity has been either axisymmetric, quasi-symmetric or has poloidally closed contours of magnetic field strength $B$. However, general omnigenous equilibria are a much larger design space than these subsets. A new model is presented and employed in the DESC stellarator optimization suite to represent and discover the full parameter space of omnigenous equilibria. Although exact omnigenity aside from quasi-symmetry is impossible, these results reveal that excellent particle confinement can be achieved in practice. Examples far from quasi-symmetry with poloidally, helically and toroidally closed $B$ contours are attained with DESC and shown to have low neoclassical collisional transport and fast particle losses.</description>

      <title>Improved Divertor Performance in Strongly Baffled, Alternative Divertors on MAST Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Managing power exhaust from fusion core plasma is crucial for advancing fusion energy. The MAST Upgrade tokamak distinctively integrates strong neutral baffling - to segregate the exhaust area (divertor) from the fusion core - with advanced divertor shaping, enabling long-legged divertors and high total flux expansion ($F_R = B_{xpt}/B_t$ up to 2.3). This study provides compelling experimental evidence that such configurations markedly reduce target heat and particle loads, representing a significant step forward in addressing the fusion power exhaust challenge. Our comparative analysis of various divertor shapes demonstrates that even modest adjustments can significantly enhance exhaust performance while preserving core plasma performance. Through novel analysis, we attribute the reductions in particle and power loads to the expanded plasma-neutral interaction volume within long-legged divertors. Importantly, the neutral buffer formed in front of the target is highly resistant to variations of the plasma state in strongly baffled, long-legged divertors with $F_R &gt; 1.6$. Our results underscore the critical role of strategic divertor shaping in enhancing exhaust performance, stability and core-edge integration, aligning with reduced models and simulation forecasts. This study not only paves new avenues for optimising power exhaust systems but also signifies an essential advancement towards sustainable fusion energy.</description>

      <title>Comparing growth of titania and carbonaceous dusty nanoparticles in weakly magnetised capacitively coupled plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the growth cycles of titania and carbonaceous dusty nanoparticles in capacitively coupled radiofrequency plasmas, focusing on the impact of weak magnetic field of approximately 480 Gauss. The growth of dusty nanoparticles in these plasmas is cyclic, with particles reaching their maximum size and subsequently moving out of the plasma, followed by the initiation of a new particle growth cycle. We compare the growth of titania and carbonaceous dusty particles in the presence and absence of a magnetic field. The presence of the magnetic field fastens the growth cycle in both types of dusty plasmas. Langmuir probe measurement of the background plasma parameters such as electron temperature and floating potential reveal radial variations in floating potential but not electron temperature. Furthermore, the magnetic field changes the radial variation of floating potential. The magnetic field also influences the spatial distribution of the two dust cloud differently. It is possible that these differences arises due to the material's different response to the magnetic field. These findings shed light on the intricate dynamics of titania and carbonaceous dusty plasma particle growth, offering insights into the impact of weak magnetization on dust behavior, which have implications for various applications, from space science to semiconductor processing.</description>

      <title>Entangling cavity-magnon polaritons by interacting with phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15217v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to entangle two cavity-magnon polaritons (CMPs) formed by two strongly coupled microwave cavity and magnon modes. This is realized by introducing vibration phonons, via magnetostriction, into the system that are dispersively coupled to the magnon mode. Stationary entanglement between two CMPs can be achieved when they are respectively resonant with the two sidebands of the drive field scattered by the phonons, and when the proportions of the cavity and magnon modes in the two polaritons are appropriately chosen. The entangled CMPs can improve the detection sensitivity in the dark matter search experiments using CMPs, and can also lead to the emission of frequency-entangled microwave photons.</description>
