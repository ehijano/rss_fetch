      <title>IDRIFTNET: Physics-Driven Spatiotemporal Deep Learning for Iceberg Drift Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drifting icebergs in the polar oceans play a key role in the Earth's climate system, impacting freshwater fluxes into the ocean and regional ecosystems while also posing a challenge to polar navigation. However, accurately forecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of iceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg motion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a highly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These limitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture the underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep learning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift physics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the pattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth observations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network that captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future iceberg drift positions. We compare IDRIFTNET model performance with state-of-the-art models on two Antarctic icebergs: A23A and B22A. Our findings demonstrate that IDRIFTNET outperforms other models by achieving a lower Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) across a variety of time points. These results highlight IDRIFTNET's effectiveness in capturing the complex, nonlinear drift of icebergs for forecasting iceberg trajectories under limited data and dynamic environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Guided Unconditional and Conditional Generative Models for Super-Resolution and Inference of Quasi-Geostrophic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of the ocean, weather, and climate are coarse, and observations are sparse and gappy. In this work, we apply four generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process score. The other two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and observation data. We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and quantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors. We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength. Results show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates reasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed fine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with observations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra. Further, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the trade-offs between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment in geophysical inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Towards NoahMP-AI: Enhancing Land Surface Model Prediction with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate soil moisture prediction during extreme events remains a critical challenge for earth system modeling, with profound implications for drought monitoring, flood forecasting, and climate adaptation strategies. While land surface models (LSMs) provide physically-based predictions, they exhibit systematic biases during extreme conditions when their parameterizations operate outside calibrated ranges. Here we present NoahMP-AI, a physics-guided deep learning framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging the complete Noah-MP land surface model as a comprehensive physics-based feature generator while using machine learning to correct structural limitations against satellite observations. We employ a 3D U-Net architecture that processes Noah-MP outputs (soil moisture, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux) to predict SMAP soil moisture across two contrasting extreme events: a prolonged drought (March-September 2022) and Hurricane Beryl (July 2024) over Texas. When comparing NoahMP-AI with NoahMP, our results demonstrate an increase in R-squared values from -0.7 to 0.5 during drought conditions, while maintaining physical consistency and spatial coherence. The framework's ability to preserve Noah-MP's physical relationships while learning observation-based corrections represents a significant advance in hybrid earth system modeling. This work establishes both a practical tool for operational forecasting and a benchmark for investigating the optimal integration of physics-based understanding with data-driven learning in environmental prediction systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Wind Gust Predictions in the Northeast United States: An Evidential Neural Network and Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have shown promise in reducing bias in wind gust predictions, while still underpredicting high gusts. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) supports this issue by identifying when predictions are reliable or need cautious interpretation. Using data from 61 extratropical storms in the Northeastern USA, we introduce evidential neural network (ENN) as a novel approach for UQ in gust predictions, leveraging atmospheric variables from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Explainable AI techniques suggested that key predictive features contributed to higher uncertainty, which correlated strongly with storm intensity and spatial gust gradients. Compared to WRF, ENN demonstrated a 47% reduction in RMSE and allowed the construction of gust prediction intervals without an ensemble, successfully capturing at least 95% of observed gusts at 179 out of 266 stations. From an operational perspective, providing gust forecasts with quantified uncertainty enhances stakeholders' confidence in risk assessment and response planning for extreme gust events.</description>
