      <title>Triangle functions generated by products of quantales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that, given a left continuous t-norm $T$ on $[0,1]$ and a right continuous $\CL$-operation $L$ on $[0,\infty]$, then their tensor product $L\otimes T$ is a triangle function on $\Delp$. Hence, $(\Delp,L\otimes T)$ becomes a partially ordered monoid. In this paper, it is shown that: (1) $L\otimes T$ coincides with the triangle function $\tau_{T,L}$ if and only if $L$ satisfies the condition $(LCS)$; (2) let $\CDp$ be the set of all non-defective distance distribution functions, then $(\CDp,L\otimes T)$ is a submonoid of $(\Delp,L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ has no zero divisor; (3) let $\CDp_c$ be the set of all continuous distance distribution functions, then for each continuous t-norm $T$, $(\CDp_c, L\otimes T)$ is a subsemigroup of $(\Delp,L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ satisfies the condition $(LS)$. Moreover, $(\CDp_c,L\otimes T)$ is an ideal of $(\CDp,L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ satisfies the cancellation law.</description>

      <title>Operator Characterization via Projectors and Nilpotents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores operators with countable, continuous, and hybrid spectra, focusing on both finite dimensional and infinite dimensional cases, particularly in non-Hermitian systems. For finite dimensional operators, a novel concept of analogous matrices is introduced. Here, matrices are considered analogous if they share the same projector and nilpotent structures, indicating structural equivalences beyond simple spectral similarities. A graph-based model represents these projector and nilpotent structures, offering insights for classifying analogous matrices. Additionally, the paper calculates the distinct families of analogous matrices by matrix size, establishing a tool for matrix classification.
  The study extends the spectral mapping theorem to multivariate functions of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian matrices, expanding the applicability of spectral theory. This theorem assumes holomorphic functions, enabling its use with a broader class of operators. The finite dimensional framework is further generalized to infinite dimensional cases, covering operators with countable spectra to deepen understanding of operator behavior.
  For continuous spectrum operators, this work generalizes von Neumann's spectral theorem to encompass a wider class of spectral operators, including both self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint cases. This unified approach supports a generalized spectral decomposition, facilitating application of the spectral mapping theorem across various contexts. The concept of analogous operators is also extended to continuous spectrum operators, forming a basis for their classification. Finally, operators with hybrid spectra comprising both discrete and continuous elements are examined, with analogous properties and spectral mapping explored within this context.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of Distance Matrices, the Second Look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here the definitions of nearest neighbor, robustness, concordance, and correlation, all of which feature in (Temple 2023) (henceforth abbreviated (T23)), are adjusted to make them completely mathematical while preserving their significance. A characterization is given of the possible limits of a function of distance matrices as the data matrices from which they are derived acquire more and more columns while their number of rows and the distance defining norm (= coefficient, in the terminology of (T23)) are held fixed. No data contribute to the discussion here, but many examples, with standard norms and data matrices having just a few rows and columns, play an important role. Indeed, small data matrices are displayed showing that robustness, defined either of the two ways, can be zero.</description>

      <title>Positive definite functions as uniformly ergodic multipliers of the Fourier algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a locally compact group and let $\phi$ be a positive definite function on G with $\phi(e)=1$. This function defines a multiplication operator $M_\phi$ on the Fourier algebra $A(G)$ of $G$. The aim of this paper is to classify the ergodic properties of the operators $M_\phi$, focusing on several key factors, including the subgroup $H_\phi=\{x\in G\colon \phi(x)=1\}$, the spectrum of $M_\phi$, or how ``spread-out'' a power of $M_\phi$ can be. We show that the multiplication operator $M_\phi$ is uniformly mean ergodic if and only if $H_\phi$ is open and 1 is not an accumulation point of the spectrum of $M_\phi$. Equivalently, this happens when some power of $\phi$ is not far, in the multiplier norm, from a function supported on finitely many cosets of $H_\phi$. Additionally, we show that the powers of $M_\phi$ converge in norm if, and only if, the operator is uniformly mean ergodic and $H_\phi =\{x\in G\colon |\phi(x)|=1\}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum KKL-type Inequalities Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we develop the random restriction method in the quantum framework. By applying this method, we establish the quantum Eldan-Gross inequality, the quantum Talagrand isoperimetric inequality, and related quantum KKL-type inequalities. Our results recover some recent results of Rouz\'e et al. \cite{RWZ2024} and Jiao et al. \cite{JLZ2025}, which can be viewed as alternative answers to the quantum KKL conjecture proposed by Motanaro and Osborne in \cite{MO2010}.</description>

      <title>Ryll-Wojtaszczyk Formulas for bihomogeneous polynomials on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate projection constants for spaces of bihomogeneous harmonic and bihomogeneous polynomials on the unit sphere in finite-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces. Using averaging techniques, we demonstrate that the minimal norm projection aligns with the natural orthogonal projection. This result enables us to establish a connection between these constants and weighted \linebreak $L_1$-norms of specific Jacobi polynomials. Consequently, we derive explicit bounds, provide practical expressions for computation, and present asymptotically sharp estimates for these constants. Our findings extend the classical Ryll and Wojtaszczyk formula for the projection constant of homogeneous polynomials in finite-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces to the bihomogeneous setting.</description>

Abstract: For a generalization of the Gellerstedt operator with mixed-type Dirichlet boundary conditions to a suitable Tricomi domain, we prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of the linear problem and for a generalization of this problem. The classical method introduced by Didenko, which study the energy integral argument, will be used to prove estimates for a specific Tricomi domain.</description>

      <title>Convergence of noncommutative spherical averages for actions of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the Bufetov pointwise ergodic theorem for spherical averages of even radius for free group actions on noncommutative $L\log L$-space. Indeed, we extend it to more general Orlicz space $L^\Phi(M, \tau)$ (noncommutative/classical), where $M$ is the semifinite von Neumann algebra with faithful normal semifinite trace $\tau$ and $\Phi: [0, \infty ) $ is a Orlicz function such that $ [0, \infty ) \ni t \rightarrow \left({\Phi(t)}\right)^{ \frac{1}{p}}$ is convex for some $p &gt;1$. To establish this convergence we follow similar approach as Bufetov and Anantharaman-Delaroche. Thus, additionally we obtain Rota theorem on the same noncommutative Orlicz space by extending the earlier work of Anantharaman-Delaroche. Anantharaman-Delaroche proved Rota theorem for noncommutative $L^p$-spaces for $p &gt;1$, and mentioned as ``interesting open problem'' to extend it to noncommutative $L\log L$-space as classical case. In the end we also look at the convergence of averages of spherical averages associated to free group and free semigroup actions on noncommutative spaces.</description>

      <title>Differentiation, Taylor series, and all order spectral shift functions, for relatively bounded perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $H$ self-adjoint, $V$ symmetric and relatively $H$-bounded, and $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{C}$ satisfying mild conditions, we show that the Gateaux derivative $$\frac{d^n}{dt^n}f(H+tV)|_{t=0}$$ exists in the operator norm topology, for every natural $n$, give a new explicit formula for this derivative in terms of multiple operator integrals, and establish useful perturbation formulas for multiple operator integrals under relatively bounded perturbations. Moreover, if the $H$-bound of $V$ is less than 1, we obtain sufficient conditions on $f$ which ensure that the Taylor expansion $$f(H+V)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!}\frac{d^n}{dt^n} f(H+tV)\big|_{t=0}$$ exists and converges absolutely in operator norm. Finally, assuming that $V(H-i)^{-p}\in\mathcal{S}^{s/p}$ for $p=1,\ldots,s$ for some $s\in\mathbb{N}$ (for instance, when $H$ is an order 1 differential operator on an $s-1$ dimensional space), we show that the Krein--Koplienko spectral shift functions $\eta_{k,H,V}$, satisfying $${Tr}\left(f(H+V)-\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\frac{1}{m!}\frac{d^m}{dt^m} f(H+tV)\big|_{t=0}\right)=\int_{\mathbb{R}} f^{(k)}(x)\eta_{k,H,V}(x)dx,$$ exist for every $k=1,2,3,\ldots$, independently of $s$. The latter result (which is significantly stronger than \cite{vNS22}) is completely new also in the case that $V$ is bounded. The proof is based on \cite{PSS}, combined with a generalisation of the multiple operator integral compatible with \cite{HMvN}. We discuss applications of our results to quantum physics and noncommutative geometry.</description>

      <title>On the boundedness and Schatten class property of noncommutative martingale paraproducts and operator-valued commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Schatten class membership of semicommutative martingale paraproducts and use the transference method to describe Schatten class membership of purely noncommutative martingale paraproducts, especially for CAR algebras and $\mathop{\otimes}\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{M}_{d}$ in terms of martingale Besov spaces.
  Using Hyt\"{o}nen's dyadic martingale technique, we also obtain sufficient conditions on the Schatten class membership and the boundedness of operator-valued commutators involving general singular integral operators.
  We establish the complex median method, which is applicable to complex-valued functions. We apply it to get the optimal necessary conditions on the Schatten class membership of operator-valued commutators associated with non-degenerate kernels in Hyt\"{o}nen's sense. This resolves the problem on the characterization of Schatten class membership of operator-valued commutators. Our results are new even in the scalar case.
  Our new approach is built on Hyt\"{o}nen's dyadic martingale technique and the complex median method. Compared with all the previous ones, this new one is more powerful in several aspects: $(a)$ it permits us to deal with more general singular integral operators with little smoothness; $(b)$ it allows us to deal with commutators with complex-valued kernels; $(c)$ it goes much further beyond the scalar case and can be applied to the semicommutative setting.
  By a weak-factorization type decomposition, we get some necessary but not optimal conditions on the boundedness of operator-valued commutators. In addition, we give a new proof of the boundedness of commutators still involving general singular integral operators concerning $BMO$ spaces in the commutative setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we recontextualize the theory of matrix weights within the setting of Banach lattices. We define an intrinsic notion of directional Banach function spaces, generalizing matrix weighted Lebesgue spaces. Moreover, we prove an extrapolation theorem for these spaces based on the boundedness of the convex-set valued maximal operator. We also provide bounds and equivalences related to the convex body sparse operator. Finally, we introduce a weak-type analogue of directional Banach function spaces. In particular, we show that the weak-type boundedness of the set valued maximal operator on matrix weighted Lebesgue spaces is equivalent to the matrix Muckenhoupt condition, with equivalent constants.</description>

      <title>A stronger form of Yamamoto's theorem II -- Spectral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $A \in M_m(\mathbb{C})$, Yamamoto's generalization of the spectral radius formula (1967) asserts that $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_j(A^n)^{\frac{1}{n}}$ is equal to the $j^{\textrm{th}}$-largest eigenvalue-modulus of $A$, where $s_j (A^n)$ denotes the $j^{\textrm{th}}$-largest singular value of $A^n$. Let $\mathscr{H}$ be a complex Hilbert space, and for an operator $T \in \mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$, let $|T| := (T^*T)^{\frac{1}{2}}$. For $A$ in $\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$, we refer to the sequence, $\{ |A^n|^{\frac{1}{n}} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$, as the $\textit{normalized power sequence}$ of $A$. As our main result, we prove a spatial form of Yamamoto's theorem which asserts that the normalized power sequence of a spectral operator in $\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$ converges in norm, and provide an explicit description of the limit in terms of its idempotent-valued spectral resolution. Our approach substantially generalizes the corresponding result by the first-named author in the case of matrices in $M_m(\mathbb{C})$, and supplements the Haagerup-Schultz theorem on SOT-convergence of the normalized power sequence of an operator in a $II_1$ factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a variational formulation to define a generalized notion of perimeter, from which we derive abstract isoperimetric Cheeger's inequalities via gradient estimates on solutions of Poisson equations. Our abstract framework unifies many existing results and in particular allows us to recover the $W_1-W^{1,1}$ transport inequality, which strengthens the usual transport-information inequality. Conversely, we also prove that Cheeger's inequality implies certain first order Calder{\'o}n-Zygmund-type gradient estimates.</description>

      <title>Free Stein Kernel and Moments maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a free analogue to Fathi's construction of Stein kernels using moment maps (2019). This is possible for a class of measures called free moment measures that was introduced in the free case by Bahr and Boschert (2021), and by using the notion of free moment maps which are convex functions, solutions of a variant of the free Monge-Amp\`ere equation discovered by Guionnet and Shlyakhtenko (2012). We then show how regularity estimates in some weighted non-commutative Sobolev spaces on these maps control the transport distances to the semicircular law. We also prove in the one dimensional case a free analogue of the moment map version of the Cafarelli contraction theorem (2001), discovered by Klartag in the classical case (2014), and which leads to a uniform bound on the free moment Stein kernel. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results: we prove a stability result characterizing the semicircular distribution among a certain subclass of free Gibbs measures, the probabilistic interpretation of this free moment Stein kernel in terms of free diffusion processes, its connections with the theory of non-commutative Dirichlet forms, and a possible notion of a non-commutative (free) Hessian manifold associated with a free Gibbs measure, conjecturally having free analogue properties of a classical Hessian manifold associated with a log-concave measure and considered by Kolesnikov (2012), which has the striking property of having a Ricci curvature bounded from below by $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Zero-extension convergence and Sobolev spaces on changing domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the definition of weak and strong convergence to sequences of Sobolev-functions whose underlying domains themselves are converging. In contrast to previous works, we do so without ever assuming any sort of reference configuration. We then develop the respective theory and counterparts to classical compactness theorems from the fixed domain case. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of these definitions with some examples from applications and compare them to other approaches.</description>
