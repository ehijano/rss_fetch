      <title>Cardinalities in proofreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1975, G. P\'olya pointed out that if two proofreaders found $a$, resp. $b$, errors in text, and both found $c$ errors, then the unknown number $e$ of all errors is approximated by $e\approx\frac{ab}{c}$. We devise a realistic combinatorial model of P\'olya's result and estimate its performance by the Probabilistic Method.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of two-dimensional determinantal processes associated with Berezin--Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a new class of determinantal point processes in the complex plane coming from the ground state of free fermions associated with Berezin--Toeplitz operators. These processes generalize the Ginibre ensemble from random matrix theory. We prove a two-term Szeg\H{o}-type asymptotic expansion for the Laplace transform of smooth linear statistics. This implies a law of large number and central limit theorem for the empirical field. The limiting variance includes both contributions from the bulk and boundary of the droplet. The boundary fluctuations depend on the Hamiltonian dynamics associated with the underlying operator and, generally, are not conformally invariant.</description>

      <title>Uniform asymptotics for a multidimensional renewal risk model with multivariate subexponential claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a multidimensional risk model with a common renewal process and in the presence of a constant interest force. The claim sizes are independent and identically distributed random vectors, with the distribution of dependent components belonging to the class of multivariate subexponential distributions. We establish locally uniform asymptotic estimations for the entrance probability of the discounted aggregate claims into some rare sets, and further derive asymptotic estimations uniformly over all the time horizons. Furthermore, we present some distribution examples that belong to these multivariate heavy-tailed distribution classes, which are not restricted only to the case of multivariate regular variation.</description>

      <title>Convergence to equilibrium for a class of exchange economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of stochastic dynamical models of exchange economies that we call ``fully connected Cobb-Douglas'', the paper proves convergence of the probability distribution to an equilibrium, in total variation metric as time goes to infinity. The convergence is exponential and the equilibrium is determined uniquely by the number of agents, their ``exponents'', and the initial amounts of money and goods in the economy.</description>

      <title>Quenched limit for diffusive biased random walks in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every directionally transient random walk in random i.i.d.\ environment, under condition $(T)_{\gamma}$, which admits an annealed functional limit towards Brownian motion also admits the corresponding quenched limit in $d \ge 2$. We exploit a classical strategy that was introduced by Bolthausen and Sznitman but, with respect to the existing literature, we get almost-optimal bounds on the variance of the quenched expectation of certain functionals of the random walk.</description>

      <title>On the density of singular SDEs with fractional noise and applications to McKean-Vlasov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the (conditional) law of the solution to SDEs driven by fractional Brownian noise with a singular, possibly distributional, drift. Our results on the law are twofold: i) we quantify the spatial regularity of the law, while keeping track of integrability in time, and ii) we prove that it has a density with Gaussian tails. Then the former result is used to establish novel results on existence and uniqueness of solutions to McKean-Vlasov equations of convolutional type.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for the Euler characteristic in the Random Connection Model for higher-dimensional simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generalizations of random graphs, random simplicial complexes have been receiving growing attention in the literature. In this paper, we naturally extend the Random Connection Model (RCM), a random graph that has been extensively studied for over three decades, to a random simplicial complex, recovering many models currently found in the literature as special cases. In this new model, we derive quantitative central limit theorems for a generalized Euler characteristic in various asymptotic scenarios. We will accomplish this within a very general framework, where the vertices of the simplicial complex are drawn from an arbitrary Borel space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic rotational invariance of an integration by parts formula inspired by the Bismut approach to Malliavin calculus is proved in the framework of the Lie symmetry theory of stochastic differential equations. The non-trivial effect of the rotational invariance of the driving Brownian motion in the derivation of the integration by parts formula is discussed and the invariance property of the formula is shown via applications to some explicit two-dimensional Brownian motion-driven stochastic models.</description>

      <title>Dimerization in $O(n)$-invariant quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish dimerization in $O(n)$-invariant quantum spin chains with big enough $n$, in a large part of the phase diagram where this result is expected. This includes identifying two distinct ground states which are translations of one unit of eachother, and which both have exponentially decaying correlations. Our method relies on a probabilistic representation of the quantum system in terms of random loops, and an adaptation of a method developed for loop $O(n)$ models on the hexagonal lattice by Duminil-Copin, Peled, Samotij and Spinka.</description>

      <title>Full distribution of the number of distinct sites visited by a random walker in dimension $d \ge 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P_M(S)$ of the number of distinct sites $S$ visited by a random walker on a $d$-dimensional lattice after $M$ steps. We focus on the case $d \ge 2$, and we are interested in the long-time limit $M \gg 1$. Our primary interest is the behavior of the right and left tails of $P_M(S)$, corresponding to $S$ larger and smaller than its mean value, respectively. We present theoretical arguments that predict that in the right tail, a standard large-deviation principle (LDP) $P_{M}\left(S\right)\sim e^{-M\Phi\left(S/M\right)}$ is satisfied (at $M \gg 1$) for $d\ge2$, while in the left tail, the scaling behavior is $P_{M}\left(S\right)\sim e^{-M^{1-2/d}\Psi\left(S/M\right)}$, corresponding to a LDP with anomalous scaling, for $d&gt;2$. We also obtain bounds for the scaling functions $\Phi(a)$ and $\Psi(a)$, and obtain analytical results for $\Phi(a)$ in the high-dimensional limit $d \gg 1$, and for $\Psi(a)$ in the limit $a \ll 1$ (describing the far left tail). Our predictions are validated by numerical simulations using importance sampling algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove convergence of multi-point spin correlations in the critical Ising model on a torus. Via Pfaffian identities, this also implies convergence of other correlations, including correlations of spins with fermionic and energy observables. We obtain explicit formulae for the scaling limits in terms of theta functions, verifying the predictions in the physics literature.</description>

Abstract: In this note we outline a new and simple approach to proving central limit theorems for various 'global' graph parameters which have robust 'local' approximations, using the Efron--Stein inequality, which relies on a combinatorial analysis of the stability of these approximations under resampling an edge. As an application, we give short proofs of a central limit theorem for the order of the giant component and of the $k$-core for sparse random graphs.</description>

      <title>Causal Effect Identification in Heterogeneous Environments from Higher-Order Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random experiments that are simple and clear enough to be performed by human agents feature prominently in the teaching of elementary stochastics as well as in games. We present Alea, a domain-specific language for the specification of random experiments. Alea code can either be analyzed statically to obtain and inspect probability distributions of outcomes, or be executed with a source pseudo-randomness for simulation or as a game assistant. The language is intended for ease of use by non-expert programmers, in particular students of elementary stochastics, and players and designers of games of chance, by focusing on concepts common to functional programming and basic mathematics. Both the design of the language and the implementation of runtime environments are work in progress.</description>

      <title>Learning to Integrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work deals with uncertainty quantification for a generic input distribution to some resource-intensive simulation, e.g., requiring the solution of a partial differential equation. While efficient numerical methods exist to compute integrals for high-dimensional Gaussian and other separable distributions based on sparse grids (SG), input data arising in practice often does not fall into this class. We therefore employ transport maps to transform complex distributions to multivatiate standard normals. In generative learning, a number of neural network architectures have been introduced that accomplish this task approximately. Examples are affine coupling flows (ACF) and ordinary differential equation-based networks such as conditional flow matching (CFM). To compute the expectation of a quantity of interest, we numerically integrate the composition of the inverse of the learned transport map with the simulation code output. As this map is integrated over a multivariate Gaussian distribution, SG techniques can be applied. Viewing the images of the SG quadrature nodes as learned quadrature nodes for a given complex distribution motivates our title. We demonstrate our method for monomials of total degrees for which the unmapped SG rules are exact. We also apply our approach to the stationary diffusion equation with coefficients modeled by exponentiated L\'evy random fields, using a Karhunen-Lo\`eve-like modal expansions with 9 and 25 modes. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate errors due to learning accuracy, quadrature, statistical estimation, truncation of the modal series of the input random field, and training data size for three normalizing flows (ACF, conditional Flow Matching and Optimal transport Flow Matching) We discuss the mathematical assumptions on which our approach is based and demonstrate its shortcomings when these are violated.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional queue-reactive model and signal-driven models: a unified framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Markovian market model driven by a hidden Brownian efficient price. In particular, we extend the queue-reactive model, making its dynamics dependent on the efficient price. Our study focuses on two sub-models: a signal-driven price model where the mid-price jump rates depend on the efficient price and an observable signal, and the usual queue-reactive model dependent on the efficient price via the intensities of the order arrivals. This way, we are able to correlate the evolution of limit order books of different stocks. We prove the stability of the observed mid-price around the efficient price under natural assumptions. Precisely, we show that at the macroscopic scale, prices behave as diffusions. We also develop a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the model, and test it numerically. Our model is them used to backest trading strategies in a liquidation context.</description>

      <title>Intertwining diffusions and wave equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:1306.0857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of intertwined diffusion processes of any dimension. Our main result gives an SDE construction of intertwinings of diffusion processes and shows that they correspond to nonnegative solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations. For example, solutions of the classical wave equation correspond to the intertwinings of two Brownian motions. The theory allows us to unify many older examples of intertwinings, such as the process extension of the beta-gamma algebra, with more recent examples such as the ones arising in the study of two-dimensional growth models. We also find many new classes of intertwinings and develop systematic procedures for building more complex intertwinings by combining simpler ones. In particular, `orthogonal waves' combine unidimensional intertwinings to produce multidimensional ones. Connections with duality, time reversals and Doob's h-transforms are also explored.</description>

Abstract: We show that the small-time asymptotics of the sub-Riemannian heat kernel, its derivatives, and its logarithmic derivatives can be localized, allowing them to be studied even on incomplete manifolds, under essentially optimal conditions on the distance to infinity. Continuing, away from abnormal minimizers, we show that the asymptotics are closely connected to the structure of the minimizing geodesics between the two relevant points (which is non-trivial on the cut locus). This gives uniform heat kernel bounds on compacts, and also allows a complete expansion of the heat kernel, and its derivatives, in a wide variety of cases.
  The method extends naturally to logarithmic derivatives of the heat kernel, where we again get uniform bounds on compacts and a more precise expansion for any particular pair of points, in most cases. In particular, we determine the measure giving the law of large numbers for the corresponding diffusion bridge, and the leading terms of the logarithmic derivatives are given by the cumulants of geometrically natural random variables with respect to this measure. One consequence is that the non-abnormal cut locus is characterized by the behavior of the log-Hessian of the heat kernel.</description>

      <title>Determinantal random subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define two families of determinantal random spanning subgraphs of a finite connected graph, one supported by acyclic spanning subgraphs (spanning forests) with fixed number of connected components, the other by connected spanning subgraphs with fixed number of independent cycles. Each family generalizes the uniform spanning tree and the generating functions of these probability measures generalize the classical Kirchhoff and Symanzik polynomials.
  We call Symanzik spanning forests the elements of the acyclic spanning subgraphs family, and single out a particular determinantal mixture of these, having as kernel a normalized Laplacian on $1$-forms, which we call the Laplacian spanning forest.
  Our proofs rely on a set of integral and real or complex (which we call geometric) multilinear identies involving cycles, coboundaries, and forests on graphs. We prove these identities using classical pieces of the algebraic topology of graphs and the exterior calculus applied to finite determinantal point processes, both of which we treat in a self-contained way.
  We emphasize the matroidal nature of our constructions, thereby showing how the above two families of random spanning subgraphs are dual to one another, as well as possible generalisations.</description>

      <title>Distances on the $\mathrm{CLE}_4$, critical Liouville quantum gravity and $3/2$-stable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08571v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is threefold. First, we show that when one explores a conformal loop ensemble of parameter $\kappa=4$ ($\mathrm{CLE}_4$) on an independent $2$-Liouville quantum gravity ($2$-LQG) disk, the surfaces which are cut out are independent quantum disks. To achieve this, we rely on approximations of the explorations of a $\mathrm{CLE}_4$: we first approximate the $\mathrm{SLE}_4^{\langle \mu \rangle}(-2)$ explorations for $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ using explorations of the $\mathrm{CLE}_\kappa$ as $\kappa \uparrow 4$ and then we approximate the uniform exploration by letting $\mu \to \infty$. Second, we describe the relation between the so-called natural quantum distance and the conformally invariant distance to the boundary introduced by Werner and Wu. Third, we establish the scaling limit of the distances from the boundary to the large faces of $3/2$-stable maps and relate the limit to the $\mathrm{CLE}_4$-decorated $2$-LQG.</description>

      <title>Spectral Criteria for the Asymptotics of Local Functionals of Gaussian Fields and Their Application to Nodal Volumes and Critical Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a general criterion for the positivity of the variance of a chaotic component of local functionals of stationary vector-valued Gaussian fields. This criterion is formulated in terms of the spectral properties of the covariance function, without requiring integrability or isotropy. It offers a simple and robust framework for analyzing variance asymptotics in such models. We apply this approach to the study of the nodal volume and the number of critical points of a Gaussian field, proving the positivity of the limiting variance under mild conditions on the covariance function. Additionally, we examine the asymptotics of nodal volume and critical points of Euclidean random waves, deriving the central limit theorem through an analysis of the second and fourth chaotic components. As a byproduct, we unify and generalize many existing results on the volume of intersections of random waves and their critical points, bypassing the need for traditional, intricate variance computations. Our findings shed new light on the second-chaos cancellation phenomenon from a spectral perspective and can be extended to any local, possibly singular, functional of Gaussian fields.</description>

      <title>Stationary distribution of node2vec random walks on household models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The node2vec random walk has proven to be a key tool in network embedding algorithms. These random walks are tuneable, and their transition probabilities depend on the previous visited node and on the triangles containing the current and the previously visited node. Even though these walks are widely used in practice, most mathematical properties of node2vec walks are largely unexplored, including their stationary distribution. We study the node2vec random walk on community-structured household model graphs. We prove an explicit description of the stationary distribution of node2vec walks in terms of the walk parameters. We then show that by tuning the walk parameters, the stationary distribution can interpolate between uniform, size-biased, or the simple random walk stationary distributions, demonstrating the wide range of possible walks. We further explore these effects on some specific graph settings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Product-form Steady-state Distribution for Semimartingale Reflecting Brownian Motion in Multi-scaling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Dai et al. [2023], we develop a novel multi-scaling asymptotic regime for semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM). In this regime, we establish the steady-state convergence of SRBM to a product-form limit with exponentially distributed components by assuming the P-reflection matrix and a uniform moment bound condition. We further demonstrate that the uniform moment bound condition holds in several subclasses of P-matrices. Our proof approach is rooted in the basic adjoint relationship (BAR) for SRBM proposed by Harrison and Williams [1987a].</description>

      <title>Quantification of limit theorems for Hawkes processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we fill a gap in the literature regarding quantitative functional central limit theorems (qfCLT) for Hawkes processes by providing an upper bound for the convergence of a nearly unstable Hawkes process toward a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process. Note that in this case no speed of convergence has been established even for one-dimensional marginals; we provide in this paper a control in terms of a supremum norm in $2$-Wasserstein distance. To do so, we make use of the so-called Poisson imbedding representation and provide a qfCLT formulation in terms of a Brownian sheet. Incidentally, we construct an optimal coupling between a rescaled bi-dimensional Poisson random measure and a Brownian sheet with respect to the $2$-Wasserstein distance and analyze the asymptotic quality of this coupling in detail.</description>

      <title>Expanded regimes of area law for lattice Yang-Mills theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the parameter regimes for which area law is proven for pure $\mathrm{U}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills theories, in particular when $N$ is large. This improves on a classical result of Osterwalder-Seiler from 1978. To do so, we view the master loop equation as a linear inhomogeneous equation for Wilson string expectations, and then prove an a priori bound for solutions to the equation. The main novelty is in how we deal with the merger term in the master loop equation. This is done by introducing a truncated model for which the merger term is unproblematic, and then showing that the truncated model well approximates the original model.</description>

      <title>A new approach to principal-agent problems with volatility control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent work by Cvitani\'c, Possama\"i, and Touzi (2018) [9] presents a general approach for continuous-time principal-agent problems, through dynamic programming and second-order backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). In this paper, we provide an alternative formulation of the principal-agent problem, which can be solved simply by relying on the theory of BSDEs. This reformulation is strongly inspired by an important remark in [9], namely that if the principal observes the output process in continuous-time, she can compute its quadratic variation pathwise. While in [9], this information is used in the contract, our reformulation consists in assuming that the principal could directly control this process, in a `first-best' fashion. The resolution approach for this alternative problem actually follows the line of the so-called `Sannikov's trick' in the literature on continuous-time principal-agent problems, as originally introduced by Sannikov (2008) [28]. We then show that the solution to this `first-best' formulation is identical to the solution of the original problem. More precisely, using the contract form introduced in [9] as `penalisation contracts', we highlight that this `first-best' scenario can be achieved even if the principal cannot directly control the quadratic variation. Nevertheless, we do not have to rely on the theory of 2BSDEs to prove that such contracts are optimal, as their optimality is ensured by showing that the `first-best' scenario is achieved. We believe that this more straightforward approach to solve continuous-time principal-agent problems with volatility control will facilitate the dissemination of these problems across many fields, and its extension to even more intricate problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetrically self-similar graphs are an important type of fractal graph. Their Green functions satisfy order one iterative functional equations. We show when the branching number of a generating cell is two, either the graph is a star consisting of finitely many one-sided lines meeting at an origin vertex, in which case the Green function is algebraic, or the Green function is differentially transcendental over $\mathbb{C}(z)$. The proof strategy relies on a recent work of Di Vizio, Fernandes and Mishna. The result adds evidence to a conjecture of Kr\"on and Teufl about the spectrum of this family of graphs.</description>

      <title>Approximating the total variation distance between spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin systems form an important class of undirected graphical models. For two Gibbs distributions $\mu$ and $\nu$ induced by two spin systems on the same graph $G = (V, E)$, we study the problem of approximating the total variation distance $d_{TV}(\mu,\nu)$ with an $\epsilon$-relative error. We propose a new reduction that connects the problem of approximating the TV-distance to sampling and approximate counting. Our applications include the hardcore model and the antiferromagnetic Ising model in the uniqueness regime, the ferromagnetic Ising model, and the general Ising model satisfying the spectral condition.
  Additionally, we explore the computational complexity of approximating the total variation distance $d_{TV}(\mu_S,\nu_S)$ between two marginal distributions on an arbitrary subset $S \subseteq V$. We prove that this problem remains hard even when both $\mu$ and $\nu$ admit polynomial-time sampling and approximate counting algorithms.</description>
