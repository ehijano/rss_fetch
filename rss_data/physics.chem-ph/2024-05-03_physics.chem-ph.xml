      <title>Molecular Insights into the Water Dissociation and Proton Dynamics at the $\beta$-TaON (100)/Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of the semiconductor-water interface is crucial for developing efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting catalysts, as it governs reactivity through charge and mass transport. In this study, we employ ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural and dynamical properties of water at the $\beta$-TaON (100) surface. We observed that a well-defined interface is established through the spontaneous dissociation of water and the reorganization of surface chemical bonds. This leads to the formation of a partially hydroxylated surface, accompanied by a strong network of hydrogen bonds at the TaON-water interface. Consequently, various proton transport routes, including the proton transfer through "low-barrier hydrogen bond" path, become active across the interface, dramatically increasing the overall rate of the proton hopping at the interface. Based on our findings, we propose that the observed high photocatalytic activity of TaON-based semiconductors could be attributed to the spontaneous water dissociation and the resulting high proton transfer rate at the interface.</description>

      <title>High repetition rate ultrafast electron diffraction with direct electron detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) instruments typically operate at kHz or lower repetition rates and rely on indirect detection of electrons. However, these experiments encounter limitations because they are required to use electron beams containing a relatively large number of electrons (&gt;&gt;100 electrons/pulse), leading to severe space-charge effects. Consequently, electron pulses with long durations and large transverse diameters are used to interrogate the sample. Here, we introduce a novel UED instrument operating at a high repetition rate and employing direct electron detection. We operate significantly below the severe space-charge regime by using electron beams containing 55 to 140 electrons per pulse at 30-kHz. We demonstrate the ability to detect time-resolved signals from thin film solid samples with a difference contrast signal, {\Delta}I/I0, and an instrument response function as low as 10-5 and 243-fs (FWHM), respectively, without temporal compression. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of increasing the repetition rate of UED experiments and adopting a direct electron detection scheme. Our newly developed scheme enables more efficient and sensitive investigations of ultrafast dynamics in photoexcited samples using ultrashort electron beams.</description>

      <title>High-frequency tails in spectral densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in numerically exact quantum dynamics methods have brought the dream of calculating the dynamics of chemically complex open systems closer to reality. Path-integral-based methods, hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) and quantum analog simulators all require the spectral density of the environment to describe its effect on the system. Here we find that the rate of slow population relaxation is sensitive to the precise functional form used to describe the spectral density peaks. This finding highlights yet another challenge to obtaining accurate spectral densities. In the context of quantum information science, we give a simple recipe to adjust the results of analog simulation for this difference assuming both the simulator and the target spectral densities are known.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking DFT-based excited-state methods for intermolecular charge-transfer excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermolecular charge-transfer is a highly important process in biology and energy-conversion applications where generated charges need to be transported over several moieties. However, its theoretical description is challenging since the high accuracy required to describe these excited states must be accessible for calculations on large molecular systems. In this benchmark study, we identify reliable low-scaling computational methods for this task. Our reference results were obtained from highly accurate wavefunction calculations that restrict the size of the benchmark systems. However, the density-functional theory based methods that we identify as accurate can be applied to much larger systems. Since targeting charge-transfer states requires the unambiguous classification of an excited state, we first analyze several charge-transfer descriptors for their reliability concerning intermolecular charge-transfer and single out DCT as an optimal choice for our purposes. In general, best results are obtained for orbital-optimized methods - and among those, IMOM proved to be the most numerically stable variant - but optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functionals combined with rather small basis sets proved to yield surprisingly good results. This makes these fast calculations attractive for high-throughput screening applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable Ab Initio Electronic Structure Methods with Near Chemical Accuracy for Main Group Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the precision of widely recognized quantum chemical methodologies, CCSD(T), DLPNO-CCSD(T) and localized ph-AFQMC, for determining the thermochemistry of main group elements. DLPNO-CCSD(T) and localized ph-AFQMC, which offer greater scalability compared to canonical CCSD(T), have emerged over the last decade as pivotal in producing precise benchmark chemical data. Our investigation includes closed-shell, neutral molecules, focusing on their heat of formation and atomization energy sourced from four specific small molecule datasets. Firstly, we selected molecules from the G2 and G3 datasets, noted for their reliable experimental heat of formation data. Additionally, we incorporate molecules from the W4-11 and W4-17 sets, which provide high-level theoretical reference values for atomization energy at 0 K. Our findings reveal that both DLPNO-CCSD(T) and ph-AFQMC methods are capable of achieving a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of less than 1 kcal/mol across the combined dataset, aligning with the threshold for chemical accuracy. Moreover, we make efforts to confine the maximum deviations within 2 kcal/mol, a degree of precision that significantly broadens the applicability of these methods in fields such as biology and materials science.</description>

      <title>FeNNol: an Efficient and Flexible Library for Building Force-field-enhanced Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network interatomic potentials (NNPs) have recently proven to be powerful tools to accurately model complex molecular systems while bypassing the high numerical cost of ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. In recent years, numerous advances in model architectures as well as the development of hybrid models combining machine-learning (ML) with more traditional, physically-motivated, force-field interactions have considerably increased the design space of ML potentials. In this paper, we present FeNNol, a new library for building, training and running force-field-enhanced neural network potentials. It provides a flexible and modular system for building hybrid models, allowing to easily combine state-of-the-art embeddings with ML-parameterized physical interaction terms without the need for explicit programming. Furthermore, FeNNol leverages the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation features of the Jax Python library to enable fast evaluation of NNPs, shrinking the performance gap between ML potentials and standard force-fields. This is demonstrated with the popular ANI-2x model reaching simulation speeds nearly on par with the AMOEBA polarizable force-field on commodity GPUs (GPU=Graphics processing unit). We hope that FeNNol will facilitate the development and application of new hybrid NNP architectures for a wide range of molecular simulation problems.</description>

      <title>Implementation of time-dependent Hartree Fock in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) is one of the fundamental post-Hartree-Fock (HF) methods to describe excited states. In its Tamm-Dancoff form, equivalent to Configuration Interaction Singles, it is still widely used and particularly applicable to big molecules where more accurate methods may be unfeasibly expensive. However, it is rarely implemented in real space, mostly because of the expensive nature of the exact-exchange potential in real space. Compared to widely used Gaussian-type orbitals (GTO) basis sets, real space often offers easier implementation of equations and more systematic convergence of Rydberg states, as well as favorable scaling, effective domain parallelization, flexible boundary conditions, and ability to treat model systems. We implemented TDHF in the Octopus real-space code as a step toward linear-response hybrid time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), other post-HF methods, and ensemble density-functional theory methods involving exact exchange. Calculation of HF's non-local exact exchange is very expensive in real space. We overcome this limitation with Octopus' implementation of Adaptively Compressed Exchange (ACE), and find the appropriate mixing and starting point to complete the ground-state calculation in a practical amount of time, to enable TDHF. We compared our results to those from GTOs on a set of small molecules and confirmed close agreement of results, though with larger deviations than in the case of semi-local TDDFT. We find that convergence of TDHF demands a finer real-space grid than semi-local TDDFT. We also present the subtleties in benchmarking a real-space calculation against GTOs, relating to Rydberg and vacuum states.</description>

      <title>Formation of extraterrestrial peptides and their derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of protein precursors, due to the condensation of atomic carbon under the low-temperature conditions of the molecular phases of the interstellar medium, opens alternative pathways for the origin of life. We perform peptide synthesis under conditions prevailing in space and provide a comprehensive analytic characterization of its products. The application of 13C allowed us to confirm the suggested pathway of peptide formation that proceeds due to the polymerization of aminoketene molecules that are formed in the C + CO + NH3 reaction. Here, we address the question of how the efficiency of peptide production is modified by the presence of water molecules. We demonstrate that although water slightly reduces the efficiency of polymerization of aminoketene, it does not prevent the formation of peptides.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of twist-dependent electron transfer rate in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular simulation and continuum dielectric theory, we consider how electrochemical kinetics are modulated as a function of twist angle in bilayer graphene electrodes. By establishing an effective connection between twist angle and the screening length of charge carriers within the electrode, we investigate how tunable metallicity can result in modified statistics of the electron transfer energy gap. Constant potential molecular simulations show that the activation free energy for electron transfer is an increasing function of the screening length, or decreasing function the density of states at the Fermi energy in the electrode, and subsequently a non-monotonic function of twist angle. We find the twist angle alters the density of states, which tunes the number of thermally-accessible channels for electron transfer, as well as the reorganization energy by altering the stability of the vertically excited state through attenuated image charge interactions. Understanding these effects allows us to cast the Marcus rate of interfacial electron transfer as a function of twist angle, in a manner consistent with a growing body of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>The Role of Model Architecture and Scale in Predicting Molecular Properties: Insights from Fine-Tuning RoBERTa, BART, and LLaMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a systematic framework to compare the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) for fine-tuning across various cheminformatics tasks. Employing a uniform training methodology, we assessed three well-known models-RoBERTa, BART, and LLaMA-on their ability to predict molecular properties using the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) as a universal molecular representation format. Our comparative analysis involved pre-training 18 configurations of these models, with varying parameter sizes and dataset scales, followed by fine-tuning them on six benchmarking tasks from DeepChem. We maintained consistent training environments across models to ensure reliable comparisons. This approach allowed us to assess the influence of model type, size, and training dataset size on model performance. Specifically, we found that LLaMA-based models generally offered the lowest validation loss, suggesting their superior adaptability across tasks and scales. However, we observed that absolute validation loss is not a definitive indicator of model performance - contradicts previous research - at least for fine-tuning tasks: instead, model size plays a crucial role. Through rigorous replication and validation, involving multiple training and fine-tuning cycles, our study not only delineates the strengths and limitations of each model type but also provides a robust methodology for selecting the most suitable LLM for specific cheminformatics applications. This research underscores the importance of considering model architecture and dataset characteristics in deploying AI for molecular property prediction, paving the way for more informed and effective utilization of AI in drug discovery and related fields.</description>

      <title>CACTUS: Chemistry Agent Connecting Tool-Usage to Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various domains, but they often lack the ability to access and reason over domain-specific knowledge and tools. In this paper, we introduced CACTUS (Chemistry Agent Connecting Tool-Usage to Science), an LLM-based agent that integrates cheminformatics tools to enable advanced reasoning and problem-solving in chemistry and molecular discovery. We evaluate the performance of CACTUS using a diverse set of open-source LLMs, including Gemma-7b, Falcon-7b, MPT-7b, Llama2-7b, and Mistral-7b, on a benchmark of thousands of chemistry questions. Our results demonstrate that CACTUS significantly outperforms baseline LLMs, with the Gemma-7b and Mistral-7b models achieving the highest accuracy regardless of the prompting strategy used. Moreover, we explore the impact of domain-specific prompting and hardware configurations on model performance, highlighting the importance of prompt engineering and the potential for deploying smaller models on consumer-grade hardware without significant loss in accuracy. By combining the cognitive capabilities of open-source LLMs with domain-specific tools, CACTUS can assist researchers in tasks such as molecular property prediction, similarity searching, and drug-likeness assessment. Furthermore, CACTUS represents a significant milestone in the field of cheminformatics, offering an adaptable tool for researchers engaged in chemistry and molecular discovery. By integrating the strengths of open-source LLMs with domain-specific tools, CACTUS has the potential to accelerate scientific advancement and unlock new frontiers in the exploration of novel, effective, and safe therapeutic candidates, catalysts, and materials. Moreover, CACTUS's ability to integrate with automated experimentation platforms and make data-driven decisions in real time opens up new possibilities for autonomous discovery.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised identification of local atomic environment from atomistic potential descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing local structures effectively is key to unraveling the origin of many physical phenomena. Unsupervised algorithms offer an effective way of handling systems in which order parameters are unknown or computationally expensive. By combining novel unsupervised algorithm (Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection) with atomistic potential descriptors, we distinguish between various chemical environments with minimal computational overhead. In particular, we apply this method to silicon and water systems. The algorithm effectively distinguishes between solid structures and phases of silicon, including solid and liquid phases, and accurately identifies interstitial, monovacancy, and surface atoms in diamond structures. In the case of water, it is capable of identifying an ice nucleus in the liquid phase, demonstrating its applicability in nucleation studies.</description>

      <title>The rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal and confirmation of its detection toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3-Hydroxypropenal (HOCHCHCHO) is the lower energy tautomer of malonaldehyde which displays a complex rotation-tunneling spectrum. It was detected tentatively toward the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293$-$2422 B with ALMA in the framework of the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS). Several transitions, however, had large residuals, preventing not only their detection, but also the excitation temperature of the species from being determined unambiguously. We want to extend the existing rotational line list of 3-hydroxypropenal to shed more light on the recent observational results and to facilitate additional radio astronomical searches for this molecule. We analyzed the rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal in the frequency regions between 150 and 330 GHz and between 400 and 660 GHz. Transitions were searched for in the PILS observations of IRAS 16293$-$2422. Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models were carried out and compared to the observations to constrain the excitation temperature. Additional transitions were searched for in other ALMA archival data of the same source to confirm the presence of 3-hydroxypropenal. More than 11500 transitions were assigned in the course of our investigation with quantum numbers $2 \le J \le 100$, $K_a \le 59$, and $K_c \le 97$, resulting in a greatly improved set of spectroscopic parameters. The comparison between the LTE models and the observations yields an excitation temperature of 125 K with a column density $N = 1.0 \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for this species. We identified seven additional lines of 3-hydroxypropenal that show a good agreement with the model in the ALMA archive data. The calculated rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal has sufficient accuracy for radio astronomical searches. The detection of 3-hydroxypropenal toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B is now secure.</description>

      <title>A Formulation of Quantum Fluid Mechanics and Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formalism of classical mechanics is given for time-dependent many-body states of quantum mechanics, describing both fluid flow and point mass trajectories. The familiar equations of energy, motion, and those of Lagrangian mechanics are obtained. An energy and continuity equation is demonstrated to be equivalent to the real and imaginary parts of the time dependent Schroedinger equation, respectively, where the Schroedinger equation is in density matrix form. For certain stationary states, using Lagrangian mechanics and a Hamiltonian function for quantum mechanics, equations for point-mass trajectories are obtained. For 1-body states and fluid flows, the energy equation and equations of motion are the Bernoulli and Euler equations of fluid mechanics, respectively. Generalizations of the energy and Euler equations are derived to obtain equations that are in the same form as they are in classical mechanics. The fluid flow type is compressible, inviscid, irrotational, with the nonclassical element of local variable mass. Over all space mass is conserved. The variable mass is a necessary condition for the fluid flow to agree with the zero orbital angular momentum for s states of hydrogen. Cross flows are examined, where velocity directions are changed without changing the kinetic energy. For one-electron atoms, the velocity modification gives closed orbits for trajectories, and mass conservation, vortexes, and density stratification for fluid flows. For many body states, Under certain conditions, and by hypotheses, Euler equations of orbital-flows are obtained. One-body Schroedinger equations that are a generalization of the Hartree-Fock equations are also obtained. These equations contain a quantum Coulomb's law, involving the 2-body pair function of reduced density matrix theory that replace the charge densities.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Equations for Nonempirical Tight Binding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new reference state for density functional theory, termed the independent atom ansatz, is introduced in this work. This ansatz allows for the exact representation of electron density in terms of non-interacting, atom-localized orbitals. Self-consistent equations for localized states are derived. Total energy functional is found to closely resemble tight binding theory. The independent atom ansatz facilitates partial cancellation of inter-atomic electron-electron and electron-nuclear interactions, which allows for the derivation of analytical Hamiltonian matrix elements in a weak interaction limit. The formalism provides charge and energy decomposition analyses at no additional cost. It also includes mechanisms to remove self-interaction and static correlation errors. Initial numerical results for simple model systems have been previously reported [Mironenko, J. Phys. Chem. A 127, 7836 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Modeling surface vibrations and their role in molecular adsorption: a generalized Langevin approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic vibrations of a solid surface can play a significant role in the reactions of surface-bound molecules, as well as their adsorption and desorption. Relevant phonon modes can involve the collective motion of atoms over a wide array of length scales. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how the generalized Langevin equation can be utilized to describe these collective motions weighted by their coupling to individual sites. Our approach builds upon the generalized Langevin oscillator (GLO) model originally developed by Tully \textit{et al.} We extend the GLO by deriving parameters from atomistic simulation data. We apply this approach to study the memory kernel of a model platinum surface and demonstrate that the memory kernel has a bimodal form due to coupling to both low-energy acoustic modes and high-energy modes near the Debye frequency. The same bimodal form was observed across a wide variety of solids of different elemental compositions, surface structures, and solvation states. By studying how these dominant modes depend on simulation size, we argue that the acoustic modes are frozen in the limit of macroscopic lattices. By simulating periodically replicated slabs of various sizes we quantify the influence of phonon confinement effects in the memory kernel and their concomitant effect on simulated sticking coefficients.</description>

      <title>A theory of phonon induced friction on molecular adsorbates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we provide a general theory for how surface phonons couple to molecular adsorbates. Our theory maps the extended dynamics of a surface's atomic vibrational motions to a generalized Langevin equation, and by doing so captures these dynamics in a single quantity: the non-Markovian friction. The different frequency components of this friction are the phonon modes of the surface slab weighted by their coupling to the adsorbate degrees of freedom. Using this formalism, we demonstrate that physisorbed species couple primarily to acoustic phonons while chemisorbed species couple to dispersionless local vibrations. We subsequently derive equations for phonon-adjusted reaction rates using transition state theory and demonstrate that these corrections improve agreement with experimental results for CO desorption rates from Pt(111).</description>

      <title>A general framework for active space embedding methods: applications in quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a general framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing of molecular and periodic embedding approaches based on an orbital space separation of the fragment and environment degrees of freedom. We demonstrate its potential by presenting a specific implementation of periodic range-separated DFT coupled to a quantum circuit ansatz, whereby the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum equation-of-motion algorithm are used to obtain the low-lying spectrum of the embedded fragment Hamiltonian. Application of this scheme to study localized electronic states in materials is showcased through the accurate prediction of the optical properties of the neutral oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide (MgO). Despite some discrepancies in the position of the main absorption band, the method demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ab initio approaches, particularly evidenced by the excellent agreement with the experimental photoluminescence emission peak.</description>

      <title>Linear combinations of cluster mean-field states applied to spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an innovative cluster-based method employing linear combinations of diverse cluster mean-field (cMF) states, and apply it to describe the ground state of strongly-correlated spin systems. In cluster mean-field theory, the ground state wavefunction is expressed as a factorized tensor product of optimized cluster states. While our prior work concentrated on a single cMF tiling, this study removes that constraint by combining different tilings of cMF states. Selection criteria, including translational symmetry and spatial proximity, guide this process. We present benchmark calculations for the one- and two-dimensional $J_1-J_2$ and $XXZ$ Heisenberg models. Our findings highlight two key aspects. First, the method offers a semi-quantitative description of the $0.4 \lessapprox J_2/J_1 \lessapprox 0.6$ regime of the $J_1-J_2$ model - a particularly challenging regime for existing methods. Second, our results demonstrate the capability of our method to provide qualitative descriptions for all the models and regimes considered, establishing it as a valuable reference. However, the inclusion of additional (weak) correlations is necessary for quantitative agreement, and we explore methods to incorporate these extra correlations.</description>

      <title>Rapidly convergent quantum Monte Carlo using a Chebyshev projector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-reference coupled-cluster Monte Carlo (MR-CCMC) algorithm is a determinant-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm that is conceptually similar to Full Configuration Interaction QMC (FCIQMC). It has been shown to offer a balanced treatment of both static and dynamic correlation while retaining polynomial scaling, although application to large systems with significant strong correlation remained impractical. In this paper, we document recent algorithmic advances that enable rapid convergence and a more black-box approach to the multi-reference problem. These include a logarithmically scaling metric-tree based excitation acceptance algorithm to search for determinants connected to the reference space at the desired excitation level and a symmetry-screening procedure for the reference space. We show that, for moderately sized reference spaces, the new search algorithm brings about an approximately 8-fold acceleration of one MR-CCMC iteration, while the symmetry screening procedure reduces the number of active reference space determinants at essentially no loss of accuracy. We also introduce a stochastic implementation of an approximate wall projector, which is the infinite imaginary time limit of the exponential projector, using a truncated expansion of the wall function in Chebyshev polynomials. Notably, this wall-Chebyshev projector can be used to accelerate any projector-based QMC algorithm. We show that it requires significantly fewer applications of the Hamiltonian to achieve the same statistical convergence. We benchmark these acceleration methods on the beryllium and carbon dimers, using initiator FCIQMC and MR-CCMC with basis sets up to cc-pVQZ quality.</description>
