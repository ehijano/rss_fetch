      <title>Global well-posedness, scattering and blow-up for the energy-critical, Schr\"odinger equation with indefinite potential in the radial case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness theory and the scattering asymptotics for the energy-critical, Schr\"odinger equation with indefinite potential \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l} i \partial_t u+\Delta u-V(x)u +|u|^{\frac{4}{N-2}}u=0,\ (x, t) \in \mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}, \\ \left.u\right|_{t=0}=u_0 \in H ^1(\mathbb{R}^N), \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where $V(x):\mathbb{R}^N\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is indefinite and satisfies appropriate conditions. Using contraction mapping method and concentration compactness argument, we obtain the well-posedness theory in proper function spaces and scattering asymptotics. Moreover, we get a positive ground state solution which is radially symmetric by using variational methods. This paper extends the results of \cite{KCEMF2006}(Invent. Math) to the potential equation and develops the recent conclusions.</description>

      <title>Relaxation in Sobolev spaces and $L^1$ spectral gap of the 1D dissipative Boltzmann equation with Maxwell interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamic relaxation to equilibrium of the 1D dissipative Boltzmann equation with Maxwell interactions in classical $H^s$ Sobolev spaces. In addition, we present a spectral shrinkage analysis and spectral gap estimates for the linearised 1D dissipative Boltzmann operator with such interactions. Based on this study, we explore the convergence in $H^s$ and $L^{1}$ spaces for the linear and nonlinear models. This study extends classical results found in the literature given for spaces with weak topologies.</description>

      <title>On differential operators and linear differential equations on torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider periodic boundary value problems for differential equations whose coefficients are trigonometric polynomials. We construct the spaces of generalized functions, where such problems have solutions. In particular, the solvability space of a periodic analogue of the Mizohata equation is constructed. We build also a periodic analogue and a generalization of the construction of the nonstandard analysis, where infinitely smalls are not only functions, but also functional spaces.
  To show that not all constructions on the torus lead to a simplification in compare with the plane, we consider a periodic analogue of the hypoelliptic differential operator and show that its number-theoretic properties are significant. In particular, it turns out that if a polynomial with integer coefficients is irreducible in the rational field, then the corresponding differential operator is hypoelliptic on the torus.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for quasi-periodic functions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show Strichartz estimates for quasi-periodic functions with decaying Fourier coefficients via $\ell^2$-decoupling. When we additionally average in time, further improvements can be obtained. Next, we apply multilinear refinements to show low regularity local well-posedness for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. For the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation the approach yields the sharp local well-posedness result.</description>

      <title>The Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations on the Multi-Connected Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations on k-connected domains under Navier-slip boundary conditions. We study the multi-solvability of the stationary systems on general domains, which is closely related with the Cauchy-Riemann systems and critical points of harmonic functions on the domain. Then based on the structure of Green's functions, the commutator estimates are obtained on the circular domains and extended to general domains with the help of conformal mappings. Moreover, we will utilize these assertions to discuss the global well-posedness and large time behaviours of the non-stationary systems on general domains with large initial values containing vacuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, when the magnitude of the Mach number is strictly between some fixed small enough constant and $\sqrt{2}$, we can prove the linear and nonlinear ill-posedness of the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem for compressible ideal fluids. To our best knowledge, this is the first reslult that proves the nonlinear ill-posedness to the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem for the compressible Euler fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a semi-Riemannian manifold $(M,\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_g),$ we use the transnormal functions defined on $M$ to reduce fully nonlinear first order PDEs of the form \[ F(x,u,\langle \nabla_g u, \nabla_g u \rangle_g) = 0,\qquad \text{on }M \] into ODEs and obtain local existence results of solutions which are constant along the level sets of the transnormal functions. In particular, we apply this reduction method to obtain new solutions to eikonal equations with a prescribed geometry.</description>

      <title>Separation property and asymptotic behavior for a transmission problem of the bulk-surface coupled Cahn-Hilliard system with singular potentials and its Robin approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of bulk-surface coupled Cahn-Hilliard systems in a smooth, bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ $(d\in\{2,3\})$, where the trace value of the bulk phase variable is connected to the surface phase variable via a Dirichlet boundary condition or its Robin approximation. For a general class of singular potentials (including the physically relevant logarithmic potential), we establish the regularity propagation of global weak solutions to the initial boundary value problem. In particular, when the spatial dimension is two, we prove the instantaneous strict separation property, which ensures that every global weak solution remains uniformly away from the pure states $\pm 1$ after any given positive time. In the three-dimensional case, we obtain the eventual strict separation property that holds for sufficiently large time. This strict separation property allows us to prove that every global weak solution converges to a single equilibrium as time goes to infinity using the {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon approach. Finally, we study the double obstacle limit for the problem with logarithmic potentials in the bulk and on the boundary, showing that as the absolute temperature $\Theta$ tends to zero, the corresponding weak solutions converge (for a suitable subsequence) to a weak solution of the problem with a double obstacle potential.</description>

Abstract: We introduce three representative topics in semi-classical analysis. Starting from the correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics, basic semi-classical analysis tools and results are presented. The three topics are investigated in the light of the introduced techniques allowing one to emphasize different aspects of semi-classical analysis.</description>

      <title>Positive temperature in nonlinear thermoviscoelasticity and the derivation of linearized models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Nernst theorem or, equivalently, the third law of thermodynamics, the absolute zero temperature is not attainable. Starting with an initial positive temperature, we show that there exist solutions to a Kelvin-Voigt model for quasi-static nonlinear thermoviscoelasticity at a finite-strain setting [Mielke-Roub\'i\v{c}ek '20], obeying an exponential-in-time lower bound on the temperature. Afterwards, we focus on the case of deformations near the identity and temperatures near a critical positive temperature, and we show that weak solutions of the nonlinear system converge in a suitable sense to solutions of a system in linearized thermoviscoelasticity. Our result extends the recent linearization result in [Badal-Friedrich-Kru\v{z}\'ik '23], as it allows the critical temperature to be positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a critical Grushin-type problem, which is closely related to the prescribed Webster scalar curvature problems on the CR sphere with cylindrically symmetric curvature. We first prove a non-degeneracy result through local Pohozaev identities, then by using the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction methods, we construct new type of multi-bubbling solutions with cylindrical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Polarized Light and Temperature with a Refractive Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we propose a numerical algorithm to compute the intensity and polarization of a polychromatic electromagnetic radiation crossing a medium with graded refractive index and modeled by the Vector Radiative Refractive Transfer Equations (VRRTE). Special attention is given to the case where the refractive index has a discontinuity for which the Fresnel conditions are necessary. We assume that the only spatial variable of interest is the altitude (stratified medium). An algorithm based on iterations of the sources is shown to be monotone and convergent. Numerical examples are given with highly varying absorption coefficient kappa and Rayleigh scattering as in the Earth atmosphere. To study the effect of CO2 in the atmosphere kappa is changed in the frequency ranges where CO2 is absorbing.</description>

      <title>The space of Hardy-weights for quasilinear operators on discrete graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Hardy inequalities for $p$-Schr\"odinger operators on general weighted graphs. Specifically, we prove a Maz'ya-type result, where we characterize the space of Hardy weights for $ p $-Schr\"odinger operators via a generalized capacity. The novel ingredient in the proof is the demonstration that the simplified energy of the $ p $-Schr\"odinger energy functional is compatible with certain normal contractions. As a consequence, we obtain a necessary integrability criterion for Hardy weights. Finally, using some tools of criticality theory, we investigate the existence of minimizers in the Hardy inequalities and discuss relations to Cheeger type estimates.</description>

      <title>On a multiscale formulation for multiperforated plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiperforated plates exhibit high gradients and a loss of regularity concentrated in a boundary layer for which a direct numerical simulation becomes very expensive. For elliptic equations the solution at some distance of the boundary is only affected in an effective way and the macroscopic and mesoscopic behaviour can be separated. A multiscale formulation in the spirit of the heterogeneous multiscale method is introduced on the example of the Poisson equation. Based on the method of matched asymptotic expansion the solution is separated into a macroscopic far field defined in a domain with only slowly varying boundary and a mesoscopic near field defined in scaled coordinates on possibly varying infinite periodicity cells. The near field has a polynomial behaviour that is coupled to the traces of the macroscopic variable on the mid-line of the multiperforated plate. A variational formulation using a Beppo-Levi space in the strip is introduced and its well-posedness is shown. The variational framework when truncating the infinite strip is discussed and the truncation error is estimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate an inverse problem of identifying a spatially variable order in the one-dimensional subdiffusion model from the boundary flux measurement. The model involves a generalized Caputo derivative in time, and arises in the mathematical modeling of anomalous diffusion in heterogeneous media. We prove the unique recovery of a monotone piecewise constant variable order and its range for known and unknown media, respectively. The analysis is based on a delicate asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transform of the data as $p\to0$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Measure and continuous vector field at a boundary I: propagation equations and wave observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated geometric control condition of Bardos, Lebeau, and Rauch is necessary and sufficient for wave observability [1,7] and exact controllability. It requires that any point in phase-space be transported by the generalized geodesic flow to the region of observation in some finite time. The initial smoothness (\Cinf) required on the coefficients of the metric to prove that exact control and geometric control are essentially equivalent was subsequently relaxed to \Con2-metrics/coefficients and \Con3-domains [2] which is close to the optimal smoothness required to preserve a generalized geodesic flow. In this article, we investigate a natural generalization of the geometric control condition that makes sense for \Con1-metrics and we prove that wave observability holds under this condition. Moreover, we establish that the observability property is stable under rougher (Lipschitz) perturbation of the metric. We also provide a geometric necessary condition for wave observability to hold. Transport equations that describe the propagation of semi-classical measures are at the heart of the arguments. They are natural extensions to geometries with boundaries of usual transport equations. This article is mainly dedicated to the proof of such propagation equations in this very rough context.</description>

      <title>Measure and continuous vector field at a boundary II: geodesics and support propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonnegative measures that are solutions to a transport equation with continuous coefficients have been widely studied. Because of the low regularity of the associated vector field, there is no natural flow since nonuniqueness of integral curves is the general rule. It has been known since the works by L. Ambrosio [2] and L. Ambrosio and G. Crippa [3, 4] that such measures can be described as a superposition of $\delta$-measures supported on integral curves. In this article, motivated by some observability questions for the wave equation, we are interested in such transport equations in the case of domains with boundary. Associated with a wave equation with C^1-coefficients are bicharacteristics that are integral curves of a continuous Hamiltonian vector field. We first study in details their behaviour in the presence of a boundary and define their natural generalisation that follows the laws of geometric optics. Then, we introduce a natural class of transport equations with a source term on the boundary, and we prove that any nonnegative measure satisfying such an equation has a union of maximal generalized bicharacteristics for support. This result is a weak form of the superposition principle in the presence of a boundary. With its companion article [7], this study completes the proof of wave observability generalizing the celebrated result of Bardos, Lebeau, and Rauch [5] in a low regularity framework where coefficients of the wave equation (and associated metric) are C^1 and the boundary and the manifold are C^2.</description>

      <title>Serrin's overdetermined problem in rough domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Serrin's overdetermined theorem states that a $C^2$ bounded domain, which admits a function with constant Laplacian that satisfies both constant Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, must necessarily be a ball. While extensions of this theorem to non-smooth domains have been explored since the 1990s, the applicability of Serrin's theorem to Lipschitz domains remained unresolved. This paper answers this open question affirmatively. Actually, our approach shows that the result holds for domains that are sets of finite perimeter with a uniform upper bound on the density, and it also allows for slit discontinuities.</description>

      <title>On the multicomponent reactive flows in moving domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the existence of global-in-time weak solutions to the multicomponent reactive flows inside a moving domain whose shape in time is prescribed. The flow is governed by the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system coupled with the equations of species mass fractions. The fluid velocity is supposed to fulfill the complete slip boundary condition, whereas the heat flux and species diffusion fluxes satisfy the conservative boundary conditions. The existence of weak solutions is obtained by means of suitable approximation techniques. To this end, we need to rigorously analyze the penalization of the boundary behavior, viscosity and the pressure in the weak formulation.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for bounded, divergence-free vector fields b in L^1_{loc}((0,1];BV(\T^d;\R^d)), there exists a unique incompressible measure on integral curves of b. We recall the vector field constructed by Depauw in [Depauw, C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2003], which lies in the above class, and prove that for this vector field, the unique incompressible measure on integral curves exhibits stochasticity.</description>

      <title>A multi-field decomposed model order reduction approach for thermo-mechanically coupled gradient-extended damage simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are crucial for comprehending how engineering structures behave under extreme conditions, particularly when dealing with thermo-mechanically coupled issues compounded by damage-induced material softening. However, such simulations often entail substantial computational expenses. To mitigate this, the focus has shifted towards employing model order reduction (MOR) techniques, which hold promise for accelerating computations. Yet, applying MOR to highly nonlinear, multi-physical problems influenced by material softening remains a relatively new area of research, with numerous unanswered questions. Addressing this gap, this study proposes and investigates a novel multi-field decomposed MOR technique, rooted in a snapshot-based Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Galerkin (POD-G) projection approach. Utilizing a recently developed thermo-mechanically coupled gradient-extended damage-plasticity model as a case study, this work demonstrates that splitting snapshot vectors into distinct physical fields (displacements, damage, temperature) and projecting them onto separate lower-dimensional subspaces can yield more precise and stable outcomes compared to conventional methods. Through a series of numerical benchmark tests, our multi-field decomposed MOR technique demonstrates its capacity to significantly reduce computational expenses in simulations involving severe damage, while maintaining a high level of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we establish the existence of solutions to the following critical Hartree equation \begin{align*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u=\left(\int_{\Omega_\varepsilon}\frac{u^{2_{\mu}^*}}{|x-y|^{\mu}}dy\right)u^{2_{\mu}^*-1}, &amp;\text{ in } \Omega_\varepsilon, \\ u=0, &amp;\text{ on } \partial\Omega_\varepsilon, \end{cases} \end{align*} where $2_{\mu}^*=\frac{2N-\mu}{N-2}$ is the upper critical exponent in the sense of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, $N\geq 5$, $0&lt;\mu&lt;4$ with $\mu$ sufficiently close to $0$, $\Omega_\varepsilon:=\Omega\backslash B(0,\varepsilon)$ and $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$, which contains the origin, and $\varepsilon$ is a positive parameter. As $\varepsilon$ goes to zero, we construct bubble solution which blows up at the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mapping behavior of the Marchaud fractional derivative with different extensions in the scale of fractional weighted Sobolev spaces. In particular we show that the $\alpha$--order Riemann--Liouville fractional derivative maps $W^{p,s}_0(\Omega)$ to $W^{p,s-\alpha}(\Omega)$, for all $0&lt;\alpha&lt;s&lt;1$ and the $\alpha$--order Marchaud fractional derivative with even extension maps the fractional Sobolev space $W^{p,s}((0,\infty))$ to $W^{p,s-\alpha}(\real)$ for all $0&lt;\alpha&lt;s&lt;1$ and $ps\geq1$ . The proof is based on the Calder\'{o}n--Lions interpolation theorem.</description>

      <title>Adaptive control of reaction-diffusion PDEs via neural operator-approximated gain kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operator approximations of the gain kernels in PDE backstepping has emerged as a viable method for implementing controllers in real time. With such an approach, one approximates the gain kernel, which maps the plant coefficient into the solution of a PDE, with a neural operator. It is in adaptive control that the benefit of the neural operator is realized, as the kernel PDE solution needs to be computed online, for every updated estimate of the plant coefficient. We extend the neural operator methodology from adaptive control of a hyperbolic PDE to adaptive control of a benchmark parabolic PDE (a reaction-diffusion equation with a spatially-varying and unknown reaction coefficient). We prove global stability and asymptotic regulation of the plant state for a Lyapunov design of parameter adaptation. The key technical challenge of the result is handling the 2D nature of the gain kernels and proving that the target system with two distinct sources of perturbation terms, due to the parameter estimation error and due to the neural approximation error, is Lyapunov stable. To verify our theoretical result, we present simulations achieving calculation speedups up to 45x relative to the traditional finite difference solvers for every timestep in the simulation trajectory.</description>

      <title>Error analysis for a viscoelastic phase separation mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider systematic numerical approximation of a viscoelastic phase separation model that describes the demixing of a polymer solvent mixture. An unconditionally stable discretisation method is proposed based on a finite element approximation in space and a variational time discretization strategy. The proposed method preserves the energy-dissipation structure of the underlying system exactly and allows to establish a fully discrete nonlinear stability estimate in natural norms based on the concept of relative energy. These estimates are used to derive order optimal error estimates for the method under minimal smoothness assumptions on the problem data, despite the presence of various strong nonlinearities in the equations. The theoretical results and main properties of the method are illustrated by numerical simulations which also demonstrate the capability to reproduce the relevant physical effects observed in experiments.</description>

Abstract: We establish the Anderson localization and exponential dynamical localization for a class of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with bounded or unbounded Lipschitz monotone potentials via multi-scale analysis based on Rellich function analysis in the perturbative regime. We show that at each scale, the resonant Rellich function uniformly inherits the Lipschitz monotonicity property of the potential via a novel Schur complement argument.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Fractional PDEs from interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these notes, we describe the strategy for the derivation of the hydrodynamic limit for a family of long range interacting particle systems of exclusion type with symmetric rates. For $m \in \mathbb{N}:=\{1, 2, \ldots\}$ fixed, the hydrodynamic equation is $\partial_t \rho(t,u)= [-(-\Delta)^{\gamma /2} \rho^m](t,u) $. For $m=1$, this {is} the fractional equation, which is linear. On the other hand, for $m \geq 2$, this is the fractional porous medium equation (which is nonlinear), obtained by choosing a rate which depends on the number of particles next to the initial and final position of a jump.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the (normalized) Li-Yau conformal volume of a self-shrinker of mean curvature flow in Euclidean space bounds its Colding-Minicozzi entropy from below. This bound is independent of codimension and sharp on planes. As an application we verify a conjecture of Colding-Minicozzi about the entropy of closed self-shrinkers of arbitrary codimension for self-shrinkers that are topologically two-dimensional real projective planes. As part of the proof we introduce two auxiliary functionals which we call stable conformal volume and virtual entropy which should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear parabolic forward-backward problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11067v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the well-posedness of several linear and nonlinear equations with a parabolic forward-backward structure, and to highlight the similarities and differences between them. The epitomal linear example will be the stationary Kolmogorov equation $y\partial_x u -\partial_{yy} u=f$ in a rectangle. We first prove that this equation admits a finite number of singular solutions, of which we provide an explicit construction. Hence, the solutions to the Kolmogorov equation associated with a smooth source term are regular if and only if $f$ satisfies a finite number of orthogonality conditions. This is similar to well-known phenomena in elliptic problems in polygonal domains.
  We then extend this theory to a Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck system, and to two quasilinear equations: the Burgers type equation $u \partial_x u - \partial_{yy} u = f$ in the vicinity of the linear shear flow, and the Prandtl system in the vicinity of a recirculating solution, close to the line where the horizontal velocity changes sign. We therefore revisit part of a recent work by Iyer and Masmoudi. For the two latter quasilinear equations, we introduce a geometric change of variables which simplifies the analysis. In these new variables, the linear differential operator is very close to the Kolmogorov operator $y\partial_x -\partial_{yy}$. Stepping on the linear theory, we prove existence and uniqueness of regular solutions for data within a manifold of finite codimension, corresponding to some nonlinear orthogonality conditions.</description>

      <title>Potential Singularity of the Axisymmetric Euler Equations with $C^\alpha$ Initial Vorticity for A Large Range of $\alpha$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide numerical evidence for a potential finite-time self-similar singularity of the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl and with $C^\alpha$ initial vorticity for a large range of $\alpha$. We employ a highly effective adaptive mesh method to resolve the potential singularity sufficiently close to the potential blow-up time. Resolution study shows that our numerical method is at least second-order accurate. Scaling analysis and the dynamic rescaling method are presented to quantitatively study the scaling properties of the potential singularity. We demonstrate that this potential blow-up is stable with respect to the perturbation of initial data. Our numerical study shows that the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with our initial data develop finite-time blow-up when the H\"older exponent $\alpha$ is smaller than some critical value $\alpha^*$, which has the potential to be $1/3$. We also study the $n$-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl, and observe that the critical H\"older exponent $\alpha^*$ is close to $1-\frac{2}{n}$. Compared with Elgindi's blow-up result in a similar setting \cite{elgindi2021finite}, our potential blow-up scenario has a different H\"older continuity property in the initial data and the scaling properties of the two initial data are also quite different. We also propose a relatively simple one-dimensional model and numerically verify its approximation to the $n$-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations. This one-dimensional model sheds useful light to our understanding of the blow-up mechanism for the $n$-dimensional Euler equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Part II of this sequence to our previous paper for the 3-dimensional Euler equations \cite{zhang2022potential}, we investigate potential singularity of the $n$-diemnsional axisymmetric Euler equations with $C^\alpha$ initial vorticity for a large range of $\alpha$. We use the adaptive mesh method to solve the $n$-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations and use the scaling analysis and dynamic rescaling method to examine the potential blow-up and capture its self-similar profile. Our study shows that the $n$-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with our initial data develop finite-time blow-up when the H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha&lt;\alpha^*$, and this upper bound $\alpha^*$ can asymptotically approach $1-\frac{2}{n}$. Moreover, we introduce a stretching parameter $\delta$ along the $z$-direction. Based on a few assumptions inspired by our numerical experiments, we obtain $\alpha^*=1-\frac{2}{n}$ by studying the limiting case of $\delta \rightarrow 0$. For the general case, we propose a relatively simple one-dimensional model and numerically verify its approximation to the $n$-dimensional Euler equations. This one-dimensional model sheds useful light to our understanding of the blowup mechanism for the $n$-dimensional Euler equations. As shown in \cite{zhang2022potential}, the scaling behavior and regularity properties of our initial data are quite different from those of the initial data considered by Elgindi in \cite{elgindi2021finite}.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem to the 3D fractional compressible isentropic generalized Navier-Stokes equations for viscous compressible fluid with one Levy diffusion process. We obtain the existence and uniqueness of global strong solution for small initial data by providing several commutators via the Littlewood-Paley theory. Moreover, we derive $L^2$-decay rate for the highest derivative of the strong solution without decay loss by using a cancellation of a low-medium-frequency quantity. Our results improve the results provided in [J. Differential Equations 377(2023): 369-417].</description>

      <title>Stability of fronts in the diffusive Rosenzweig-MacArthur model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a diffusive Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model in the situation when the prey diffuses at the rate much smaller than that of the predator. In a certain parameter regime, the existence of fronts in the system is known: the underlying dynamical system in a singular limit is reduced to a scalar Fisher-KPP equation and the fronts supported by the full system are small perturbations of the Fisher-KPP fronts. The existence proof is based on application of the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory with respect to two small parameters. This paper is focused on the stability of the fronts. We analyze the stability by means of energy estimates, exponential dichotomies, the Evans function calculation, and a technique that involves constructing the unstable augmented bundles. The energy estimates provide bounds on the unstable spectrum which depend on the small parameters of the system; the bounds are inversely proportional to these parameters. We further improve these estimates by showing that the eigenvalue problem is a small perturbation of some limiting (as the modulus of the eigenvalue parameter goes to infinity) system, and that the limiting system has exponential dichotomies. Persistence of the exponential dichotomies then leads to bounds uniform in the small parameters. The main novelty of this approach is related to the fact that the limit of the eigenvalue problem is not autonomous. We then use the concept of the unstable augmented bundles and by treating these as multiscale topological structures with respect to the same two small parameters consequently as in the existence proof, we show that the stability of the fronts is also governed by the scalar Fisher-KPP equation.</description>

      <title>Periodic localized traveling waves in the two-dimensional suspension bridge equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the dynamics generated by the suspension bridge equation, traveling waves are an essential feature. The existing literature focuses primarily on the idealized one-dimensional case, while traveling structures in two spatial dimensions have only been studied via numerical simulations. We use computer-assisted proof methods based on a Newton-Kantorovich type argument to find and prove periodic localized traveling waves in two dimensions. The main obstacle is the exponential nonlinearity in combination with the resulting large amplitude of the localized waves. Our analysis hinges on establishing computable bounds to control the aliasing error in the computed Fourier coefficients. This leads to existence proofs of different traveling wave solutions, accompanied by small, explicit, rigorous bounds on the deficiency of numerical approximations. This approach is directly extendable to other wave equation models and elliptic partial differential equations with analytic nonlinearities, in two as well as in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Projection scheme for a perfect plasticity model with a time-dependent constraint set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new numerical scheme for a system that includes evolution equations describing a perfect plasticity model with a time-dependent yield surface. We demonstrate that the solution to the proposed scheme is stable under suitable norms. Moreover, the stability leads to the existence of an exact solution, and we also prove that the solution to the proposed scheme converges strongly to the exact solution under suitable norms.</description>

      <title>Solving fluid flow problems in space-time with multiscale stabilization: formulation and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a space-time continuous-Galerkin finite element method for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. To ensure stability of the discrete variational problem, we apply ideas from the variational multi-scale method. The finite element problem is posed on the ``full" space-time domain, considering time as another dimension. We provide a rigorous analysis of the stability and convergence of the stabilized formulation. And finally, we apply this method on two benchmark problems in computational fluid dynamics, namely, lid-driven cavity flow and flow past a circular cylinder. We validate the current method with existing results from literature and show that very large space-time blocks can be solved using our approach.</description>

      <title>Policy Iteration for Exploratory Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the policy iteration algorithm (PIA) for entropy-regularized stochastic control problems on an infinite time horizon with a large discount rate, focusing on two main scenarios. First, we analyze PIA with bounded coefficients where the controls applied to the diffusion term satisfy a smallness condition. We demonstrate the convergence of PIA based on a uniform $\mathcal{C}^{2,\alpha}$ estimate for the value sequence generated by PIA, and provide a quantitative convergence analysis for this scenario. Second, we investigate PIA with unbounded coefficients but no control over the diffusion term. In this scenario, we first provide the well-posedness of the exploratory Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation with linear growth coefficients and polynomial growth reward function. By such a well-posedess result we achieve PIA's convergence by establishing a quantitative locally uniform $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ estimates for the generated value sequence.</description>
