      <title>Performance Guarantees for Data Freshness in Resource-Constrained Adversarial IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely updates are critical for real-time monitoring and control applications powered by the Internet of Things (IoT). As these systems scale, they become increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where malicious agents interfere with legitimate transmissions to reduce data rates, thereby inflating the age of information (AoI). Existing adversarial AoI models often assume stationary channels and overlook queueing dynamics arising from compromised sensing sources operating under resource constraints. Motivated by the G-queue framework, this paper investigates a two-source M/G/1/1 system in which one source is adversarial and disrupts the update process by injecting negative arrivals according to a Poisson process and inducing i.i.d. service slowdowns, bounded in attack rate and duration. Using moment generating functions, we then derive closed-form expressions for average and peak AoI for an arbitrary number of sources. Moreover, we introduce a worst-case constrained attack model and employ stochastic dominance arguments to establish analytical AoI bounds. Numerical results validate the analysis and highlight the impact of resource-limited adversarial interference under general service time distributions.</description>

      <title>TCP BBR Performance over Wi-Fi~6: AQM Impacts and Cross-Layer Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate TCP BBRv3 on Wi-Fi 6 home networks under modern AQM schemes using a fully wireless testbed and a simple cross-layer model linking Wi-Fi scheduling, router queueing, and BBRv3's pacing dynamics. Comparing BBR Internet traffic with CUBIC across different AQMs (FIFO, FQ-CoDel, and CAKE) for uplink, downlink, and bidirectional traffic, we find that FIFO destabilizes pacing and raises delay, often letting CUBIC dominate; FQ-CoDel restores fairness and controls latency; and CAKE delivers the best overall performance by keeping delay low and aligning BBRv3's sending and delivered rates. We also identify a Wi-Fi-specific effect where CAKE's rapid queue draining, while improving pacing alignment, can trigger brief retransmission bursts during BBRv3's bandwidth probes. These results follow from the interaction of variable Wi-Fi service rates, AQM delay control, and BBRv3's inflight limits, leading to practical guidance to use FQ-CoDel or CAKE and avoid unmanaged FIFO in home Wi-Fi, with potential for Wi-Fi-aware tuning of BBRv3's probing.</description>

      <title>Wireless Copilot: An AI-Powered Partner for Navigating Next-Generation Wireless Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) of wireless networks introduces a level of operational complexity that exceeds the limits of traditional automation and manual oversight. This paper introduces the "Wireless Copilot", an AI-powered technical assistant designed to function as a collaborative partner for human network designers, engineers, and operators. We posit that by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with a robust cognitive framework. It will surpass the existing AI tools and interact with wireless devices, transmitting the user's intentions into the actual network execution process. Then, Wireless Copilot can translate high-level human intent into precise, optimized, and verifiable network actions. This framework bridges the gap between human expertise and machine-scale complexity, enabling more efficient, intelligent, and trustworthy management of 6G systems. Wireless Copilot will be a novel layer between the wireless infrastructure and the network operators. Moreover, we explore Wireless Copilot's methodology and analyze its application in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks (LAWNets) assisting 6G networking, including network design, configuration, evaluation, and optimization. Additionally, we present a case study on intent-based LAWNets resource allocation, demonstrating its superior adaptability compared to others. Finally, we outline future research directions toward creating a comprehensive human-AI collaborative ecosystem for the 6G era.</description>

      <title>How Many Pinching Antennas Are Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) have emerged as a key paradigm for next-generation communication networks, aiming to transform wireless propagation from an uncontrollable phenomenon into a reconfigurable process that can adapt to diverse service requirements. In this framework, pinching-antenna systems (PASs) have recently been proposed as a promising enabling technology, as they allow the radiation location and effective propagation distance to be adjusted by selectively exciting radiating points along a dielectric waveguide. However, most existing studies on PASs rely on the idealized assumption that pinching-antenna (PA) positions can be continuously adjusted along the waveguide, while realistically only a finite set of pinching locations is available. Motivated by this, this paper analyzes the performance of two-state PASs, where the PA positions are fixed and only their activation state can be controlled. By explicitly accounting for the spatial discreteness of the available pinching points, closed-form analytical expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic achievable data rate are derived. In addition, we introduce the pinching discretization efficiency to quantify the performance gap between discrete and continuous pinching configurations, enabling a direct assessment of the number of PAs required to approximate the ideal continuous case. Finally, numerical results validate the analytical framework and show that near-continuous performance can be achieved with a limited number of PAs, offering useful insights for the design and deployment of PASs in PWEs.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware Load Balancing in the Computing Continuum via Multi-Player Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As computation shifts from the cloud to the edge to reduce processing latency and network traffic, the resulting Computing Continuum (CC) creates a dynamic environment where it is challenging to meet strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and avoid service instance overload. Existing methods often prioritize global metrics, overlooking per-client QoS, which is crucial for latency-sensitive and reliability-critical applications. We propose QEdgeProxy, a decentralized QoS-aware load balancer that acts as a proxy between IoT devices and service instances in CC. We formulate the load balancing problem as a Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit (MP-MAB) with heterogeneous rewards, where each load balancer autonomously selects service instances that maximize the probability of meeting its clients' QoS targets by using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate QoS success probabilities. It also incorporates an adaptive exploration mechanism to recover rapidly from performance shifts and non-stationary conditions. We present a Kubernetes-native QEdgeProxy implementation and evaluate it on an emulated CC testbed deployed on a K3s cluster with realistic network conditions and a latency-sensitive edge-AI workload. Results show that QEdgeProxy significantly outperforms proximity-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in per-client QoS satisfaction, while adapting effectively to load surges and instance availability changes.</description>

      <title>Optimal 3D Directional WPT Charging via UAV for 3D Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high mobility and flexible deployment capability of UAVs make them an impressive option for charging nodes in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) using Directional Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. However, existing studies largely focus on 2D-WRSNs, lacking designs catering to real 3D-WRSNs. The spatial distribution characteristics of nodes in a 3D-WRSN further increase the complexity of the charging scheduling task, thus requiring a systematic framework to solve this problem. In this paper, we investigated the Directional UAV Charging Scheduling problem for 3D-WRSNs (DCS-3D) and established its NP-hard property, and then proposed a three-step framework named as directional charging scheduling algorithm using Functional Equivalent (FuncEqv) direction set and Lin-Kernighan heuristic (LKH) for 3D-WRSNs (FELKH-3D) to solve it. In FELKH-3D, the challenge of infinite charging direction space is solved by designing an algorithm generating a minimum-size direction set guaranteed to be FuncEqv to the infinite set of whole sphere surface, and the optimaility of the method was proved.To determine the optimal charging tour for the UAV, the LKH algorithm is employed.Simulation experiments demonstrated the superiority of FELKH-3D over other classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>BEVCooper: Accurate and Communication-Efficient Bird's-Eye-View Perception in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) is critical to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) as it can provide unified and precise representation of vehicular surroundings. However, quality of the raw sensing data may degrade in occluded or distant regions, undermining the fidelity of constructed BEV map. In this paper, we propose BEVCooper, a novel collaborative perception framework that can guarantee accurate and low-latency BEV map construction. We first define an effective metric to evaluate the utility of BEV features from neighboring CAVs. Then, based on this, we develop an online learning-based collaborative CAV selection strategy that captures the ever-changing BEV feature utility of neighboring vehicles, enabling the ego CAV to prioritize the most valuable sources under bandwidth-constrained vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. Furthermore, we design an adaptive fusion mechanism that optimizes BEV feature compression based on the environment dynamics and real-time V2V channel quality, effectively balancing feature transmission latency and accuracy of the constructed BEV map. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, BEVCooper achieves asymptotically optimal CAV selection and adaptive feature fusion under dynamic vehicular topology and V2V channel conditions. Extensive experiments on real-world testbed show that, compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed BEVCooper enhances BEV perception accuracy by up to $63.18\%$ and reduces end-to-end latency by $67.9\%$, with only $1.8\%$ additional computational overhead.</description>

      <title>On Network-Aware Semantic Communication and Edge-Cloud Collaborative Intelligence Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication and edge-cloud collaborative intelligence are increasingly recognized as foundational enablers for next-generation intelligent services operating under stringent bandwidth, latency, and resource constraints. By shifting the communication objective from bit-perfect delivery toward the transmission of task-relevant semantic representations, semantic communication enables adaptive tradeoffs among communication overhead, inference accuracy, computational load, and end-to-end latency. This survey provides a comprehensive and system-level synthesis of recent advances in semantic communication at the edge-cloud interface, encompassing architectural models for collaborative intelligence, representation learning and semantic abstraction techniques, network-aware and resource-adaptive semantic encoding strategies, and learning-driven optimization and orchestration mechanisms. Beyond efficiency considerations, the survey situates semantic communication within practical operational contexts, including security, trust, resilience, and scalability, drawing connections to zero-trust networking, physical-layer security, and emerging edge-cloud control paradigms. Finally, open challenges and research directions are identified, highlighting the role of semantic communication as a key building block for AI-native networking and 6G-ready intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>CORE: Compensable Reward as a Catalyst for Improving Offline RL in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world wireless data are expensive to collect and often lack sufficient expert demonstrations, causing existing offline RL methods to overfit suboptimal behaviors and exhibit unstable performance. To address this issue, we propose CORE, an offline RL framework specifically designed for wireless environments. CORE identifies latent expert trajectories from noisy datasets via behavior embedding clustering, and trains a conditional variational autoencoder with a contrastive objective to separate expert and non-expert behaviors in latent space. Based on the learned representations, CORE constructs compensable rewards that reflect expert-likelihood, effectively guiding policy learning under limited or imperfect supervision. More broadly, this work represents one of the early systematic explorations of offline RL in wireless networking, where prior adoption remains limited. Beyond introducing offline RL techniques to this domain, we further examine intrinsic wireless data characteristics and develop a domain-aligned algorithm that explicitly accounts for their structural properties. While offline RL has not yet been fully established as a standard methodology in the wireless community, our study aims to provide foundational insights and empirical evidence to support its broader acceptance.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Pipeline Parallelism for Real-Time Multilingual Lip Synchronization in Video Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a parallel and asynchronous Transformer framework designed for efficient and accurate multilingual lip synchronization in real-time video conferencing systems. The proposed architecture integrates translation, speech processing, and lip-synchronization modules within a pipeline-parallel design that enables concurrent module execution through message-queue-based decoupling, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3.1 times compared to sequential approaches. To enhance computational efficiency and throughput, the inference workflow of each module is optimized through low-level graph compilation, mixed-precision quantization, and hardware-accelerated kernel fusion. These optimizations provide substantial gains in efficiency while preserving model accuracy and visual quality. In addition, a context-adaptive silence-detection component segments the input speech stream at semantically coherent boundaries, improving translation consistency and temporal alignment across languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed parallel architecture outperforms conventional sequential pipelines in processing speed, synchronization stability, and resource utilization. The modular, message-oriented design makes this work applicable to resource-constrained IoT communication scenarios including telemedicine, multilingual kiosks, and remote assistance systems. Overall, this work advances the development of low-latency, resource-efficient multimodal communication frameworks for next-generation AIoT systems.</description>

      <title>Implementing Transport Coding in OMNeT++ for Message Delay Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport coding reduces message delay in packet-switched networks by introducing controlled redundancy at the transport layer: $k$ original packets are encoded into $n\ge k$ coded packets, and the message is reconstructed after the first $k$ successful deliveries, effectively shifting latency from the maximum packet delay to the $k$-th order statistic. We present a concise, reproducible discrete-event implementation of transport coding in OMNeT++, including a multi-hop Kleinrock-type network, FIFO queues, exponential service and link delays, and explicit receiver-side reconstruction that records message delay and deadline violations. Using paired uncoded ($n{=}k$) and coded ($n{&gt;}k$) configurations at the same message generation rate, we compare delay, reliability, and saturation effects across code rates and input loads. Simulation results show consistent reductions of average delay and late-delivery probability for moderate redundancy, while keeping the saturation throughput close to the uncoded baseline. The proposed model provides a transparent bridge between analytical transport-coding formulas and executable simulation for tuning redundancy in low-latency services.</description>

      <title>Protecting Human Activity Signatures in Compressed IEEE 802.11 CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit channel state information (CSI) feedback in IEEE~802.11 conveys \emph{transmit beamforming directions} by reporting quantized Givens rotation and phase angles that parametrize the right-singular subspace of the channel matrix. Because these angles encode fine-grained spatial signatures of the propagation environment, recent work have shown that plaintext CSI feedback can inadvertently reveal user activity, identity, and location to passive eavesdroppers. In this work, we introduce a standards-compatible \emph{differentially private (DP) quantization mechanism} that replaces deterministic angular quantization with an $\varepsilon$-DP stochastic quantizer applied directly to the Givens parameters of the transmit beamforming matrix. The mechanism preserves the 802.11 feedback structure, admits closed-form sensitivity bounds for the angular representation, and enables principled privacy calibration. Numerical simulations demonstrate strong privacy guarantees with minimal degradation in beamforming performance.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Remote Monitoring of Correlated Markovian Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate real-time tracking of two correlated stochastic processes over a shared wireless channel. The joint evolution of the processes is modeled as a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain. Each process is observed by a dedicated sampler and independently reconstructed at a remote monitor according to a task-specific objective. Although both processes originate from a common underlying phenomenon (e.g., distinct features of the same source), each monitor is interested only in its corresponding feature. A reconstruction error is incurred when the true and reconstructed states mismatch at one or both monitors. To address this problem, we propose an error-aware joint sampling and transmission policy, under which each sampler probabilistically generates samples only when the current process state differs from the most recently reconstructed state at its corresponding monitor. We adopt the time-averaged reconstruction error as the primary performance metric and benchmark the proposed policy against state-of-the-art joint sampling and transmission schemes. For each policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting time-averaged reconstruction error. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to an average sampling cost constraint. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed error-aware policy achieves the minimum time-averaged reconstruction error among the considered schemes while efficiently utilizing the sampling budget. The performance gains are particularly pronounced in regimes with strong inter-process correlation and stringent tracking requirements, where frequent sampling by both samplers is necessary.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Rate-Limited Closed-Loop Distributed Communication-Sensing-Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing integration of distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with closed-loop control in intelligent networks demands efficient information transmission under stringent bandwidth constraints. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a unified framework for goal-oriented semantic communication in distributed SCC systems. Building upon Weaver's three-level model, we establish a hierarchical semantic formulation with three error levels (L1: observation reconstruction, L2: state estimation, and L3: control) to jointly optimize their corresponding objectives. Based on this formulation, we propose a unified goal-oriented semantic compression and rate adaptation framework that is applicable to different semantic error levels and optimization goals across the SCC loop. A rate-limited multi-sensor LQR system is used as a case study to validate the proposed framework. We employ a GRU-based AE for semantic compression and a PPO-based rate adaptation algorithm that dynamically allocates transmission rates across sensors. Results show that the proposed framework effectively captures task-relevant semantics and adapts its resource allocation strategies across different semantic levels, thereby achieving level-specific performance gains under bandwidth constraints.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Intrusion Detection in IoT via SHAP-Guided Feature Pruning and Knowledge-Distilled Kronecker Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices requires intrusion detection systems (IDS) with high accuracy while operating under strict resource constraints. Conventional deep learning IDS are often too large and computationally intensive for edge deployment. We propose a lightweight IDS that combines SHAP-guided feature pruning with knowledge-distilled Kronecker networks. A high-capacity teacher model identifies the most relevant features through SHAP explanations, and a compressed student leverages Kronecker-structured layers to minimize parameters while preserving discriminative inputs. Knowledge distillation transfers softened decision boundaries from teacher to student, improving generalization under compression. Experiments on the TON\_IoT dataset show that the student is nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the teacher yet sustains macro-F1 above 0.986 with millisecond-level inference latency. The results demonstrate that explainability-driven pruning and structured compression can jointly enable scalable, low-latency, and energy-efficient IDS for heterogeneous IoT environments.</description>

      <title>A Fast Solver-Free Algorithm for Traffic Engineering in Large-Scale Data Center Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid growth of data center networks (DCNs) poses significant challenges for large-scale traffic engineering (TE). Existing acceleration strategies, which rely on commercial solvers or deep learning, face scalability issues and struggle with degrading performance or long computational time. Unlike existing algorithms adopting parallel strategies, we propose Sequential Source-Destination Optimization (SSDO), a sequential solver-free algorithm for TE. SSDO decomposes the problem into subproblems, each focused on adjusting the split ratios for a specific source-destination (SD) demand while keeping others fixed. To enhance the efficiency of subproblem optimization, we design a Balanced Binary Search Method (BBSM), which identifies the most balanced split ratios among multiple solutions that minimize Maximum Link Utilization (MLU). SSDO dynamically updates the sequence of SDs based on real-time utilization, which accelerates convergence and enhances solution quality. We evaluate SSDO on Meta DCNs and two wide-area networks. In a Meta topology, SSDO achieves a 65\% and 60\% reduction in normalized MLU compared to TEAL and POP, two state-of-the-art TE acceleration methods, while delivering a $12\times$ speedup over POP. These results demonstrate the superior performance of SSDO in large-scale TE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile networks are embracing disaggregation, reflected by the industry trend towards Open RAN. Private 5G networks are viewed as particularly suitable contenders as early adopters of Open RAN, owing to their setting, high degree of control, and opportunity for innovation they present. Motivated by this, we have recently deployed Campus5G, the first of its kind campus-wide, O-RAN-compliant private 5G testbed across the central campus of the University of Edinburgh. We present in detail our process developing the testbed, from planning, to architecting, to deployment, and measuring the testbed performance. We then discuss the lessons learned from building the testbed, and highlight some research opportunities that emerged from our deployment experience.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi: Twenty-Five Years and Counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today, Wi-Fi is over 25 years old. Yet, despite sharing the same branding name, today's Wi-Fi boasts entirely new capabilities that were not even on the roadmap 25 years ago. This article aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive technical and historical tutorial on Wi-Fi, beginning with IEEE 802.11b (Wi-Fi 1) and looking forward to IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8). This is the first tutorial article to span these eight generations. Rather than a generation-by-generation exposition, we describe the key mechanisms that have advanced Wi-Fi. We begin by discussing spectrum allocation and coexistence, and detailing the IEEE 802.11 standardization cycle. Second, we provide an overview of the physical layer and describe key elements that have enabled data rates to increase by over 1,000x. Third, we describe how Wi-Fi Medium Access Control has been enhanced from the original Distributed Coordination Function to now include capabilities spanning from frame aggregation to wideband spectrum access. Fourth, we describe how Wi-Fi 5 first broke the one-user-at-a-time paradigm and introduced multi-user access. Fifth, given the increasing use of mobile, battery-powered devices, we describe Wi-Fi's energy-saving mechanisms over the generations. Sixth, we discuss how Wi-Fi was enhanced to seamlessly aggregate spectrum across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to improve throughput, reliability, and latency. Finally, we describe how Wi-Fi enables nearby Access Points to coordinate in order to improve performance and efficiency. In the Appendix, we further discuss Wi-Fi developments beyond 802.11bn, including integrated mmWave operations, sensing, security and privacy extensions, and the adoption of AI/ML.</description>

      <title>Zephyrus: Scaling Gateways Beyond the Petabit-Era with DPU-Augmented Hierarchical Co-Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operating at petabit-scale, ByteDance's cloud gateways are deployed at critical aggregation points to orchestrate a wide array of business traffic. However, this massive scale imposes significant resource pressure on our previous-generation cloud gateways, rendering them unsustainable in the face of ever-growing cloud-network traffic. As the DPU market rapidly expands, we see a promising path to meet our escalating business traffic demands by integrating DPUs with our established Tofino-based gateways. DPUs augment these gateways with substantially larger table capacities and richer programmability without compromising previously low-latency and high-throughput forwarding. Despite compelling advantages, the practical integration of DPUs into cloud gateways remains unexplored, primarily due to underlying challenges. In this paper, we present Zephyrus, a production-scale gateway built upon a unified P4 pipeline spanning high-performance Tofino and feature-rich DPUs, which successfully overcomes these challenges. We further introduce a hierarchical co-offloading architecture (HLCO) to orchestrate traffic flow within this heterogeneous gateway, achieving &gt; 99% hardware offloading while retaining software fallback paths for complex operations. Zephyrus outperforms LuoShen (NSDI '24) with 33% higher throughput and our evaluation further indicates 21% lower power consumption and 14% lower hardware cost. Against FPGA-based systems, Albatross (SIGCOMM '25), it doubles the throughput at a substantially lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), showcasing its superior performance-per-dollar. Beyond these performance gains, we also share key lessons from several years of developing and operating Zephyrus at production scale. We believe these insights provide valuable references for researchers and practitioners designing performant cloud gateways.</description>

      <title>Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network (NOS) Scheduling for 6G O-RAN: Spectral Margin and Delay-Tail Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler for 6G radio access. The scheme couples a bounded two-state kernel to a clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head: the excitability state acts as a finite-buffer proxy, the recovery state suppresses repeated grants, and neighbour pressure is injected along the interference graph via delayed spikes. A small-signal analysis yields a delay-dependent threshold $k_\star(\Delta)$ and a spectral margin $\delta = k_\star(\Delta) - gH\rho(W)$ that compress topology, controller gain, and delay into a single design parameter. Under light assumptions on arrivals, we prove geometric ergodicity for $\delta&gt;0$ and derive sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds with exponents proportional to $\delta$. A numerical study, aligned with the analysis and a DU compute budget, compares NOS with PF and delayed backpressure (BP) across interference topologies over a $5$--$20$\,ms delay sweep. With a single gain fixed at the worst spectral radius, NOS sustains higher utilisation and a smaller 99.9th-percentile delay while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs.</description>

      <title>FUSION: Forecast-Embedded Agent Scheduling with Service Incentive Optimization over Distributed Air-Ground Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a first-of-its-kind forecasting-driven, incentive-inherent service provisioning framework for distributed air-ground integrated networks that explicitly accounts for human-machine coexistence. In our framework, vehicular-UAV agent pairs (APs) are proactively dispatched to overloaded hotspots to augment the computing capacity of edge servers (ESs), which in turn gives rise to a set of challenges that we jointly address: highly uncertain spatio-temporal workloads, spatio-temporal coupling between road traffic and UAV capacity, forecast-driven contracting risks, and heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of human users (HUs) and machine users (MUs). To address these challenges, we propose FUSION, a two-stage optimization framework, consisting of an offline stage and an online stage. In the offline stage, a liquid neural network-powered module performs multi-step spatio-temporal demand forecasting at distributed ESs, whose outputs are exploited by an enhanced ant colony optimization-based routing scheme and an auction-based incentive-compatible contracting mechanism, to jointly determine ES-AP contracts and pre-planned service routes. In the online stage, we formulate the congestion-aware task scheduling as a potential game among HUs, MUs, and heterogeneous ES/UAVs, and devise a potential-guided best-response dynamics algorithm that provably converges to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that FUSION consistently achieves higher social welfare and improved resource utilization, while maintaining latency and energy costs comparable to state-of-the-art baselines and preserving individual rationality, budget balance, and near-truthfulness.</description>

      <title>Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network for Event-Driven Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-critical networking requires low-latency decisions from sparse and bursty telemetry, where fixed-step neural inference waste computation. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a two-state neuron whose variables correspond to normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. NOS combines a saturating excitability nonlinearity for finite buffers, service and damping leaks, graph-local inputs with per-link gates and delays, and differentiable resets compatible with surrogate gradients and neuromorphic deployment. We establish existence and uniqueness of subthreshold equilibria, derive Jacobian-based local stability tests, and obtain a scalar network stability threshold that separates topology from node physics through a Perron-mode spectral condition. A stochastic arrival model aligned with telemetry smoothing links NOS responses to classical queueing behaviour while explaining increased variability near stability margins. Across chain, star, and scale-free graphs, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and temporal-GNN baselines under a common residual-based protocol, while providing practical calibration and stability rules suited to resource-constrained networking deployments.

      <title>Continuum: Efficient and Robust Multi-Turn LLM Agent Scheduling with KV Cache Time-to-Live</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: KV cache management is essential for efficient LLM inference. To maximize utilization, existing inference engines evict finished requests' KV cache if new requests are waiting. This policy breaks for agentic workloads, which interleave LLM calls with tools, introducing pauses that prevent effective KV reuse across turns. Since some tool calls have much shorter durations than human response multi-turn chatbot, it would be promising to retain the KV cache in during these tools. However, there are many challenges. First, we need to consider both the potential cost of recomputation or reloading (if CPU offloading enabled) and the increasing queueing delays after eviction from GPU. Second, due to the internal variance of tool call durations, we need the method to remain robust under limited predictability of tool call durations.
  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by introducing time-to-live mechanism for KV cache retaining. For LLM request that generates a tool call, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value determined by considering both the reload cost and ordering preserve benefit of retaining KV cache. Moreover, when the TTL expires, the KV cache can be automatically evicted to free up GPU memory, providing robust performance under edge cases. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum preserves multi-turn continuity, and reduces delay for complex agentic workflows. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times and its improvement scales with turn number increase. We release a preview version at: https://github.com/Hanchenli/vllm-continuum</description>
