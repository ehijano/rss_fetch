      <title>Linear map-making with LuSEE-Night</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LuSEE-Night is a pathfinder radio telescope on the lunar far side employing four 3-m monopole antennas arranged as two horizontal cross pseudo-dipoles on a rotational stage and sensitive to the radio sky in the 1-50 MHz frequency band. LuSEE-Night measures the corresponding 16 correlation products as a function of frequency. While each antenna combination measures radiation coming from a large area of the sky, their aggregate information as a function of phase in the lunar cycle and rotational stage position can be deconvolved into a low-resolution map of the sky. We study this deconvolution using linear map-making based on the Wiener filter algorithm. We illustrate how systematic effects can be effectively marginalised over as contributions to the noise covariance and demonstrate this technique on beam knowledge uncertainty and gain fluctuations. With reasonable assumptions about instrument performance, we show that LuSEE-Night should be able to map the sub-50 MHz sky at a ~5-degree resolution.</description>

      <title>Technosignature Searches of Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the discovery of the third confirmed interstellar object (ISO), 3I/ATLAS, we have entered a new phase in the exploration of these long-predicted objects. Though confirmed discovery of ISOs is quite recent, their utility as targets in the search for technosignatures (historically known as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence -- SETI) has been discussed for many decades. With the upcoming NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the discovery and tracking of such objects is expected to become routine, and thus so must our examination of these objects for possible technosignatures. Here we review the literature surrounding ISOs as targets for technosignatures, which provides a well-developed motivation for such exploration. We outline four broad classes of technosignatures that are well suited for ISO follow-up, including the type of data needed and the best timing for study. Given the limitations in the current understanding of ISOs, we show that care must be taken in identifying technosignatures based primarily on comparison to objects in the Solar System. We therefore provide a roadmap for careful and consistent study of the population of ISOs in the hope of identifying technosignatures.</description>

      <title>Towards millimagnitude Photometry at the Vera Rubin Observatory: Aerosol Monitoring with Quadband Dispersed Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the frontier of precision astronomical photometry continues to advance, correcting for time-variable atmospheric transmission becomes increasingly important. We describe an observational approach to monitoring optical attenuation due to atmospheric aerosols, using a multiband filter and disperser on the Auxiliary Telescope at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. This configuration allows us to perform simple aperture photometry on four notched-out spectral regions, covering 347 to 618 nm. We see clear evidence of temporal variations in extinction across these bands, which we attribute to variation in the aerosol content of the atmosphere above the observatory. The observed differences in extinction between the reddest and bluest band can exceed 5 mmag/airmass, highlighting the importance of including variable aerosols in the transmission of the atmosphere. We aspire to using precise determinations of the optical transmission of the atmosphere to enable a forward-modeling approach to achieving mmag photometric precision with Rubin data.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm Architecture for Radio Interferometric Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a foundational, scalable algorithm architecture for processing data from aperture synthesis radio telescopes. The analysis leading to the architecture is rooted in the theory of aperture synthesis, signal processing and numerical optimization keeping it scalable for variations in computing load, algorithmic complexity, and accommodate the continuing evolution of algorithms. It also adheres to scientific software design principles and use of modern performance engineering techniques providing a stable foundation for long-term scalability, performance, and development cost.
  We first show that algorithms for both calibration and imaging algorithms share a common mathematical foundation and can be expressed as numerical optimization problems. We then decompose the resulting mathematical framework into fundamental conceptual architectural components, and assemble calibration and imaging algorithms from these foundational components.
  For a physical architectural view, we used a library of algorithms implemented in the LibRA software for the various architectural components, and used the Kokkos framework in the compute-intensive components for performance portable implementation. This was deployed on hardware ranging from desktop-class computers to multiple super-computer class high-performance computing (HPC) and high-throughput computing (HTC) platforms with a variety of CPU and GPU architectures, and job schedulers (HTCondor and Slurm).
  As a test, we imaged archival data from the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) telescope in the A-array configuration for the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Using over 100 GPUs we achieve a processing rate of ~2 Terabyte per hour to make one of the deepest images in the 2 -- 4 GHz band with an RMS noise of ~1 microJy/beam.</description>

      <title>Information Field Theory -- Concepts, Applications, and AI-Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information field theory (IFT) is the application of probabilistic reasoning to fields. Physical fields are mathematical functions over continuous spaces that exhibit certain properties of regularity, such as limited variance and finite gradients. Inferring a field from an observational dataset should exploit these regularities. However, the finite number of constraints that the data provides is insufficient to determine the infinite number of degrees of freedom of a field. IFT enables us to derive optimal field inference algorithms that explicitly exploit domain knowledge. These algorithms can be implemented via Numerical Information Field Theory (NIFTy). In NIFTy, neural operator forward models can be written and inverted probabilistically. NIFTy thereby infers fields and their remaining uncertainties. This is achieved using novel variational inference schemes that scale quasi-linearly, even for ultra-high dimensional problems. This paper introduces the basic concepts of IFT and NIFTy, highlights a few of their astrophysical applications, and discusses their artificial intelligence (AI) perspective. Finally, UBIK (the Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit), an emerging customisation of NIFTy for a suite of astrophysical telescopes, is presented as a central tool to the topic of the UniversAI conference.</description>

      <title>GW-YOLO: Multi-transient segmentation in LIGO using computer vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data and their time-frequency representation from gravitational-wave interferometers present multiple opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence methods associated with signal and image processing. Closely connected with this is the real-time aspect associated with gravitational-wave interferometers and the astrophysical observations they perform; the discovery potential of these instruments can be significantly enhanced when data processing can be achieved in O(1s) timescales. In this work, we introduce a novel signal and noise identification tool based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. For its application into gravitational waves, we will refer to it as GW-YOLO. This tool can provide scene identification capabilities and essential information regarding whether an observed transient is any combination of noise and signal. Additionally, it supplies detailed time-frequency coordinates of the detected objects in the form of pixel masks, an essential property that can be used to understand and characterize astrophysical sources, as well as instrumental noise. The simultaneous identification of noise and signal, combined with precise pixel-level localization, represents a significant advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis. Our approach yields a 50\% detection efficiency for binary black hole signals at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15 when such signals overlap with transient noise artifacts. When noise artifacts overlap with binary neutron star signals, our algorithm attains 50\% detection efficiency at an SNR of 30. This presents the first quantitative assessment of the ability to detect astrophysical events overlapping with realistic, instrument noise present in gravitational-wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>Blade Antenna-SDR System Prototype for the CANTAR Global 21-cm Experiment: Simulations, Measurements, and In-Situ Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and initial testing of a low-frequency radio telescope prototype developed for the CANTAR (Colombian Antarctic Telescope for 21-cm Absorption during Reionization) experiment. Operating from 100 to 200 MHz, the system integrates a blade dipole antenna inspired by the EDGES high-band design with a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver. We report simulations of antenna impedance and beam chromaticity, along with SDR performance tests (Limenet Mini, Ettus E310, USRP2920). A dual-stage low-noise amplifier reduces system temperature, enabling foreground-sensitive observations. Radiometric estimates suggest sub-mK sensitivity is achievable with 1000 h of integration. This prototype forms part of Colombia's emerging infrastructure for 21-cm cosmology, with deployments planned in low-RFI sites in the Colombian Andes and Antarctica.</description>

      <title>All-Sky Imaging with Vector Sensor Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio astronomy observations at frequencies below 10~MHz could provide valuable science, such as measuring the cosmic dark age signal in the redshifted 21~cm hydrogen absorption line, detecting exoplanetary auroral emissions which lead to inferences about magnetic fields and atmospheres, and characterizing the effects of solar wind and coronal mass ejections on the magnetospheres of solar system planets. Despite their value, few resolved measurements in the sub-10~MHz band have been made. At frequencies below 10~MHz, the Earth's ionosphere reflects, attenuates, and distorts radio waves, making radio astronomy in this band possible only from space. However, a space-borne array would need thousands of electrically-small antennas to reach the sensitivity required for detecting faint astronomical signals, and it would need to be positioned far from the Earth to reduce the impact of Earth-based radio interference. Using more efficient antennas would minimize the number needed, and using antennas that are more resilient to interference would reduce the required distance from Earth. To this end, we consider constructing a low frequency array out of vector sensor antennas. These advanced antennas consist of three orthogonal dipole and three orthogonal loop antennas with a common phase centre. Their benefits include direction-finding and polarimetric capabilities, but they have not been considered for this application previously. We show that vector sensors can provide four times more Fisher information during interferometry than tripoles, simpler antennas that are commonly considered for space applications. We also present an all-sky imaging simulation to demonstrate a spherical harmonic imaging technique.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Local Hubble Parameter from the Thermal Evolution of Earth and Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of local (e.g., interplanetary) Hubble expansion is studied for a long time but remains a controversial subject till now; and of particular interest is a plausible value of the local Hubble parameter at the scale of the Solar system. Here, we tried to estimate the corresponding quantity by the analysis of surface temperatures on the Earth and Mars, which are formed by a competition between a variable luminosity of the Sun and increasing radii of the planetary orbits. Our work employs paleochemical and paleobiological data on the temperature of the ancient Earth, on the one hand, and geological data on the existence of an ocean of liquid water on the ancient Mars, on the other hand. As follows from our analysis, the martian data impose only a weak constraint on the admissible values of the Hubble parameter because of the unknown salinity - and, therefore, the freezing point - of the martian water. On the other hand, the terrestrial data turn out to be much more valuable, especially, for the Precambrian period, when temperature variation was sufficiently smooth and monotonic. For example, in the framework of standard LambdaCDM model with 70% of dark energy, contemporary value of the local Hubble parameter was found to be 70-90 km/s/Mpc under assumption that the Earth's surface temperature in the end of Precambrian equaled 45 C. This is in reasonable agreement both with the intergalactic data and with an independent estimate of the local Hubble parameter from tidal evolution of the Earth-Moon system.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Entropy Calculations of Water Predict the Interiors of Uranus and Neptune to be 15-30% Colder than Previous Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio free energy calculations are employed to derive the entropy of liquid and superionic water over a wide range of conditions in the interiors of Uranus and Neptune. The resulting adiabats are much shallower in pressure-temperature space than those adopted for earlier models of Uranus and Neptune. Our models for their interiors are thus much colder, increasing the likelihood that diamond rain or the recently predicted phase separation of planetary ices has occurred in the mantles of ice giant planets. Based on our ab initio data, we construct interior models for Uranus and Neptune with the Concentric MacLaurin Spheroid method that match the existing gravity measurements. We compare fully convective models with models that include a convective boundary between liquid and superionic water. We also share a code to characterize giant planet atmospheres where para and ortho hydrogen as well as helium are present.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Neural Network for Transient Detection without Image Subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images. This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only, thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging, while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray burst light curve reconstruction with predictive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts represent some of the most energetic and complex phenomena in the universe, characterized by highly variable light curves that often contain observational gaps. Reconstructing these light curves is essential for gaining deeper insight into the physical processes driving such events. This study proposes a machine learning-based framework for the reconstruction of gamma-ray burst light curves, focusing specifically on the plateau phase observed in X-ray data. The analysis compares the performance of three sequential modeling approaches: a bidirectional recurrent neural network, a gated recurrent architecture, and a convolutional model designed for temporal data. The findings of this study indicate that the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit model showed the best predictive accuracy among the evaluated models across all GRB types, as measured by Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, and Coefficient of Determination. Notably, Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit exhibited enhanced capability in modeling both gradual plateau phases and abrupt transient features, including flares and breaks, particularly in complex light-curve scenarios.</description>

      <title>TheUse of Conditional Variational Autoencoders in Generating Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that generates stellar spectra covering 4000 $\le$ $T_{\mathrm{eff}$ $\le$ 11,000 K, $2.0 \le \log g \le 5.0$ dex, $-1.5 \le [\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}] \le +1.5$ dex, $v\sin i \le 300$ km/s, $\xi_t$ between 0 and 4 km/s, and for any instrumental resolving powers less than 115,000. The spectra can be calculated in the wavelength range 4450-5400 \AA. Trained on a grid of \textsc{SYNSPEC} spectra, the network synthesizes a spectrum in around two orders of magnitude faster than line-by-line radiative transfer. We validate the CVAE on $10^4$ test spectra unseen during training. Pixel-wise statistics yield a median absolute residual of &lt;$1.8\times10^{-3}$ flux units with no wavelength-dependent bias. A residual error map across the parameters plane shows $\langle|\Delta F|\rangle&lt;2\times10^{-3}$ everywhere, and marginal diagnostics versus $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, $v\sin i$, $\xi_t$, and $[Fe/H]$\ reveal no relevant trends. These results demonstrate that the CVAE can serve as a drop-in, physics-aware surrogate for radiative transfer codes, enabling real-time forward modeling in stellar parameter inference and offering promising tools for spectra synthesis for large astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Auto-Cal: Automated and Continuous Geo-Referencing of All-Sky Imagers Using Fisheye Lens Modeling and Star Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fully automated and continuous calibration framework for All-Sky Imagers (ASIs) that significantly enhances the spatial accuracy and reliability of geo-referenced ASI data is presented. The technique addresses a critical bottleneck in ASI image data reliability and usability for real time space weather via automated geo-referencing under real-world field conditions. The system corrects the lens distortion in ASIs using a well-established fisheye lens model and automatically estimates camera orientation in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw angles relative to True North and the horizontal plane perpendicular to the zenith using star tracking. Unlike traditional methods that require manual intervention and periodic recalibration, Auto-Cal performs nightly unattended recalibrations using observed stellar motion, adapting to mechanical shifts or environmental changes. Each calibration step includes formal error estimates, allowing end users to assess the confidence of geo-located data in real-time. This capability enables dependable ASI operations in remote or unmanned settings and supports higher-fidelity integration with other geophysical instruments. Auto-Cal provides a scalable foundation for maintaining a large array of ASIs, thus enabling long-term atmospheric monitoring and real-time space weather alerts.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gravitational Waves from Exoplanets Orbiting Binary Neutron Stars with B-DECIGO and DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) signal in 2015 has opened a new observational window to probe the universe. This probe can not only reveal previously inaccessible binaries, black holes, and other compact objects, but also can detect exoplanets through their imprint on GW signals, thereby significantly extend current exoplanet surveys. To date, nearly 6000 exoplanets have been confirmed, yet most of them reside either in the solar neighbourhood or along the sightline toward the Galactic bulge, reflecting the range limits of traditional electromagnetic techniques. In this work, we follow the method proposed in N.Tamanini&amp;C.Danielski(2019) to investigate frequency modulations in GW signals from early-stage binary neutron stars (BNSs) induced by circumbinary planets (CBPs) and obtain that CBPs can be detected by the future space-borne detector DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO). For BNS system with the masses of two components both being 1.4 $M_{\odot}$, DECIGO could detect CBPs with mass being dozens of times that of Jupiter out to distances of $\sim 1$ Gpc, well beyond the Local Supercluster, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution for the post main-sequence stage.</description>

      <title>Performance Studies of Layered Water Cherenkov Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation air-shower detectors, such as the Global Cosmic Ray Observatory (GCOS) and the Probing Extreme PeVatron Sources (PEPS) experiment, are considering water-Cherenkov detectors as a base design. A key factor in improving the sensitivity to ultra-high-energy gamma rays and to the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is the ability to measure the muonic content of air showers. To address this, a layered water Cherenkov tank design has been previously proposed. The water volume of the tank is divided into two optically separated layers. The electromagnetic component of the shower is mostly absorbed in the top layer, while the bottom layer records the light produced by through-going muons. Two prototype tanks were deployed at the Pierre Auger Observatory site in 2014 and have been recording data for more than 10 years. We present the performance of the prototype tanks and compare it with simulations, focusing mostly on the calibration. We investigate different dimensions for the water volumes. For the GCOS Observatory, one important challenge is to cover extremely large surfaces of 40000 km$^2$ to 60000 km$^2$ and achieve 100% efficiency at 10 EeV. Based on the size of the footprint of air-showers, we compute the number and spacing of detectors needed to fulfill the GCOS requirements.</description>

      <title>Superconducting NbN Resonator Parametric Amplifiers for Millimetre Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the development of a reactive sputtering process for high $T_\mathrm{c}$ NbN films with high normal-state resistivity, tailored for kinetic inductance parametric amplifiers. The process includes precise control to ensure full nitridation of the target prior to deposition. Under optimized conditions, the resulting NbN thin films exhibit a critical temperature of $10.5\,\mathrm{K}$ and a resistivity of $\sim1000\,\mathrm{\mu\Omega\,cm}$. The high $T_\mathrm{c}$ of the NbN thin-films suggests strong potential for application over the entire millimetre-wave frequency range from $24\,\mathrm{GHz}$ to $300\,\mathrm{GHz}$, whereas the high resistivity suggests a reduced power requirement for the pump tone to achieve high gain. Resonator parametric amplifiers have been fabricated from these films using coplanar waveguide geometry. The devices were able to produce high gain exceeding $20\,\mathrm{dB}$ at $25\,\mathrm{GHz}$, with artefact-free, reproducible amplification profiles in good agreement with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Solar Observation with MeerKAT: Demonstration of Technical Readiness and Initial Science Highlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar radio emissions offer unique diagnostic insights into the solar corona. However, their dynamic and multiscale nature, along with several orders of magnitude variations in intensity, pose significant observational challenges. To date, at gigahertz frequencies, MeerKAT stands out globally with high potential of producing high-fidelity, spectroscopic snapshot images of the Sun, enabled by its dense core, high sensitivity, and broad frequency coverage. Yet, as a telescope originally designed for observing faint galactic and extragalactic sources, observing the Sun at the boresight of the telescope requires customized observing strategies and calibration methods. This work demonstrates the technical readiness of MeerKAT for solar observations at the boresight of the telescope in the UHF (580-1015 MHz) and L-band (900-1670 MHz) frequency ranges, including optimized modes, a dedicated calibration scheme, and a tailored, entirely automated calibration and imaging pipeline. The quality of solar images is validated through morphological comparisons with the solar images at other wavelengths. Several unique early science results showcase the potential of this new capability of MeerKAT. Once fully commissioned and operational, this will unlock novel solar studies, significantly expand the scientific portfolio of MeerKAT, and lay the groundwork for solar observations with the mid-frequency telescope of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory, for which MeerKAT serves as a precursor.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework to Follow-up Continuous Gravitational Wave Candidates from Deep Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broad all-sky searches for continuous gravitational waves have high computational costs and require hierarchical pipelines. The sensitivity of these approaches is set by the initial search and by the number of candidates from that stage that can be followed-up. The current follow-up schemes for the deepest surveys require careful tuning and set-up, have a significant human-labor cost and this impacts the number of follow-ups that can be afforded. Here we present and demonstrate a new follow-up framework based on Bayesian parameter estimation for the rapid, highly automated follow-up of candidates produced by the early stages of deep, wide-parameter space searches for continuous waves.</description>

      <title>A Revision for the Draconic Gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, the eclipse events of Saros spiral and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our research is focused on the missing, but important and necessary Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism. The three Lunar cycles Sidereal, Synodic and Anomalistic are represented on the Mechanism by correlating the Fragments A and C (part of the Front plate), whereas the fourth Lunar cycle Draconic results after correlating the unplaced Fragment D with Fragment A. Considering the deformation of the Mechanism s parts during 2000 years underwater and their shrinkage after their retraction from the sea bottom, we present a revised gearing scheme of the Draconic scale. The existence of the Draconic gearing is crucial, because both the preserved and the missing eclipse events can be precalculated by the phase correlation of three pointers: of the Lunar Disc, of the Golden sphere/Sun-ray and the Draconic. This means that the eclipse events are calculated by pure mechanical processing and that they are not documented observed events. The phase coordination of the three lunar cycles can be used as a quality criterion for a functional model of the Mechanism. Eudoxus papyrus was the key for the lost words completion of the Back Plate inscriptions eclipse events classification of the Antikythera Mechanism.</description>

      <title>A unified model of feed rotation in radio telescopes and GNSS antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a model that accounts for the phase rotation that occurs when a receiver or transmitter changes orientation while observing or emitting circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. This model extends work detailing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) carrier phase wind-up to allow us to describe the interaction of changing satellite orientation with phase rotation in observing radio telescopes. This development is motivated by, and a critical requirement of, unifying GNSS and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements at the observation level. The model can be used for either stationary choke ring antennas or steerable radio telescopes observing either natural radio sources or satellites. Simulations and experimental data are used to validate the model and to illustrate its importance. In addition, we rigorously lay out the feed rotation correction for radio telescopes with beam waveguide and full Nasmyth focuses and validate the correction by observing the effect with dual polarization observations. Using this feed rotation model for beam waveguide telescopes, we produce the first phase delay solution for the VLBI baseline WARK30M-WARK12M. We provide a practical guide to using the feed rotation model in Appendix D.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images with Spatially Varying Backgrounds and Point Spread Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a type of amortized variational inference, is a computationally efficient means of constructing probabilistic catalogs of light sources from astronomical images. To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Reconstruction of Large-Scale Structure from Combined Photometric and Spectroscopic Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy surveys are crucial for studying large-scale structure (LSS) and cosmology, yet they face limitations--imaging surveys provide extensive sky coverage but suffer from photo-$z$ uncertainties, while spectroscopic surveys yield precise redshifts but are sample-limited. To take advantage of both photo-$z$ and spec-$z$ data while eliminating photo-$z$ errors, we propose a deep learning framework based on a dual UNet architecture that integrates these two datasets at the field level to reconstruct the 3D photo-$z$ density field. We train the network on mock samples representative of stage-IV spectroscopic surveys, utilizing CosmicGrowth simulations with a $z=0.59$ snapshot containing $2048^3$ particles in a $(1200~h^{-1}\rm Mpc)^3$ volume. Several metrics, including correlation coefficient, MAE, MSE, PSNR, and SSIM, validate the model's accuracy. Moreover, the reconstructed power spectrum closely matches the ground truth at small scales ($k \gtrsim 0.06~h/\rm Mpc$) within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the UNet model significantly improves the estimation of photo-$z$ power spectrum multipoles. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to enhance LSS reconstruction by using both spectroscopic and photometric data.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Convolution Direction and Template Selection for Difference Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Difference image analysis (DIA) is a powerful tool for studying time-variable phenomena, and has been used by many time-domain surveys. Most DIA algorithms involve matching the spatially-varying PSF shape between science and template images, and then convolving that shape in one image to match the other. The wrong choice of which image to convolve can introduce one of the largest sources of artifacts in the final difference image. We introduce a quantitative metric to determine the optimal convolution direction that depends not only on the sharpness of the images measured by their FWHM, but also on their exposure depths. With this metric, the optimal convolution direction can be determined a priori, depending only on the FWHM and depth of the images. This not only simplifies the process, but also makes it more robust and less prone to creating sub-optimal difference images due to the wrong choice of the convolution direction. As an additional benefit, for a large set of images, we define a Figure-of-Merit based on this metric, which allows us to rank a list of images and determine the ones best suited to be used as templates, thus streamlining and automating the data reduction process.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first sensitivity estimates to GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter, predicting Hyper-K can reach spin dependent cross sections as low as $\sigma_{p\chi}^{\mathrm{SD}}=2\times 10^{-35}\mathrm{cm}^2$ for DM masses below 2 GeV. This surpasses current solar limits and direct detection results. We additionally provide estimates for Super-K ORCA, and the IceCube-Upgrade, showing that these experiments could provide complimentary bounds to direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Primary Beam Chromaticity in HIRAX: I. Characterization from Simulations and Power Spectrum Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is an upcoming radio interferometric telescope designed to constrain dark energy through the 21cm intensity mapping of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Instrumental systematics must be controlled and carefully characterized to measure the 21cm power spectrum with fidelity and achieve high-precision constraints on the cosmological parameters. The chromaticity of the primary beam is one such complicated systematic, which can leak the power of spectrally smooth foregrounds beyond the ideal horizon limits due to the complex spatial and spectral structures of the sidelobes and the mainlobe. This paper studies the chromaticity of the HIRAX Stokes I primary beam and its effects on accurate measurements of the 21cm power spectrum. To investigate the effect of chromaticity in the 21cm power spectrum, we present a physically motivated beam modeling technique, which uses a flexible basis derived from traditional optics that can account for higher-order radial and azimuthal structures in the primary beam. We investigate the impact of imperfect knowledge of the mainlobe and sidelobes chromaticity in the power spectrum space by subtracting a simple foreground model in simulated snapshot visibilities to recover the H$\textsc{i}$ power spectrum. Additionally, we find that modeling up to the octupolar azimuthal order feature (fourth-order angular variation) in the primary beam is sufficient to reduce the leakage outside the wedge with minimal bias.</description>

      <title>An Independent Search for Small Long-period Planets in Kepler Data I: Detection Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented photometric precision of Kepler mission allows searching for Earth-like planets. However, it remains difficult to distinguish these low signal-to-noise planets from the false alarms originating from correlated and non-Gaussian noise. It reduces the resulting planetary catalog reliability and makes it hard to measure the occurrence rate of small long-period planets. We aim to obtain a more reliable catalog of small long-period planet candidates from Kepler data and use it to improve their occurrence rate estimate. This work develops an independent search pipeline for small (Kepler Multiple-Event Statistic, MES$\lesssim$12) long-period (50-500 days) planets. It designs and implements a detection statistic that takes into account noise non-Gaussianity and physical prior. For every threshold-crossing event, it runs permutation and injection procedures to calculate the probability of it being caused by a real planet. The provided detection statistic has a tail-less background distribution with a rate of ~1 false alarm per search for MES~7.8. We demonstrate the increase in detection efficiency for MES of ~7.5-9 and $&gt;$4 transits due to the background distribution control. The pipeline was tested to be able to detect most of the faint Confirmed Kepler planets. The pipeline was applied to the entirety of Kepler data and detected ~50 candidate events with a high probability of originating from real planets, which will be presented in our future work.</description>

      <title>Improved upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at $z=17.0$ and $z=20.3$ from an optimal field observed with NenuFAR</title>

Abstract: We report the deepest upper limits to date on the power spectrum of the 21-cm signal during the Cosmic Dawn (redshifts: $z&gt;15$), using four nights of observations with NenuFAR. The limits are derived from two redshift bins, centred at $z=20.3$ and $z=17.0$, with integration times of 26.1 h and 23.6 h, from observations of an optimal target field chosen to minimise sidelobe leakage from bright sources. Our analysis incorporates improvements to the data processing pipeline, particularly in subtracting strong radio sources in the primary beam sidelobes and mitigating low-level radio frequency interference, yielding a 50-fold reduction in the excess variance compared to a previous analysis of the north celestial pole field. At $z=20.3$, we achieve a best $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^{2}_{21}&lt;4.6 \times 10^5 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.038$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, while at $z=17.0$, the best limit is $\Delta^{2}_{21}&lt;5.0 \times 10^6 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.041$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$. These are the strongest constraints on the 21-cm power spectrum at the respective redshifts, with the limit at $z = 20.3$ being deeper by more than an order of magnitude over all previous Cosmic Dawn power spectrum limits. Comparison against simulated exotic 21-cm signals shows that while the $z=20.3$ limits begin to exclude the most extreme models predicting signals stronger than the EDGES detection, an order-of-magnitude improvement would constrain signals compatible with EDGES. A coherence analysis reveals that the excess variance is largely incoherent across nights for the $z=20.3$ redshift bin, suggesting that deeper integrations could yield significantly stronger constraints on the 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>A water Cherenkov detector prototype for future high-energy tau-neutrino experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy tau neutrinos remains a critical challenge in neutrino astronomy, limited by inadequate angular resolution and sensitivity in current detectors like IceCube and KM3NeT. We present a modular water Cherenkov detector prototype optimized for tau-neutrino-induced extensive air showers (EAS) in the 1-100 PeV range, leveraging canyon terrain for natural cosmic-ray shielding. Laboratory validation demonstrates this prototype design has high detection efficiency (&gt;99%) and timing resolution (&lt;2 ns) on MIP particles, enabling precise tau-neutrino-induced EAS reconstruction for future study. The results establish a foundation of a low-cost, scalable neutrino observatory, advancing flavor ratio measurements and cosmic-ray origin problems.</description>
