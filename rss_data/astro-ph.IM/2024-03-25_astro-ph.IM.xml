      <title>A Classifier-Based Approach to Multi-Class Anomaly Detection for Astronomical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating real-time anomaly detection is essential for identifying rare transients in the era of large-scale astronomical surveys. Modern survey telescopes are generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are projected to increase this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, which are then coupled with standard machine learning anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach to detecting anomalies: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method, named Multi-Class Isolation Forests (MCIF), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from the latent space representation given by the classifier. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for interpolation in light curves and helps the neural network model inter-passband relationships and handle irregular sampling. Our anomaly detection pipeline identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations that matched the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common transients), our method was able to discover $41\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall) after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection.</description>

Abstract: The rapid launch of hundreds of thousands of satellites into Low Earth Orbit will significantly alter our view of the sky and raise concerns about the sustainability of Earth's orbital space.

      <title>A Comparative Study of TESS Light Curve Extraction Methods Applied to Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blazars are characterized by largely aperiodic variability on timescales ranging from minutes to decades across the electromagnetic spectrum. The TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission provides continuous sampling of blazar variability on timescales ranging from tens of minutes to 27 days for a single sector observation. Proper removal of the background, thermal ramping, and onboard systematic effects are crucial to the extraction of a reliable blazar light curve. Multiple publicly available procedures have been created to correct for these effects. Using ground based observations from the Zwicky Transit Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) as ``ground truth'' observations, we compare 6 different methods (Regression, Cotrending Basis Vectors (CBV), Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD), eleanor, quaver, and simple differential photometry (SDP)) to each other, and to our ``ground truth'' observations, to identify which methods properly correct light curves of a sample of 11 bright blazars, including the suspected neutrino source TXS~0506+056. In addition to comparing the resulting light curves, we compare the slopes of the power spectral densities, perform least-square fitting to simultaneous ZTF data, and quantify other statistical qualities generated from the light curves of each method. We find that only three of the six methods compared (Simple Differential Photometry, eleanor, and quaver) produce TESS light curves consistent with the ground-based ZTF and ATLAS observations.</description>

      <title>Fast likelihood-free inference in the LSS Stage IV era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forthcoming large-scale structure (LSS) Stage IV surveys will provide us with unprecedented data to probe the nature of dark matter and dark energy. However, analysing these data with conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods will be challenging, due to the increase in the number of nuisance parameters and the presence of intractable likelihoods. In light of this, we present the first application of Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE) (a recent approach in simulation-based inference) to LSS photometric probes: weak lensing, galaxy clustering and the cross-correlation power spectra. In order to analyse the hundreds of spectra simultaneously, we find that a pre-compression of data using principal component analysis, as well as parameter-specific data summaries lead to highly accurate results. Using expected Stage IV experimental noise, we are able to recover the posterior distribution for the cosmological parameters with a speedup factor of $\sim 40-60$ compared to classical MCMC methods. To illustrate that the performance of MNRE is not impeded when posteriors are highly non-Gaussian, we test a scenario of two-body decaying dark matter, finding that Stage IV surveys can improve current bounds on the model by up to one order of magnitude. This result supports that MNRE is a powerful framework to constrain the standard cosmological model and its extensions with next-generation LSS surveys.</description>

      <title>Background information: a study on the sensitivity of astrophysical gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass compact binary mergers are too weak to be individually detected with present-day instruments and instead contribute to a faint, persistent background. This astrophysical background is targeted by searches that model the gravitational-wave ensemble collectively with a small set of parameters. The traditional search models the background as a stochastic field and estimates its amplitude by cross-correlating data from multiple interferometers. A different search uses gravitational-wave templates to marginalize over all individual event parameters and measure the duty cycle and population properties of binary mergers. Both searches ultimately estimate the total merger rate of compact binaries and are expected to yield a detection in the coming years. Given the conceptual and methodological differences between them, though, it is not well understood how their results should be mutually interpreted. In this paper, we use the Fisher information to study the implications of a background detection in terms of which region of the Universe each approach probes. Specifically, we quantify how information about the compact binary merger rate is accumulated by each search as a function of the event redshift. For the LIGO Design sensitivity and a uniform-in-comoving-volume distribution of equal-mass 30M_sol binaries, the traditional cross-correlation search obtains 99% of its information from binaries up to redshift 2.5 (average signal-to-noise-ratio &lt;8), and the template-based search from binaries up to redshift 1.0 (average signal-to-noise-ratio ~8). While we do not calculate the total information accumulated by each search, our analysis emphasizes the need to pair any claimed detection of the stochastic background with an assessment of which binaries contribute to said detection.</description>

      <title>The Dissolution of Planetesimals in Electrostatic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetesimals or smaller bodies in protoplanetary disks are often considered to form as pebble piles in current planet formation models. They are supposed to be large but loose, weakly bound clusters of more robust dust aggregates. This makes them easy prey for destructive processes. In microgravity experiments, we apply strong electric fields on clusters of slightly conductive dust aggregates. We find that this generates enough tensile stress on the fragile clusters to sequentially rip off the aggregates from the cluster. These experiments imply that electric fields in protoplanetary disks can dissolve pebble pile planetesimals. This process might induce a bias for the local planetesimal reservoir in regions with strong fields. Planetesimals prevail with certain kinds of compositions where they are either good isolators or compacted bodies. The less lucky ones generate pebble clouds which might be observable as signposts of electrostatic activity in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Global Analysis of LISA Data with Galactic Binaries and Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. This frequency band is expected to be dominated by signals from millions of Galactic binaries and tens of merging massive black hole binaries. The LISA Data Challenge 2a is focused on the robust signal extraction from a blend of these two types of gravitational wave signals. Here, we introduce a novel high performance and cost-effective global fit pipeline extracting and characterizing galactic binary and massive black hole binary signals and estimate the noise of the residual. We preform the pipeline in a time-evolving weekly analysis starting with and observation time of 1 week until we reach a full year. As expected we detect more galactic binaries and massive black hole binaries bringing the noise estimate of the residual closer to the instrument noise by each week of additional observation time. Furthermore, we present a novel maximum likelihood estimate-based algorithm for extracting multiple massive black hole binaries. Additionally we demonstrate a massive black hole binary signal extraction with a more accurate LISA response, considering higher harmonic modes, in a noisy data set.</description>

      <title>Simulation of radio signals from cosmic-ray cascades in air and ice as observed by in-ice Askaryan radio detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new generation of neutrino observatories, including RNO-G and RET, will search for PeV-EeV neutrinos interacting in the ice by detecting radio pulses. Extended air showers propagating into the ice will form an important background and could be a valuable calibration signal. We present results from a Monte-Carlo simulation framework developed to fully simulate radio emission from cosmic-ray particle cascades as observed by in-ice radio detectors in the polar regions. The framework involves a modified version of CoREAS (a module of CORSIKA 7) to simulate in-air radio emission and a GEANT4-based framework for simulating in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray showers as observed by in-ice antennas. The particles that reach the surface of the polar ice sheet at the end of the CORSIKA 7 simulation are injected into the GEANT4-based shower simulation code that takes the particles and propagates them further into the ice sheet, using an exponential density profile for the ice. The framework takes into account curved ray paths caused by the exponential refractive index profiles of air and ice. We present the framework and discuss some key features of the radio signal and radio shower footprint for in-ice observers.</description>

      <title>Generation of realistic input parameters for simulating atmospheric point-spread functions at astronomical observatories</title>

Abstract: High-fidelity simulated astronomical images are an important tool in developing and measuring the performance of image-processing algorithms, particularly for high precision measurements of cosmic shear -- correlated distortions of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing caused by the large-scale mass distribution in the Universe. For unbiased measurements of cosmic shear, all other sources of correlated image distortions must be modeled or removed. One such source is the correlated blurring of images due to optical turbulence in the atmosphere, which dominates the point-spread function (PSF) for ground-based instruments. In this work, we leverage data from weather forecasting models to produce wind speeds and directions, and turbulence parameters, that are realistically correlated with altitude. To study the resulting correlations in the size and shape of the PSF, we generate simulated images of the PSF across a ~10 square-degree field of view -- the size of the camera focal plane for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile -- using weather data and historical seeing for a geographic location near the Observatory. We make quantitative predictions for two-point correlation functions (2PCF) that are used in analyses of cosmic shear. We observe a strong anisotropy in the two-dimensional 2PCF, which is expected based on observations in real images, and study the dependence of the orientation of the anisotropy on dominant wind directions near the ground and at higher altitudes.
  The code repository for producing the correlated weather parameters for input to simulations (psf-weather-station) is public at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/psf-weather-station.</description>

      <title>RFI Detection with Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting and mitigating Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is critical for enabling and maximising the scientific output of radio telescopes. The emergence of machine learning methods has led to their application in radio astronomy, and in RFI detection. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological systems, are well-suited for processing spatio-temporal data. This study introduces the first exploratory application of SNNs to an astronomical data-processing task, specifically RFI detection. We adapt the nearest-latent-neighbours (NLN) algorithm and auto-encoder architecture proposed by previous authors to SNN execution by direct ANN2SNN conversion, enabling simplified downstream RFI detection by sampling the naturally varying latent space from the internal spiking neurons. Our subsequent evaluation aims to determine whether SNNs are viable for future RFI detection schemes. We evaluate detection performance with the simulated HERA telescope and hand-labelled LOFAR observation dataset the original authors provided. We additionally evaluate detection performance with a new MeerKAT-inspired simulation dataset that provides a technical challenge for machine-learnt RFI detection methods. This dataset focuses on satellite-based RFI, an increasingly important class of RFI and is an additional contribution. Our approach remains competitive with existing methods in AUROC, AUPRC and F1 scores for the HERA dataset but exhibits difficulty in the LOFAR and Tabascal datasets. Our method maintains this accuracy while completely removing the compute and memory-intense latent sampling step found in NLN. This work demonstrates the viability of SNNs as a promising avenue for machine-learning-based RFI detection in radio telescopes by establishing a minimal performance baseline on traditional and nascent satellite-based RFI sources and is the first work to our knowledge to apply SNNs in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Swarm-intelligent search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement an eccentric search for compact binary mergers based on particle swarm optimization. Orbital eccentricity is an invaluable input for understanding the formation scenarios of the binary mergers and can play a pivotal role in finding their electromagnetic counterparts. Current modelled searches rely on pre-computed template banks that are computationally expensive and resistant towards expanding the search parameter space dimensionality. On the other hand, particle swarm optimization offers a straightforward algorithm that dynamically selects template points while exploring an arbitrary dimensional parameter space. Through extensive evaluation using simulated signals from spin-aligned eccentric binary mergers, we discovered that the search exhibits a remarkable autonomy in capturing the effects of both eccentricity and spin. We describe our search pipeline and revisit some of the merger candidates from the gravitational wave transient catalogs.</description>

      <title>Neural style transfer of weak lensing mass maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new generative model of projected cosmic mass density maps inferred from weak gravitational lensing observations of distant galaxies (weak lensing mass maps). We construct the model based on a neural style transfer so that it can transform Gaussian weak lensing mass maps into deeply non-Gaussian counterparts as predicted in ray-tracing lensing simulations. We develop an unpaired image-to-image translation method with Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle GAN), which learn efficient mapping from an input domain to a target domain. Our model is designed to enjoy important advantages; it is trainable with no need for paired simulation data, flexible to make the input domain visually meaningful, and expandable to rapidly-produce a map with a larger sky coverage than training data without additional learning. Using 10,000 lensing simulations, we find that appropriate labeling of training data based on field variance requires the model to exhibit a desired diversity of various summary statistics for weak lensing mass maps. Compared with a popular log-normal model, our model improves in predicting the statistical natures of three-point correlations and local properties of rare high-density regions. We also demonstrate that our model enables us to produce a continuous map with a sky coverage of $\sim166\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ but similar non-Gaussian features to training data covering $\sim12\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ in a GPU minute. Hence, our model can be beneficial to massive productions of synthetic weak lensing mass maps, which is of great importance in future precise real-world analyses.</description>

Abstract: S$H_0$ES $VI$-band photometry for classical Cepheids in the keystone galaxy NGC4258 yield discrepant absolute magnitudes. Specifically, the 2016 and 2022 published S$H_0$ES Cepheid data for NGC4258 exhibit a substantial offset of $\Delta W_{0,VI}\simeq0^{\rm m}.3$. That adds to a suite of existing concerns associated with the S$H_0$ES analysis, which in sum imply that their relatively non-changing Hubble constant for nearly twenty years warrants scrutiny.</description>

      <title>Moving Towards Automated Interstellar Boundary Explorer Data Selection with LOTUS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite collects data on energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that provide insight into the heliosphere, the region surrounding our solar system and separating it from interstellar space. IBEX collects information on these particles and on extraneous ``background'' particles. While IBEX records how and when the different particles are observed, it does not distinguish between heliospheric ENA particles and incidental background particles. To address this issue, all IBEX data has historically been manually labeled as ``good'' ENA data, or ``bad'' background data. This manual culling process is incredibly time-intensive and contingent on subjective, manually-induced decision thresholds. In this paper, we develop a three-stage automated culling process, called LOTUS, that uses random forests to expedite and standardize the labelling process. In Stage 1, LOTUS uses random forests to obtain probabilities of observing true ENA particles on a per-observation basis. In Stage 2, LOTUS aggregates these probabilities to obtain predictions within small windows of time. In Stage 3, LOTUS refines these predictions. We compare the labels generated by LOTUS to those manually generated by the subject matter expert. We use various metrics to demonstrate that LOTUS is a useful automated process for supplementing and standardizing the manual culling process.</description>
