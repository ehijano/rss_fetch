      <title>Tensor network methods for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on fine grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its generalisations to dissipative and dipolar gases have been very useful in describing dynamics of cold atomic gases, as well as polaritons and other nonlinear systems. For some of these applications the numerically accessible grid spacing can become a limiting factor, especially in describing turbulent dynamics and short-range effects of dipole-dipole interactions. We explore the application of tensor networks to these systems, where (in analogy to related work in fluid and plasma dynamics), they allow for physically motivated data compression that makes simulations possible on large spatial grids which would be unfeasible with direct numerical simulations. Analysing different non-equilibrium cases involving vortex formation, we find that these methods are particularly efficient, especially in combination with a matrix product operator representation of the quantum Fourier transform, which enables a spectral approach to calculation of both equilibrium states and time-dependent dynamics. The efficiency of these methods has interesting physical implications for the structure in the states that are generated by these dynamics, and provides a path to describe cold gas experiments that are challenging for existing methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a dark soliton in a curved 1D Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of dark solitons in a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a curved geometry. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in curvilinear coordinates and a perturbative expansion in the local curvature, we derive a set of coupled evolution equations for the soliton velocity and the curvature. For the case of constant curvature, such as circular geometries, the soliton dynamics is governed solely by the initial velocity and curvature. Remarkably, the soliton travels a nearly constant angular trajectory across two orders of magnitude in curvature, suggesting an emergent conserved quantity, independent of its initial velocity. We extend our analysis to elliptical trajectories with spatially varying curvature and show that soliton dynamics remain determined by the local curvature profile. In these cases, the model of effective constant curvature describes accurately the dynamics given the local curvature has smooth variation. When the soliton crosses regions of rapid curvature variation and/or non-monotonic behavior, the model fails to describe to soliton dynamics, although the overall behavior can still be fully mapped to the curvature profile. Our results provide a quantitative framework for understanding the role of geometry in soliton dynamics and pave the way for future studies of nonlinear excitations in curved quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional Shapiro steps in a Cavity-Coupled Josephson ring condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson effect presents a fundamental example of macroscopic quantum coherence as well as a crucial enabler for metrology (e.g. voltage standard), sensing (e.g. Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) and quantum information processing (Josephson qubits). Recently, there has been a major renewal of interest in the effect, following its observation in Bose, Fermi, and dipolar atomic condensates, in exciton-polariton condensates, and in momentum space. We present theoretically a nondestructive, \textit{in situ} and real time protocol for observing the AC and DC Josephson effects including integer (recently observed in cold atoms) and fractional (hitherto unobserved in cold atoms) Shapiro steps, using a ring condensate coupled to an optical cavity. Our analysis presents a metrology standard that does not require measurmement of atomic number and that challenges the conventional wisdom that quantum computations cannot be observed without being destroyed. Our results have implications for the fields of atomtronics, sensing, metrology and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Impurity immersed in a two-component few-fermion mixture in a one-dimensional harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional three-component few-fermion mixture confined in a parabolic external trap, where one component contains a single particle acting as an impurity. Focusing on the many-body ground state, we analyze how the interactions between the impurity and the other components influence the system's structure. For fixed interaction strengths within the mixture, we identify a critical interaction strength with the impurity for which the system undergoes a structural transition characterized by substantial change in its spatial features. We explore this transition from the point of view of correlations and ground-state susceptibility. We remarkably find that this transition exhibits unique universality features not previously observed in other systems, highlighting novel many-body properties existing in multi-component fermionic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates and Less Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>String Breaking Dynamics and Glueball Formation in a $2+1$D Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between two static charges in the $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields, we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and trapped-ion quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of long-range order in low-dimensional nonequilibrium $O(N)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now well established that the Mermin-Wagner theorem can be circumvented in nonequilibrium systems, allowing for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry and the emergence of long-range order in low dimensions. However, only a few models demonstrating this violation are known, and they often rely on specific mechanisms that may not be generally applicable. In this work, we identify a new mechanism for nonequilibrium-induced long-range order in a class of $O(N)$-symmetric models. Inspired by the role of long-range spatial interactions in equilibrium, consider the effect of non-Markovian dissipation, in stabilizing long range order in low-dimensional nonequilibrium systems. We find that this alone is insufficient, but the interplay of non-Markovian dissipation and slow modes due to conservation laws can effectively suppress fluctuations and stabilize long-range order.</description>

      <title>Interaction induced moir\'e systems in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e related physics in twisted bilayer two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted widespread interest in condensed matter physics. Simulation of moir\'e related physics in cold atom platform is expected to outperform the 2D materials thanks to its advantage of higher tunablility. Here, we demonstrate that, the cold atom platform enables a new mechanism of moir\'e lattice formation, induced by interlayer interaction with intrinsic "dynamical" character, in contrast to conventional moir\'e lattice induced by "static" ways such as single-particle interlayer tunneling. Specifically, we consider a twisted bilayer Bose-Hubbard model with vanishing interlayer tunneling, and the bilayer is solely coupled through interlayer interaction that originates from contact interaction of atoms. We find that this system hosts a plethora of novel phases unique to this dynamical lattice, including a variety of Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid (SF) phases either preserving or breaking moir\'e lattice symmetry, phases with one layer in SF and the other in MI, "interlocked" MI, and self-localized phases at commensurate twist angles, which exhibits the characteristics of Bose glass and quasi-many-body localization in the absence of (quasi)disorder or quasicrystalline lattices. Our prediction can be readily observed in current experimental setup of twisted bilayer optical lattices, opening up new avenues for exploring the rich physics of interaction induced moir\'e systems in cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov turbulence in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated turbulence in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) using a minimally destructive, impurity injection technique analogous to particle image velocimetry in conventional fluids. Our approach transfers small regions of the BEC into a different hyperfine state, and tracks their displacement ultimately yielding the velocity field. This allows us to quantify turbulence in the same way as conventional in fluid dynamics in terms of velocity-velocity correlation functions called velocity structure functions that obey a Kolmogorov scaling law. Furthermore the velocity increments show a clear fat-tail non-Gaussian distribution that results from intermittency corrections to the initial "K41" Kolmogorov theory. Our observations are fully consistent with the later "KO62" description. These results are validated by a 2D dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii simulation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic transition of the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model: multi-particles and inter-particle interaction effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How environments affect dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum boson modes. Previous analytic solution shows that, starting from the initial state that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamic transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here, we study the dynamic transition for the case that $N$ particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. In particular, we access the effects of an all to all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the non-perturbative time-dependent numerical renormalization group method. We find that the critical coupling for the transition decreases with $N$, and is suppressed (enlarged) by the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding on environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Microsecond-scale high-survival and number-resolved detection of ytterbium atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a large family of one-dimensional (1D) topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ invariants protected by space-time inversion symmetry. This finding stands in marked contrast to the conventional classification of 1D band topology protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-quantized polarization (Berry-Zak phase). Such kind of enriched topological phases relies on imposing restriction on tunneling forms. By considering the nontrivial relative polarization among sublattices (orbitals), we introduce the inversion winding number as a topological invariant for characterizing and categorizing band topology. The bulk-edge correspondence with regard to the inversion winding number is discussed. Leveraging real-space analysis, we discover disorder-induced topological Anderson insulators and propose to experimentally distinguish band topology through relative polarization of edge states or bulk states. Our comprehensive findings present a paradigmatic illustration for the ongoing investigation and classification of band topology in TCIs.</description>

      <title>Continuously trapped matter-wave interferometry in magic Floquet-Bloch band structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate a novel Floquet-engineered platform for compact, continuously trapped atom interferometry which is intrinsically robust against trap noise and beamsplitter pulse duration. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.</description>
