      <title>Reliability of Capacitive Read in Arrays of Ferroelectric Capacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-destructive capacitance read-out of ferroelectric capacitors (FeCaps) based on doped HfO$_2$ metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) structures offers the potential for low-power and highly scalable crossbar arrays. This is due to a number of factors, including the selector-less design, the absence of sneak paths, the power-efficient charge-based read operation, and the reduced IR drop. Nevertheless, a reliable capacitive readout presents certain challenges, particularly in regard to device variability and the trade-off between read yield and read disturbances, which can ultimately result in bit-flips. This paper presents a digital read macro for HfO$_2$ FeCaps and provides design guidelines for capacitive readout of HfO$_2$ FeCaps, taking device-centric reliability and yield challenges into account. An experimentally calibrated physics-based compact model of HfO$_2$ FeCaps is employed to investigate the reliability of the read-out operation of the FeCap macro through Monte Carlo simulations. Based on this analysis, we identify limitations posed by the device variability and propose potential mitigation strategies through design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) of the FeCap device characteristics and the CMOS circuit design. Finally, we examine the potential applications of the FeCap macro in the context of secure hardware. We identify potential security threats and propose strategies to enhance the robustness of the system.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hypergraph Partitioning of Quantum Circuits with Hybrid Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for a range of computational problems. The fundamental mechanisms underlying quantum computation required the development and construction of quantum computers. These devices are referred to as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices. Not only are NISQ devices extremely limited in their qubit count but they also suffer from noise during computation and this problem only gets worse as the size of the circuit increases which limits the practical use of quantum computers for modern day applications. This paper will focus on utilizing quantum circuit partitioning to overcome the inherent issues of NISQ devices. Partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits has allowed for the execution of quantum circuits that are too large to fit on one quantum device. There have been many previous approaches to quantum circuit partitioning and each of these approaches differ in how they work with some focusing on hardware-aware partitioning, optimal graph-based partitioning, multi-processor architectures and many more. These approaches achieve success in their objective but they often fail to scale well which impacts cost and noise. The ultimate goal of this paper is to mitigate these issues by minimizing 3 important metrics; noise, time and cost. To achieve this we use dynamic partitioning for practical circuit cutting and we take advantage of the benefits of hybrid execution where classical computation will be used alongside quantum hardware. This approach has proved to be beneficial with respect to noise with classical execution enabling a 42.30% reduction in noise and a 40% reduction in the number of qubits required in cases where a mixture of classical and quantum computation were required.</description>

      <title>Understanding Human-AI Trust in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09160</link>

Abstract: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots (human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education.</description>

      <title>Towards Full-Scenario Safety Evaluation of Automated Vehicles: A Volume-Based Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of automated vehicles (AVs) in recent years, commercially available AVs are increasingly demonstrating high-level automation capabilities. However, most existing AV safety evaluation methods are primarily designed for simple maneuvers such as car-following and lane-changing. While suitable for basic tests, these methods are insufficient for assessing high-level automation functions deployed in more complex environments. First, these methods typically use crash rate as the evaluation metric, whose accuracy heavily depends on the quality and completeness of naturalistic driving environment data used to estimate scenario probabilities. Such data is often difficult and expensive to collect. Second, when applied to diverse scenarios, these methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, making large-scale evaluation computationally intractable. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for full-scenario AV safety evaluation. A unified model is first introduced to standardize the representation of diverse driving scenarios. This modeling approach constrains the dimension of most scenarios to a regular highway setting with three lanes and six surrounding background vehicles, significantly reducing dimensionality. To further avoid the limitations of probability-based method, we propose a volume-based evaluation method that quantifies the proportion of risky scenarios within the entire scenario space. For car-following scenarios, we prove that the set of safe scenarios is convex under specific settings, enabling exact volume computation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed volume-based method using both AV behavior models from existing literature and six production AV models calibrated from field-test trajectory data in the Ultra-AV dataset. Code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Cloud-based ARM SVE for Zero-Knowledge Proving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) are becoming a gold standard in scaling blockchains and bringing Web3 to life. At the same time, ZKP for transactions running on the Ethereum Virtual Machine require powerful servers with hundreds of CPU cores. The current zkProver implementation from Polygon is optimized for x86-64 CPUs by vectorizing key operations, such as Merkle tree building with Poseidon hashes over the Goldilocks field, with Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX and AVX512). With these optimizations, a ZKP for a batch of transactions is generated in less than two minutes. With the advent of cloud servers with ARM which are at least 10% cheaper than x86-64 servers and the implementation of ARM Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), we wonder if ARM servers can take over their x86-64 counterparts. Unfortunately, our analysis shows that current ARM CPUs are not a match for their x86-64 competitors. Graviton4 from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Axion from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are 1.6X and 1.4X slower compared to the latest AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon servers from AWS with AVX and AVX512, respectively, when building a Merkle tree with over four million leaves. This low performance is due to (1) smaller vector size in these ARM CPUs (128 bits versus 512 bits in AVX512) and (2) lower clock frequency. On the other hand, ARM SVE/SVE2 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is at least as powerful as AVX/AVX512 but more flexible. Moreover, we estimate that increasing the vector size to 512 bits will enable higher performance in ARM CPUs compared to their x86-64 counterparts while maintaining their price advantage.</description>

      <title>Mainframe-style channel controllers for modern disaggregated memory systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or "far" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.
  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.
  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.</description>

      <title>Spatial-RAG: Spatial Retrieval Augmented Generation for Real-World Geospatial Reasoning Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18470v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Answering real-world geospatial questions--such as finding restaurants along a travel route or amenities near a landmark--requires reasoning over both geographic relationships and semantic user intent. However, existing large language models (LLMs) lack spatial computing capabilities and access to up-to-date, ubiquitous real-world geospatial data, while traditional geospatial systems fall short in interpreting natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spatial-RAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed for geospatial question answering. Spatial-RAG integrates structured spatial databases with LLMs via a hybrid spatial retriever that combines sparse spatial filtering and dense semantic matching. It formulates the answering process as a multi-objective optimization over spatial and semantic relevance, identifying Pareto-optimal candidates and dynamically selecting the best response based on user intent. Experiments across multiple tourism and map-based QA datasets show that Spatial-RAG significantly improves accuracy, precision, and ranking performance over strong baselines.</description>

      <title>A Replica for our Democracies? On Using Digital Twins to Enhance Deliberative Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deliberative democracy depends on carefully designed institutional frameworks, such as participant selection, facilitation methods, and decision-making mechanisms, that shape how deliberation performs. However, identifying optimal institutional designs for specific contexts remains challenging when relying solely on real-world observations or laboratory experiments: they can be expensive, ethically and methodologically tricky, or too limited in scale to give us clear answers. Computational experiments offer a complementary approach, enabling researchers to conduct large-scale investigations while systematically analyzing complex dynamics, emergent and unexpected collective behavior, and risks or opportunities associated with novel democratic designs. Therefore, this paper explores Digital Twin (DT) technology as a computational testing ground for deliberative systems (with potential applicability to broader institutional analysis). By constructing dynamic models that simulate real-world deliberation, DTs allow researchers and policymakers to rigorously test "what-if" scenarios across diverse institutional configurations in a controlled virtual environment. This approach facilitates evidence-based assessment of novel designs using synthetically generated data, bypassing the constraints of real-world or lab-based experimentation, and without societal disruption. The paper also discusses the limitations of this new methodological approach and suggests where future research should focus.</description>
