      <title>AIvilization v0: Toward Large-Scale Artificial Social Simulation with a Unified Agent Architecture and Adaptive Agent Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AIvilization v0 is a publicly deployed large-scale artificial society that couples a resource-constrained sandbox economy with a unified LLM-agent architecture, aiming to sustain long-horizon autonomy while remaining executable under rapidly changing environment. To mitigate the tension between goal stability and reactive correctness, we introduce (i) a hierarchical branch-thinking planner that decomposes life goals into parallel objective branches and uses simulation-guided validation plus tiered re-planning to ensure feasibility; (ii) an adaptive agent profile with dual-process memory that separates short-term execution traces from long-term semantic consolidation, enabling persistent yet evolving identity; and (iii) a human-in-the-loop steering interface that injects long-horizon objectives and short commands at appropriate abstraction levels, with effects propagated through memory rather than brittle prompt overrides. The environment integrates physiological survival costs, non-substitutable multi-tier production, an AMM-based price mechanism, and a gated education-occupation system. Using high-frequency transactions from the platforms mature phase, we find stable markets that reproduce key stylized facts (heavy-tailed returns and volatility clustering) and produce structured wealth stratification driven by education and access constraints. Ablations show simplified planners can match performance on narrow tasks, while the full architecture is more robust under multi-objective, long-horizon settings, supporting delayed investment and sustained exploration.</description>

      <title>An Ontology-driven Dynamic Knowledge Base for Uninhabited Ground Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the concept of Dynamic Contextual Mission Data (DCMD) is introduced to develop an ontology-driven dynamic knowledge base for Uninhabited Ground Vehicles (UGVs) at the tactical edge. The dynamic knowledge base with DCMD is added to the UGVs to: support enhanced situation awareness; improve autonomous decision making; and facilitate agility within complex and dynamic environments. As UGVs are heavily reliant on the a priori information added pre-mission, unexpected occurrences during a mission can cause identification ambiguities and require increased levels of user input. Updating this a priori information with contextual information can help UGVs realise their full potential. To address this, the dynamic knowledge base was designed using an ontology-driven representation, supported by near real-time information acquisition and analysis, to provide in-mission on-platform DCMD updates. This was implemented on a team of four UGVs that executed a laboratory based surveillance mission. The results showed that the ontology-driven dynamic representation of the UGV operational environment was machine actionable, producing contextual information to support a successful and timely mission, and contributed directly to the situation awareness.</description>

      <title>Beyond Task Performance: A Metric-Based Analysis of Sequential Cooperation in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Destructive Foraging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of analyzing cooperation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems which operate under partial observability and temporal role dependency, framed within a destructive multi-agent foraging setting. Unlike most previous studies, which focus primarily on algorithmic performance with respect to task completion, this article proposes a systematic set of general-purpose cooperation metrics aimed at characterizing not only efficiency, but also coordination and dependency between teams and agents, fairness, and sensitivity. These metrics are designed to be transferable to different multi-agent sequential domains similar to foraging. The proposed suite of metrics is structured into three main categories that jointly provide a multilevel characterization of cooperation: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics. They have been validated in a realistic destructive foraging scenario inspired by dynamic aquatic surface cleaning using heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. It involves two specialized teams with sequential dependencies: one focused on the search of resources, and another on their destruction. Several representative approaches have been evaluated, covering both learning-based algorithms and classical heuristic paradigms.</description>

      <title>The emergence of numerical representations in communicating artificial agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human languages provide efficient systems for expressing numerosities, but whether the sheer pressure to communicate is enough for numerical representations to arise in artificial agents, and whether the emergent codes resemble human numerals at all, remains an open question. We study two neural network-based agents that must communicate numerosities in a referential game using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches, thus exploring both symbolic and iconic representations. Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous). We conclude that the communication pressure alone suffices for precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed to yield compositional codes and generalisation abilities.</description>

      <title>Learning to Compose for Cross-domain Agentic Workflow Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically generating agentic workflows -- executable operator graphs or codes that orchestrate reasoning, verification, and repair -- has become a practical way to solve complex tasks beyond what single-pass LLM generation can reliably handle. Yet what constitutes a good workflow depends heavily on the task distribution and the available operators. Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects. Across stringent multi-domain, cross-domain, and unseen-domain evaluations, our 1-pass generator surpasses SOTA refinement baselines that consume 20 iterations, while substantially reducing generation latency and cost.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Implement Agent-Based Models? An ODD-based Replication Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now synthesize non-trivial executable code from textual descriptions, raising an important question: can LLMs reliably implement agent-based models from standardized specifications in a way that supports replication, verification, and validation? We address this question by evaluating 17 contemporary LLMs on a controlled ODD-to-code translation task, using the PPHPC predator-prey model as a fully specified reference. Generated Python implementations are assessed through staged executability checks, model-independent statistical comparison against a validated NetLogo baseline, and quantitative measures of runtime efficiency and maintainability. Results show that behaviorally faithful implementations are achievable but not guaranteed, and that executability alone is insufficient for scientific use. GPT-4.1 consistently produces statistically valid and efficient implementations, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet performing well but less reliably. Overall, the findings clarify both the promise and current limitations of LLMs as model engineering tools, with implications for reproducible agent-based and environmental modelling.</description>

      <title>Authenticated Workflows: A Systems Approach to Protecting Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems automate enterprise workflows but existing defenses--guardrails, semantic filters--are probabilistic and routinely bypassed. We introduce authenticated workflows, the first complete trust layer for enterprise agentic AI. Security reduces to protecting four fundamental boundaries: prompts, tools, data, and context. We enforce intent (operations satisfy organizational policies) and integrity (operations are cryptographically authentic) at every boundary crossing, combining cryptographic elimination of attack classes with runtime policy enforcement. This delivers deterministic security--operations either carry valid cryptographic proof or are rejected. We introduce MAPL, an AI-native policy language that expresses agentic constraints dynamically as agents evolve and invocation context changes, scaling as O(log M + N) policies versus O(M x N) rules through hierarchical composition with cryptographic attestations for workflow dependencies. We prove practicality through a universal security runtime integrating nine leading frameworks (MCP, A2A, OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Haystack) through thin adapters requiring zero protocol modifications. Formal proofs establish completeness and soundness. Empirical validation shows 100% recall with zero false positives across 174 test cases, protection against 9 of 10 OWASP Top 10 risks, and complete mitigation of two high impact production CVEs.</description>

      <title>Protecting Context and Prompts: Deterministic Security for Non-Deterministic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) applications are vulnerable to prompt injection and context manipulation attacks that traditional security models cannot prevent. We introduce two novel primitives--authenticated prompts and authenticated context--that provide cryptographically verifiable provenance across LLM workflows. Authenticated prompts enable self-contained lineage verification, while authenticated context uses tamper-evident hash chains to ensure integrity of dynamic inputs. Building on these primitives, we formalize a policy algebra with four proven theorems providing protocol-level Byzantine resistance--even adversarial agents cannot violate organizational policies. Five complementary defenses--from lightweight resource controls to LLM-based semantic validation--deliver layered, preventative security with formal guarantees. Evaluation against representative attacks spanning 6 exhaustive categories achieves 100% detection with zero false positives and nominal overhead. We demonstrate the first approach combining cryptographically enforced prompt lineage, tamper-evident context, and provable policy reasoning--shifting LLM security from reactive detection to preventative guarantees.</description>

      <title>Generalized Langevin Models of Linear Agent-Based Systems: Strategic Influence Through Environmental Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models typically treat systems in isolation, discarding environmental coupling as either computationally prohibitive or dynamically irrelevant. We demonstrate that this neglect misses essential physics: environmental degrees of freedom create memory effects that fundamentally alter system dynamics. By systematically transforming linear update rules into exact generalized Langevin equations, we show that unobserved environmental agents manifest as memory kernels whose timescales and coupling strengths are determined by the environmental interaction spectrum. Network topology shapes this memory structure in distinct ways: small-world rewiring drives dynamics toward a single dominant relaxation mode, while fragmented environments sustain multiple persistent modes corresponding to isolated subpopulations. We apply this framework to covert influence operations where adversaries manipulate target populations exclusively via environmental intermediaries. The steady-state response admits a random-walk interpretation through hitting probabilities, revealing how zealot opinions diffuse through the environment to shift system agent opinions toward the zealot mean - even when zealots never directly contact targets.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Connectivity: Dynamics of Multi-Agent Q-Learning in Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond specific settings, many multi-agent learning algorithms fail to converge to an equilibrium solution, instead displaying complex, non-stationary behaviours such as recurrent or chaotic orbits. In fact, recent literature suggests that such complex behaviours are likely to occur when the number of agents increases. In this paper, we study Q-learning dynamics in network polymatrix normal-form games where the network structure is drawn from classical random graph models. In particular, we focus on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, which is used to analyze connectivity in distributed systems, and the Stochastic Block model, which generalizes the above by accounting for community structures that naturally arise in multi-agent systems. In each setting, we establish sufficient conditions under which the agents' joint strategies converge to a unique equilibrium. We investigate how this condition depends on the exploration rates, payoff matrices and, crucially, the probabilities of interaction between network agents. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations and demonstrate that convergence can be reliably achieved in many-agent systems, provided interactions in the network are controlled.</description>

      <title>LLM-Mediated Guidance of MARL Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex multi-agent environments, achieving efficient learning and desirable behaviours is a significant challenge for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems. This work explores the potential of combining MARL with Large Language Model (LLM)-mediated interventions to guide agents toward more desirable behaviours. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs can be used to interpret and facilitate interventions that shape the learning trajectories of multiple agents. We experimented with two types of interventions, referred to as controllers: a Natural Language (NL) Controller and a Rule-Based (RB) Controller. The RB Controller showed a stronger impact than the NL Controller, which uses a small (7B/8B) LLM to simulate human-like interventions. Our findings indicate that agents particularly benefit from early interventions, leading to more efficient training and higher performance. Both intervention types outperform the baseline without interventions, highlighting the potential of LLM-mediated guidance to accelerate training and enhance MARL performance in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Mapping of the Douro River Plume with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03534v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.</description>

      <title>AOI: Context-Aware Multi-Agent Operations via Dynamic Scheduling and Hierarchical Memory Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of cloud-native architectures, characterized by microservices and dynamic orchestration, has rendered modern IT infrastructures exceedingly complex and volatile. This complexity generates overwhelming volumes of operational data, leading to critical bottlenecks in conventional systems: inefficient information processing, poor task coordination, and loss of contextual continuity during fault diagnosis and remediation. To address these challenges, we propose AOI (AI-Oriented Operations), a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that integrates three specialized agents with an LLM-based Context Compressor. Its core innovations include: (1) a dynamic task scheduling strategy that adaptively prioritizes operations based on real-time system states, (2) a three-layer memory architecture comprising Working, Episodic, and Semantic layers that optimizes context retention and retrieval. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that AOI achieves 72.4\% context compression while preserving 92.8\% critical information, improves task success to 94.2\%, and reduces MTTR by 34.4\% over the best baseline. This work presents a paradigm shift towards scalable, adaptive, and context-aware autonomous operations, enabling robust management of next-generation IT infrastructures with minimal human intervention.</description>

      <title>Learning to Coordinate via Quantum Entanglement in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inability to communicate poses a major challenge to coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Prior work has explored correlating local policies via shared randomness, sometimes in the form of a correlation device, as a mechanism to assist in decentralized decision-making. In contrast, this work introduces the first framework for training MARL agents to exploit shared quantum entanglement as a coordination resource, which permits a larger class of communication-free correlated policies than shared randomness alone. This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP).</description>

      <title>LingxiDiagBench: A Multi-Agent Framework for Benchmarking LLMs in Chinese Psychiatric Consultation and Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental disorders are highly prevalent worldwide, but the shortage of psychiatrists and the inherent subjectivity of interview-based diagnosis create substantial barriers to timely and consistent mental-health assessment. Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions. We release LingxiDiag-16K and the full evaluation framework to support reproducible research at https://github.com/Lingxi-mental-health/LingxiDiagBench.</description>

      <title>Games with Payments between Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In repeated games, such as auctions, players rely on autonomous learning agents to choose their actions. We study settings in which players have their agents make monetary transfers to other agents during play at their own expense, in order to influence learning dynamics in their favor. Our goal is to understand when players have incentives to use such payments, how payments between agents affect learning outcomes, and what the resulting implications are for welfare and its distribution. We propose a simple game-theoretic model to capture the incentive structure of such scenarios. We find that, quite generally, abstaining from payments is not robust to strategic deviations by users of learning agents: self-interested players benefit from having their agents make payments to other learners. In a broad class of games, such endogenous payments between learning agents lead to higher welfare for all players. In first- and second-price auctions, equilibria of the induced "payment-policy game" lead to highly collusive learning outcomes, with low or vanishing revenue for the auctioneer. These results highlight a fundamental challenge for mechanism design, as well as for regulatory policies, in environments where learning agents may interact in the digital ecosystem beyond a mechanism's boundaries.</description>

      <title>On Qualitative Preference in Alternating-time Temporal Logic with Strategy Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to add and eliminate binary preference on plays in Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) with strategy contexts on Concurrent Game Models (CGMs) by means of a translation which preserves satisfaction in models where preference-indiscernibility between plays is an equivalence relation of finite index. The elimination technique also works for a companion second-order path quantifier, which makes quantified path variables range over sets of plays that are closed under preference-indiscernibility. We argue that the preference operator and the specialized quantifier facilitate formulating interesting solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and secure equilibrium in a straightforward way. We also present a novel translation from ATL with strategy contexts to Quantified Computation Tree Logic (QCTL). Together with the translation which eliminates preference and the specialized form of quantification, this translation allows reasoning about infinite multiplayer synchronous games on CGMs to be translated from the proposed extension of ATL with strategy contexts into QCTL. The setting is related to that of ordered objectives in the works of Bouyer, Brenguier, Markey and Ummels, except that our focus is on the use of the temporal logic languages mentioned above, and we rely on translations into QCTL for the algorithmic solutions.</description>

      <title>Code2MCP: Transforming Code Repositories into MCP Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) aims to create a standard for how Large Language Models use tools. However, most current research focuses on selecting tools from an existing pool. A more fundamental, yet largely overlooked, problem is how to populate this pool by converting the vast number of existing software projects into MCP-compatible services. To bridge this gap, we introduce Code2MCP, an agent-based framework that automatically transforms a GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Code2MCP employs a multi-agent workflow for code analysis, environment setup, tool function design, and service generation, enhanced by a self-correcting loop to ensure reliability. We demonstrate that Code2MCP successfully transforms open-source computing libraries in scientific fields such as bioinformatics, mathematics, and fluid dynamics that are not available in existing MCP servers. By providing a novel automated pathway to unlock GitHub, the world's largest code repository, for the MCP ecosystem, Code2MCP serves as a catalyst to significantly accelerate the protocol's adoption and practical application. The code is public at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/Code2MCP.</description>

      <title>AI Driven Discovery of Bio Ecological Mediation in Cascading Heatwave Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compound heatwaves increasingly trigger complex cascading failures that propagate through interconnected physical and human systems, yet the fragmentation of disciplinary knowledge hinders the comprehensive mapping of these systemic risk topologies. This study introduces the Heatwave Discovery Agent HeDA as an autonomous scientific synthesis framework designed to bridge cognitive gaps by constructing a high fidelity knowledge graph from 8,111 academic publications. By structuring 70,297 evidence nodes, the system exhibits enhanced inferential fidelity in capturing long tail risk mechanisms and achieves a significant accuracy margin compared to standard foundation models including GPT 5.2 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in complex reasoning tasks. The resulting topological analysis reveals a critical bio ecological mediation effect where biological systems function as the primary non linear amplifiers of thermal stress that transform physical meteorological hazards into systemic socioeconomic losses. We further identify latent functional couplings between theoretically distinct sectors such as the heat induced synchronization of power grid failures and emergency medical capacity saturation. These findings elucidate the dynamics of compound climate risks and provide an empirical basis for shifting adaptation strategies from static sectoral defense to dynamic cross system resilience.</description>

      <title>The Specification Trap: Why Content-Based AI Value Alignment Cannot Produce Robust Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I argue that content-based AI value alignment--any approach that treats alignment as optimizing toward a formal value-object (reward function, utility function, constitutional principles, or learned preference representation)--cannot, by itself, produce robust alignment under capability scaling, distributional shift, and increasing autonomy. This limitation arises from three philosophical results: Hume's is-ought gap (behavioral data cannot entail normative conclusions), Berlin's value pluralism (human values are irreducibly plural and incommensurable), and the extended frame problem (any value encoding will misfit future contexts that advanced AI creates). I show that RLHF, Constitutional AI, inverse reinforcement learning, and cooperative assistance games each instantiate this specification trap, and that their failure modes are structural, not engineering limitations. Proposed escape routes--continual updating, meta-preferences, moral realism--relocate the trap rather than exit it. Drawing on Fischer and Ravizza's compatibilist theory, I argue that behavioral compliance does not constitute alignment: there is a principled distinction between simulated value-following and genuine reasons-responsiveness, and specification-based methods cannot produce the latter. The specification trap establishes a ceiling on content-based approaches, not their uselessness--but this ceiling becomes safety-critical at the capability frontier. The alignment problem must be reframed from value specification to value emergence.</description>

      <title>Active Evaluation of General Agents: Problem Definition and Comparison of Baseline Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As intelligent agents become more generally-capable, i.e. able to master a wide variety of tasks, the complexity and cost of properly evaluating them rises significantly. Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction.</description>

      <title>Implementing Grassroots Logic Programs with Multiagent Transition Systems and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP) is a concurrent logic programming language with variables partitioned into paired \emph{readers} and \emph{writers}, conjuring both linear logic and futures/promises: an assignment is produced at most once via the sole occurrence of a writer (promise) and consumed at most once via the sole occurrence of its paired reader (future), and may contain additional readers and/or writers, enabling the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities.
  GLP was designed as a language for grassroots platforms -- distributed systems with multiple instances that can operate independently of each other and of any global resource, and can coalesce into ever larger instances -- with its target architecture being smartphones communicating peer-to-peer. The operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP and of multiagent GLP (maGLP) were defined via transition systems/multiagent transition systems, respectively.
  Here, we describe the mathematics developed to facilitate the workstation- and smartphone-based implementations of GLP by AI in Dart. We developed dGLP -- implementation-ready deterministic operational semantics for single-agent GLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the Concurrent GLP operational semantics; dGLP was used by AI as a formal spec, from which it developed a workstation-based implementation of GLP. We developed madGLP -- an implementation-ready multiagent operational semantics for maGLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the maGLP operational semantics; madGLP is deterministic at the agent level (not at the system level due to communication asynchrony), and is being used by AI as a formal spec from which it develops a smartphone-based implementation of maGLP.</description>
