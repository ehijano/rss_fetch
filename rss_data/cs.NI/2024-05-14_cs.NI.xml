      <title>Towards Multi-Task Generative-AI Edge Services with an Attention-based Diffusion DRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging paradigm of content creation, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has been widely adopted by a large number of edge end users. However, the requests for generated content from AIGC users have obvious diversity, and there remains a notable lack of research addressing the variance in user demands for AIGC services. This gap underscores a critical need for suitable AIGC service selection mechanisms satisfying various AIGC user requirements under resource-constrained edge environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Attention-based Diffusion Soft Actor-Critic (ADSAC) algorithm to select the appropriate AIGC model in response to heterogeneous AIGC user requests. Specifically, the ADSAC algorithm integrates a diffusion model as the policy network in the off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) framework, to capture the intricate relationships between the characteristics of AIGC tasks and the integrated edge network states. Furthermore, an attention mechanism is utilized to harness the contextual long-range dependencies present in state feature vectors, enhancing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in enhancing the overall user utility and reducing the crash rate of servers. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed ADSAC algorithm outperforms existing methods, reducing the overall user utility loss and the server crash rate by at least 58.3% and 58.4%, respectively. These results demonstrate our ADSAC algorithm is a robust solution to the challenges of diverse and dynamic user requirements in edge-based AIGC application environments.</description>

      <title>Can 3GPP New Radio Non-Terrestrial Networks Meet the IMT-2020 Requirements for Satellite Radio Interface Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Telecommunication Union defined the requirements for 5G in the International Mobile Telecommunications 2020 (IMT-2020) standard in 2017. Since then, advances in technology and standardization have made the ubiquitous deployment of 5G via satellite a practical possibility, for example, in locations where terrestrial networks (TNs) are not available. However, it may be difficult for satellite networks to achieve the same performance as TNs. To address this, the IMT-2020 requirements for satellite radio interface technology have recently been established. In this paper, these requirements are evaluated through system simulations for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project New Radio non-terrestrial networks with a low Earth orbit satellite. The focus is on the throughput, area traffic capacity, and spectral efficiency requirements. It is observed that the downlink (DL) requirements can be met for user equipment with 2 receive antenna elements. The results also reveal that frequency reuse factor 1 (FRF1) may outperform FRF3 in DL with a dual-antenna setup, which is a surprising finding since FRF3 is typically considered to outperform FRF1 due to better interference reduction. For uplink (UL), 1 transmit antenna is sufficient to meet the requirements by a relatively large margin - a promising result given that UL is generally more demanding.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) framework, emerging as the cornerstone for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile networks, heralds a transformative shift in radio access network architecture. As the adoption of Open RAN accelerates, ensuring its security becomes critical. The RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) plays a central role in Open RAN by improving network efficiency and flexibility. Nevertheless, it also brings about potential security risks that need careful scrutiny. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the current state of RIC security comprehensively. This assessment is essential to gain a profound understanding of the security considerations associated with RIC. This survey combines a comprehensive analysis of RAN security, tracing its evolution from 2G to 5G, with an in-depth exploration of RIC security, marking the first comprehensive examination of its kind in the literature. Real-world security incidents involving RIC are vividly illustrated, providing practical insights. The study evaluates the security implications of the RIC within the 6G Open RAN context, addressing security vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and potential enhancements. It aims to guide stakeholders in the telecom industry toward a secure and dependable telecommunications infrastructure. The article serves as a valuable reference, shedding light on the RIC's crucial role within the broader network infrastructure and emphasizing security's paramount importance. This survey also explores the promising security opportunities that the RIC presents for enhancing network security and resilience in the context of 6G mobile networks. It outlines open issues, lessons learned, and future research directions in the domain of intelligent control in 6G open RAN, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of this dynamic landscape.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Resource Management in Joint Communication and Computing-Embedded SAGIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of the 6G era aims for ubiquitous connectivity, with the integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTN) offering extensive coverage and enhanced capacity. As manufacturing advances and user demands evolve, space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) with computational capabilities emerge as a viable solution for services requiring low latency and high computational power. Resource management within joint communication and computing-embedded SAGIN (JCC-SAGIN) presents greater complexity than traditional terrestrial networks. This complexity arises from the spatiotemporal dynamics of network topology and service demand, the interdependency of large-scale resource variables, and intricate tradeoffs among various performance metrics. Thus, a thorough examination of resource management strategies in JCC-SAGIN is crucial, emphasizing the role of non-terrestrial platforms with processing capabilities in 6G. This paper begins by reviewing the architecture, enabling technologies, and applications in JCC-SAGIN. Then, we offer a detailed overview of resource management modeling and optimization methods, encompassing both traditional optimization approaches and learning-based intelligent decision-making frameworks. Finally, we outline the prospective research directions in JCC-SAGIN.</description>

      <title>SubwayMeshDTN: Exploring Opportunistic Delay Tolerant Routing Protocols when Disseminating Emergency Alerts on a Smart City Subway Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper seeks to understand the effectiveness of using multi-dimensional opportunistic delay-tolerant network (DTN) routing protocols, specifically Epidemic and MaxProp, in the context of New York City (NYC) metropolitan subway network. We examine how efficiently emergency messages spread through mobile, self-configuring, edge-based movement patterns on the train network to understand and propose solutions for improving communication in subterranean environments. Since DTNs are able to store, carry and forward messages through intermediate edges, this paper benchmarks both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth topologies to compare and critically evaluate movement patterns, latency, overheads and delivery rates on pseudo-realistic underground traces. We also show that the accordion effect is predominant in these networks, and therefore, the most effective protocol configurations vary.</description>

      <title>La ROUTOURNE va tourner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segment routing (SR) offers precise control over the paths taken: it specifies a list of detours, called segments, in IP packets. However, the number of detours that can be specified is limited by the hardware. When calculating segment lists, it is therefore necessary to limit their size. Although solutions have been proposed for calculating these lists, they lack generality and are not always optimal or efficient. We present ROUTOURNE, a method for diverting routing algorithms so that they calculate, not simply an optimal physical path to be translated into a list of segments a posteriori (with no guarantee of its size), but directly the optimal lists of segments deployable by the underlying hardware. ROUTOURNE thus facilitates the deployment of advanced traffic engineering strategies and policies, notably for load balancing from sources. Despite a route fraught with surprising challenges - in particular, the loss of isotonicity induced by SR - ROUTOURNE proves efficient, inducing at worst a linear overhead. Its accuracy and optimality have been proven, and its effectiveness evaluated by generalizing it to several more or less complex path calculation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks with Independent Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) algorithms commonly sample a random subset of clients to address the straggler issue and improve communication efficiency. While recent works have proposed various client sampling methods, they have limitations in joint system and data heterogeneity design, which may not align with practical heterogeneous wireless networks. In this work, we advocate a new independent client sampling strategy to minimize the wall-clock training time of FL, while considering data heterogeneity and system heterogeneity in both communication and computation. We first derive a new convergence bound for non-convex loss functions with independent client sampling and then propose an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme. Furthermore, we propose an efficient independent client sampling algorithm based on the upper bounds on the convergence rounds and the expected per-round training time, to minimize the wall-clock time of FL, while considering both the data and system heterogeneity. Experimental results under practical wireless network settings with real-world prototype demonstrate that the proposed independent sampling scheme substantially outperforms the current best sampling schemes under various training models and datasets.</description>

      <title>HookChain: A new perspective for Bypassing EDR Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current digital security ecosystem, where threats evolve rapidly and with complexity, companies developing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions are in constant search for innovations that not only keep up but also anticipate emerging attack vectors. In this context, this article introduces the HookChain, a look from another perspective at widely known techniques, which when combined, provide an additional layer of sophisticated evasion against traditional EDR systems. Through a precise combination of IAT Hooking techniques, dynamic SSN resolution, and indirect system calls, HookChain redirects the execution flow of Windows subsystems in a way that remains invisible to the vigilant eyes of EDRs that only act on Ntdll.dll, without requiring changes to the source code of the applications and malwares involved. This work not only challenges current conventions in cybersecurity but also sheds light on a promising path for future protection strategies, leveraging the understanding that continuous evolution is key to the effectiveness of digital security. By developing and exploring the HookChain technique, this study significantly contributes to the body of knowledge in endpoint security, stimulating the development of more robust and adaptive solutions that can effectively address the ever-changing dynamics of digital threats. This work aspires to inspire deep reflection and advancement in the research and development of security technologies that are always several steps ahead of adversaries.
  UNDER CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH: This paper is not the final version, as it is currently undergoing final tests against several EDRs. We expect to release the final version by August 2024.</description>

      <title>DID Link: Authentication in TLS with Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.</description>
