      <title>AEGISS -- Atomic orbital and Entropy-based Guided Inference for Space Selection -- A novel semi-automated active space selection workflow for quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems.
  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks.
  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</description>

      <title>Performance of universal machine-learned potentials with explicit long-range interactions in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2 dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage, their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to biomolecular simulations.</description>

      <title>FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FreeBird.jl, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, FreeBird.jl provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, FreeBird.jl offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>Visualizing intense laser field driven electron dynamics in a multielectron molecule: dynamic electron localization, bonding properties and multiple ionization bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents results and discussion of electron dynamics in molecules in which intense ultrafast pulse drives multiphoton ionization, high harmonic generation, and charge resonance due to the Rabbi flopping in the regime of Charge Resonance Enhanced Ionization (CREI) for the ground state molecular nitrogen cation. We show how ionization rates oscillate with oscillations of envelope reflecting modulation of the population of the excited molecular orbital. We observe the increase in ionization due to mechanisms analogous to Charge Resonance Enhanced Ionization (CREI) and also uncover also the time periods of suppressed ionization. Electronic flux calculations illustrate these changes and help reveal multiple ionization bursts which are for the first time reported for a multielectron non-stretched/ non-dissociating molecule. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of ultrafast intense laser pulses on the bonding properties of a nitrogen molecular ion in these conditions through detailed analysis of electron density and electron density differences, time-dependent average local energy, and time-dependent electron localization function. We illustrate the main characteristics of changes of the electron density that leads to laser induced dynamics of bonding and how the standard criteria lead to the transient properties of double, triple, and lone pair bonding characteristics.</description>

      <title>Notes from the Physics Teaching Lab: NMR Experiments at 21 Gauss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a series of laboratory experiments that can be performed with the Quantum Control apparatus sold by TeachSpin, which uses pulsed NMR techniques to observe the precession of protons in a liquid water sample. With a uniform background magnetic field of 21 Gauss, the protons precess at about 90 kHz, yielding numerous relatively simple observations and measurements that are well suited to undergraduate physics teaching labs. Our goal in this paper is to document some of these experiments in detail, thereby making it easier for instructors to choose material that is best suited for their curricula.</description>

      <title>Ion-Specific Effects at the Surface of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the interaction between salts and surfactants on the water surface using heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD-VSFG) spectroscopy. We used sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a prototype surfactant system at 75 micromolar bulk concentration in water. The vibrational response of the OH band of near-surface oriented water molecules and the CH bands of the hydrophobic tails of the surfactant are measured. We observed a dramatic enhancement of the surface density of the negatively charged SDS (DS-) within a narrow range of added salt concentrations. We demonstrated this increase is strongly ion-specific, and induced by the screening of the lateral Coulomb repulsion of the sulfate headgroups by the added cations, followed by strong hydrophobic interactions (hydrophobic collapse) when the DS- surface density reaches a critical value. For a solution of 75 micromolar SDS, the required concentrations of CsCl, KCl, and NaCl for this transition are 2, 5, and 10 mM, respectively.</description>

      <title>Understanding failures in electronic structure methods arising from the geometric phase effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric phase effect arises from the dependence on the nuclear coordinates in the electronic Hamiltonian, leading to sign changes of the electronic wave functions upon traversal of certain paths in nuclear configuration space. The geometric phase effect can have important consequences for the electronic structure problem, but this fact has largely gone unnoticed. We show how the geometric phase effect can significantly impact the accuracy of approximate electronic structure methods. In particular, we prove that for paths that enclose a conical intersection, any component of the wave function (such as an approximation to it) must vanish exactly, unless the associated conical intersections of the component and the wave function coincide. This has implications for methods that employ intermediate normalization, where the contribution along a reference wave function is fixed. We demonstrate numerically that the failure to account for the phase effect leads to asymptotic discontinuities in the wave function parameters. This results in breakdowns in coupled cluster methods or perturbation theories converging to excited states rather than the ground state. The global nature of the geometric phase effect means that these failures can span extended regions of nuclear configuration space, including regions far away from any conical intersection.</description>

      <title>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Quantum Dynamics of He$_2$ over the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ Electronic Subspace by including Non-adiabatic, Relativistic and QED Corrections and Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic, quantum electrodynamics, as well as non-adiabatic corrections and couplings, are computed for the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$ and c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ electronic states of the helium dimer. The underlying Born-Oppenheimer potential energy curves are converged to 1 ppm ($1:10^6$) relative precision using a variational explicitly correlated Gaussian approach. The quantum nuclear motion is computed over the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ (and B $^1\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-C $^1\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$) 9-(12-)dimensional electronic-spin subspace coupled by non-adiabatic and relativistic (magnetic) interactions. The electron's anomalous magnetic moment is also included; its effect is expected to be visible in high-resolution experiments. The computed rovibronic energy intervals are in excellent agreement with available high-resolution spectroscopy data, including the rovibronic b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-state fine structure. Fine-structure splittings are also predicted for the c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ levels, which have not been fully resolved experimentally, yet.</description>

      <title>The role of confined water in the emergence of electrostatic strong coupling as revealed by nanoseparated charged lipid layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between Strong Coupling (SC) attraction and hydration repulsion in nanoconfined water between like-charged phospholipid layers. It challenges the assumption that SC attraction requires multivalent counterions by showing that hydration water can enhance electrostatic interactions. We combine reflectivities with numerical simulations to analyze supported phospholipid layers under different relative humidity and surface charge densities. X-ray fluorescence demonstrates that we can control the valence of the associated counterions. Experimental measurement of the water thickness, combined with precise determination of charged surface positions by numerical simulations, enable us to compare our experiments with a theoretical model. It shows that charge-screening by hydration water induces SC attraction, even at moderate surface charge densities with monovalent counterions. Furthermore, hydration repulsion is stronger for DPPS compared to DPPC. These findings offer insights into the forces that control interactions between phospholipid layers and have important implications for biological and colloidal systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Electric Dipole Approximation: Electric and Magnetic Multipole Contributions Reveal Biaxial Water Structure from SFG Spectra at the Air-Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra has been severely limited by the absence of quantitative theoretical predictions of higher-order multipole contributions. The previously unknown magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are determined by bulk properties but appear in all experimental SFG spectra, obscuring the connection between measured spectra and interfacial structure. We present the simulation-based framework that predicts the full set of multipole spectral contributions. This framework also yields depth-resolved spectra, enabling the precise localization of spectroscopic features. Applied to the air-water interface, our approach achieves quantitative agreement with experimental spectra for different polarization combinations in both the bending and stretching regions. Higher-order multipole contributions are crucial for correctly interpreting SFG spectra: in the bending band, the electric dipole and the magnetic dipole contributions have similar intensities, and the electric quadrupole contribution is significantly larger. In the OH-stretch region, the electric quadrupole contribution is found to be responsible for the mysterious shoulder at 3600 cm$^{-1}$. Crucially, subtracting the quadrupole and magnetic contributions isolates the second-order electric dipole susceptibility, which is a quantitative probe for interfacial orientational anisotropy. This electric-dipole susceptibility reveals a pronounced biaxial ordering of water at the air-water interface. By resolving a fundamental limitation of the interpretation of SFG spectroscopy, our framework allows for the detailed extraction of interfacial water ordering from SFG spectra.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Mechanics to Organic Liquid Properties via a Universal Force Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools for unraveling atomistic insights into the structure and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, the universal and accurate prediction of macroscopic properties from ab initio calculations remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the trade-off between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Here, we present ByteFF-Pol, a graph neural network (GNN)-parameterized polarizable force field, trained exclusively on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data. Leveraging physically-motivated force field forms and training strategies, ByteFF-Pol exhibits exceptional performance in predicting thermodynamic and transport properties for a wide range of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical and machine learning force fields. The zero-shot prediction capability of ByteFF-Pol bridges the gap between microscopic QM calculations and macroscopic liquid properties, enabling the exploration of previously intractable chemical spaces. This advancement holds transformative potential for applications such as electrolyte design and custom-tailored solvent, representing a pivotal step toward data-driven materials discovery.</description>
