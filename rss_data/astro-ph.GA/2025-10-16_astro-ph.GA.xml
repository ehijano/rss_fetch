      <title>Constraining Ultra-Light Dark Matter mass with Dwarf Galaxy Rotation Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While ultra-light bosonic dark matter (ULDM) in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state could naturally account for the central core in some galaxies and resolve the core-cusp problem, the dark matter density distribution in the outer regions of galaxies remains less explored. We propose a trial wavefunction to model the ULDM distribution beyond the BEC core. We derive the corresponding rotation velocity curve, which shows excellent agreement with those of 12 dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The best-fit ULDM particle mass for each dwarf galaxy falls within a strikingly narrow range of $m=(1.8-3.2)\times 10^{-23}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Spatial Variations of Polarized Synchrotron Emission in the QUIJOTE MFI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized synchrotron emission from ultra-relativistic electrons spiraling the Galactic magnetic field has become one of the most relevant emissions in the Interstellar medium these last years due to the improvement in the quality of low-frequency observations. One of the recent experiments designed to explore this emission is the QUIJOTE experiment.
  We aim to study the spatial variations of the synchrotron emission in the QUIJOTE MFI data, by dividing the sky into physically separated regions. For such task, we firstly use a novel component separation method based on artificial neural networks to clean the synchrotron maps. After training the network with simulations, we fit both $EE$ and $BB$ spectra by assuming a power-law model. Then, we give estimations for the index $\alpha_{S}$, the amplitude, and the ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes.
  When analyzing the real data, we found a clear spatial variation of the synchrotron properties along the sky at 11 GHz, obtaining a steeper index in the Galactic plane of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.1 \pm 0.3$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.1 \pm 0.4$ and a flatter one at high Galactic latitudes of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.05 \pm 0.2$ and $\alpha_{S}^{B} = -2.98 \pm 0.27$. We found average values at all sky of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.04 \pm 0.21$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.00 \pm 0.34$. Furthermore, after obtaining an average value of $A_{S}^{EE} = 3.31 \pm 0.08$ $\mu K^{2}$ and $A_{S}^{BB} = 0.93 \pm 0.02$ $\mu K^{2}$, we estimate a ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes of $A_{S}^{BB}/A_{S}^{EE} = 0.28 \pm 0.08$.
  Based on the results we conclude that, although neural networks seem to be valuable methods to apply on real ISM observations, combined analyses with Planck, WMAP and/or CBASS data are mandatory to reduce the contamination from QUIJOTE maps and then improve the accuracy of the estimations.</description>

      <title>ALMAGAL VIII. Cataloging Hierarchical Mass Structure from Cores to Clumps across the Galactic Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the multi-scale fragmentation of dense clumps into compact cores is essential for understanding the processes that govern the initial distribution of mass in stellar clusters and how high-mass stars ($&gt;8~M_{\odot}$) form. We present a catalog of the hierarchical continuum structure from 904 clumps observed in the ALMAGAL program, a high resolution ($0.15-0.8$\arcsec) 1.38 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program targeting dense clumps capable of high-mass star formation throughout the Galactic disk. We use \verb|astrodendro|, a dendrogram-based algorithm, on a uniform linear resolution (2000 au) version of the data to extract 5160 continuum structures with effective radii spanning $800-42000$ au and estimated masses between $~0.05-670~M_{\odot}$. With our large sample, we statistically examine the difference in clump properties for regions with varying levels of hierarchical complexity. We find that clumps exhibiting the richest hierarchical morphology have distributions with higher dust temperatures, surface densities, luminosity-to-mass (\textit{L/M}) ratios, and most massive core (MMC) masses, indicating that these regions tend to be at later evolutionary stages. We find a positive correlation between the mass of cores from the ALMAGAL core catalog and the surface density of their surrounding structures identified in this work. However, this correlation is weaker for cores in more evolved clumps, where lower mass cores can be found at higher local surface densities. This could indicate that some cores accrete mass less efficiently from the intra-clump reservoir than others, despite the total available mass increasing over time, a scenario that is congruent with a clump-fed core accretion model.</description>

      <title>Only the Special Survive: Evolution of Long-Lived Star Clusters in Galaxy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to answer one crucial question behind the discrepancy between chemical trends of field stars and clusters in the Galactic disk: is the chemical gradient mismatch driven by cluster migration and differential survivability as a function of galactic location? To answer this question, we explored the evolution of long-lived (&gt; 1 Gyr) star clusters in Milky Way-galaxy simulations. In particular, we investigated why some star clusters remain bound over billions of years. We have traced the unique trajectories for a sample of open clusters around two FIRE galaxies throughout cosmic time. Additionally, we characterized the small-scale environment surrounding these clusters over their orbital history. We see that clusters across both FIRE galaxies spend the majority of their lives in under-dense regions of gas, except for brief passages where they interact with gas clouds, causing their orbits to be altered.</description>

      <title>Probing the magneto-ionic medium of the Milky Way using pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are fundamental to the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) in spiral galaxies and are often separated into large-scale, regular ($\boldsymbol{B}$) and small-scale, random ($\boldsymbol{b}$) components. The thermal electron density, $n_{\rm e}$, can also be divided into large-scale, diffuse, $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle$, and small-scale, clumpy, $\delta n_{\rm e}$, components. Estimating the properties of $b$ and $\delta n_{\rm e}$ from observations, even within the Milky Way, has long been challenging. This work addresses the challenge using pulsars, which probe the Milky Way's magneto-ionic medium. Using data of more than 1200 pulsars from the Australia Telescope National Facility pulsar catalogue, we combine dispersion (${\rm DM}$) and rotation (${\rm RM}$) measures with theoretical models to estimate both small- and large-scale properties of the Galactic magnetic field and thermal electron density. We find no significant correlation between the average parallel magnetic field strength, $\langle B_{\parallel} \rangle [\mu{\rm G}] = 1.232\,{\rm RM}\,[{\rm rad\,m^{-2}}]/{\rm DM}\,[{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}]$, and pulsar distance. For pulsars within $20\,{\rm kpc}$, we estimate $|B| \approx 1.2\,\mu{\rm G}$ and $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle \approx 0.05\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. More importantly, we determine correlation lengths of small-scale components, $\ell_{b} \approx 20$ -- $30\,{\rm pc}$ and $\ell_{\delta n_{\rm e}} \approx 250$ -- $300\,{\rm pc}$. At smaller distances, $B$ remains roughly constant, while $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle$ increases and both length scales decrease. These results refine our understanding of fundamental scales in the magneto-ionic medium, aiding the interpretation of extragalactic ${\rm RM}$s and providing insights into the role of magnetic fields in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Galactic chemical evolution with the short-lived isotopes Mn-53, Fe-60, Hf-182, and Pu-244</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We run a three-dimensional Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model to follow the propagation of Mn-53 from supernovae of type Ia (SNIa), Fe-60 from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Hf-182 from intermediate mass stars (IMSs), and Pu-244 from neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the Galaxy. We compare the GCE of these short-lived radioactive isotopes (SLRs) to recent detections on the deep-sea floor. We find that although these SLRs originate from different sites, they often arrive conjointly on Earth.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Protoclusters as Drivers of Cosmic Reionization: I. Bubble Overlap at Redshift z ~ 7 in LAGER-z7OD1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.</description>

      <title>The Dependency of Bar Formation Timescale on Disk Mass Fraction, Toomre $Q$, and Scale Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13152v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bars are one of the most prominent galactic structures. The classical swing-amplification theory can qualitatively describe the spontaneous bar instability of stellar disks. Still, it cannot quantify the bar formation process or explain why some disk galaxies do not have a bar. Recent studies found that the bar formation timescale depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction of the host galaxy (dubbed as "Fujii relation"), but they only explored a limited parameter space, where the physical effects of Toomre $Q$ (local disk stability parameter) and disk scale height of the host galaxies are not fully explored. In this work, we check the robustness of the Fujii relation in a higher-dimensional parameter space of disk mass fraction, Toomre $Q$, and scale height. We find that the Fujii relation holds for disk galaxies with physically reasonable Toomre $Q$ and scale height. Furthermore, the bar formation timescale also approximately linearly depends on both Toomre $Q$ and scale height, with a more prolonged bar formation in a hotter or thicker disk. We propose an empirical relation to combine the dependency of the bar formation timescale on the three parameters. Based on the empirical relation and recent observations, we estimate that the bar formation timescale in pure stellar disks ranges from $0.20_{-0.06}^{+0.09}~\mathrm{Gyr}$ to $12.20_{-2.80}^{+3.37}~\mathrm{Gyr}$ or even significantly beyond the Hubble timescale in some extreme cases.</description>

      <title>Dependency of the Bar Formation Timescale On The Halo Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bars are among the most prominent structures in disk galaxies. While the widely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for their formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in isolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the so-called "Fujii relation") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness. However, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body models of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random motions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo, we explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing bar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both prograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short timescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for moderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to accelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo spin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might arise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>Discovery of red galaxy candidates at z ~ 12: Early dust growth or significant nebular emission with high-temperature stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two z ~ 12 galaxy candidates with unusually red UV slopes (betaUV ~&gt; -1.5), and probe the origin of such colors at cosmic dawn. From Prospector fits to the UNCOVER/MegaScience dataset -- deep JWST/NIRCam imaging of Abell 2744 in 20 broad- and medium-bands -- we identify several new z &gt; 10 galaxies. Medium-band data improve redshift estimates, revealing two lensed (mu ~ 3.3) z ~ 12 galaxies in a close pair with beta_UV ~&gt; -1.5 at an UV absolute magnitude of M_UV ~ -19 mag, lying away from typical scatter on previously known MUV-betaUV relations. SED fitting with Prospector, Bagpipes, and EAZY support their high-z nature, with probability of low-z interlopers of p(z &lt; 7) &lt; 10%. The potential low-z interlopers are z ~ 3 quiescent galaxies (QGs), but unexpected to be detected at the given field of view unless z ~ 3 QG stellar mass function has a strong turn up at log Mstar/Msun ~ 9. Unlike typical blue high-redshift candidates (beta_UV ~&lt; -2.0), these red slopes require either dust or nebular continuum reddening. The dust scenario implies Av ~ 0.8 mag, which is larger than theoretical predictions, but is consistent with a dust-to-stellar mass ratio (log M_dust/M_star ~ -3). The nebular scenario demands dense gas (log nH /cm^3 ~ 4.0) around hot stars (log Teff [K] ~ 4.9). Spectroscopic follow-up is essential to determine their true nature and reveal missing galaxies at the cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>The dependence of black hole formation in open clusters on the cluster formation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed N-body simulations of both individual cluster evolution and subcluster coalescence, demonstrating that cluster evolution and its outcomes strongly depend on the cluster formation process through comparisons of different gas expulsion modes and formation channels. The evolution of star clusters is significantly shaped by the gas expulsion mode, with faster expulsion producing greater mass loss. A broader degeneracy exists among initial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel (monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and black hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion enables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within the tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate to slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas expulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity distribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which governs both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding clusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making them prime candidates for black hole searches with {\it Gaia}. Our results highlight the crucial influence of early gas expulsion and cluster formation mechanisms on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and black hole production. These factors should be carefully incorporated into the initial conditions of N-body simulations, which necessarily rely on input from the star formation community.</description>

      <title>Old open clusters NGC 188 and M 67 in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a statistical study of two old open clusters NGC 188 and M 67 using Gaia DR3 data. No tidal tails of the clusters were detected, which most likely had been destroyed when the cluster passed through the Galactic plane. The size estimates of the clusters depend on the range of astrometric parameters and stellar magnitudes of the stars used for star counts. The mass spectra of two clusters differ significantly. NGC 188 shows a deficit of low-mass stars compared to M 67. In the halo region of NGC 188 (compared to the core region of the cluster), there is a relative excess of the low-mass stars (just as in the case of M 67) and a deficit of stars in the mass range from 0.66 to 0.9 solar masses. Comparison with the Hunt &amp; Reffert samples showed that almost all the stars from these samples are contained among the stars we selected for counting. Moreover, the group probability of these stars belonging to clusters, estimated by the uniform background method, is higher than 60%. It is shown that the velocity dispersion of single stars (selected according to the `stellar magnitude -- color index' diagrams) is significantly smaller than the velocity dispersion of unresolved binary stars.</description>

      <title>Condensation sequence of circumstellar cluster seeds (CSCCS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, the condensation sequence of circumstellar dust is predicted based on the thermodynamic stabilities of specific condensates in the macroscopic bulk phase. However, at the (sub-)nanometer scale clusters with non-crystalline structures and significantly different properties are energetically favoured. For this reason, we study the thermodynamic stabilities of metal oxide clusters with generic stoichiometries of M$_2$O$_3$ and M$_3$O$_4$, where M represents a metal atom. With an upper size limit of 50 atoms, we consider clusters with sizes n=1$-$10 for (M$_2$O$_3$)$_n$, and n=1$-$7 for (M$_3$O$_4$)$_n$. The M$_2$O$_3$ clusters comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$), Mg-rich pyroxene (MgSiO$_3$) and a size-limited sample of titanates (CaTiO$_3$), whereas the M$_3$O$_4$ clusters include spinel (MgAl$_2$O$_4$), Mg-rich olivine (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and calcium aluminates (CaAl$_2$O$_4$). We find that, apart from the alumina monomer, the aluminum-bearing clusters (Al$_2$O$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$10, and (MgAl$_2$O$_4$)$_n$, n=1$-$7, are favoured over their silicate counterparts (MgSiO$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$10 and (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$)$_n$, n=1$-$7. Also, we find that calcium aluminate clusters, CaAl$_2$O$_4$, are energetically more favourable than magnesium aluminate clusters, MgAl$_2$O$_4$. Furthermore, for a limited data set of (CaTiO$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$2, clusters we find significantly larger stabilities than for the other considered (M$_2$O$_3$)$_n$ clusters, namely Al$_2$O$_3$ and MgSiO$_3$. Future investigations, in particular on titanates and on Ca-rich silicates, are required to draw a more thorough and complete picture of the condensation sequence at the (sub-)nanoscale.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Morphology &amp; Size of X-ray-selected Active Galactic Nuclei Host Galaxies Revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar shape and size-mass relationship of X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using the high-angular resolution and deep sensitivity in the near-infrared of the COSMOS-Web JWST survey field. We present the rest-frame 1-$\mu m$ size, stellar mass, Sersic index, axis-ratio, Gini-$M_{20}$ parameters of 690 moderate luminosity AGNs between redshift 0-3 and with stellar mass $\log M_s\sim 10.75$. We find that AGN host galaxies have an effective radius of 1-5 kpc, which is between star-forming (SFG) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) of the same stellar mass. AGN hosts have similar size-mass trends as SFG and QGs, being smaller at higher redshift for the same stellar mass. The slope of the size-mass relationship of AGN host galaxies is steeper than that of star-forming galaxies. Their rest-frame 1$\mu m$ stellar morphology indicates a significant spheroidal component. We observed a low merger fraction (6%) in our sample as well as substructures similar to disks, bars, and spiral arms in the residual images, which are in tension with evolutionary pathways that require major mergers. However, it may also be due to the different timescales between mergers and AGN activity.</description>

      <title>Comparing subgrid models for cosmic ray diffusion in a magnetized isolated galaxy simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) play a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution by altering gas dynamics and chemistry across multiple scales. Typical numerical simulations of CR transport assume a constant diffusion coefficient for the entire galaxy, despite both numerical and theoretical studies showing that it can change by orders of magnitude depending on the phase of the interstellar medium. Only a few simulations exist that self-consistently calculate CR transport with diffusion, streaming, and advection by the background gas. In this study we explore three subgrid models for CR diffusion, based on popular theories of CR transport. We post-process an isolated, star-forming MHD galactic disk simulated using the RAMSES code. The resulting diffusion coefficients depend solely on the subgrid turbulent kinetic energy and the MHD state variables of the plasma. We use these models to calculate coefficients for vertical transport. We find that they depend critically on the local magnetic field tilt angle. Across models, our resulting diffusion coefficients range from $10^{26}~\rm cm^2s^{-1}$ to $10^{31}~\rm cm^2s^{-1}$, and yield CR energy densities at the midplane from $1$ to $100 ~\rm eV cm^{-3}$, suggesting varied degrees of backreaction on their environment. Using simple approximations, we show that the gamma ray luminosity of the galaxy depends primarily on the gas surface density and the turbulent confinement of CRs by the galactic corona.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Turning Off the Bright Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photometric surveys require precise point spread function (PSF) characterization, as it varies across filters and is crucial for accurate photometry and low surface brightness (LSB) studies. However, the small PSF size provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making it difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions unusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each exposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4 arcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF exhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed. Additionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the filters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no significant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time (within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212 (which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We developed a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated stars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror reflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining different stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a fixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial measurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction improves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about 10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys like J-PLUS. Our pipeline is published as free software (GNU GPLv3) an can be customized to other surveys such as J-PAS, where its impact will be even greater due to its depth.

      <title>Statistical properties of compressible isothermal turbulence from sub- to supersonic conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the statistical properties of isothermal turbulence in both the subsonic and supersonic regimes. The focus is on the influence of the Mach number ($Ma$) and the Reynolds number ($Re$) on both the space-local and scale-dependent fluctuations of relevant gas variables, the density, velocity, their derivatives, and the kinetic energy. We carry out hydrodynamical simulations with explicit viscosity and therefore controlled $Re$. We confirm previous work that the probability density functions (PDFs) of the gas density are approximately log-normal and depend on $Ma$. In contrast, derivatives of the density and velocity field are sensitive to $Re$, with the probability of extreme events growing with $Re$. The PDFs of the density gradient and velocity divergence (dilatation) exhibit increasingly heavy tails with growing $Ma$, signalling enhanced internal intermittency. At sufficiently high $Ma$, the statistics of dilatation are observed to saturate at a level determined solely by $Re$, suggesting that turbulent dilatation becomes limited by viscous effects. We also examine the scale-by-scale distribution of kinetic energy through a compressible form of the K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin (KHM) equation. In the intermediate range of scales, a marked difference is found between subsonic and supersonic turbulence: while Kolmogorov-like scaling applies in the sub- and transonic regimes, supersonic turbulence aligns more closely with Burgers turbulence predictions. The analysis of individual terms in the KHM equation highlights the role of the pressure-velocity coupling as an additional mechanism for converting kinetic energy from large to small scales. Moreover, the contributions of the KHM terms exhibit non-monotonic behaviour with increasing $Ma$, with dilatational effects becoming more pronounced and acting to oppose the cascade of kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the Crossing of Comet 3I/ATLAS's Ion Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During October - November 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, will pass upstream of the Europa Clipper and Hera spacecraft. Here, we identify two potential opportunities for in-situ observations of 3I's ion tail by immersion, facilitated by the close alignment between the comet's hyperbolic trajectory with the ecliptic plane. During the period 30 October - 6 November 2025, it is predicted that Europa Clipper will potentially be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS, providing the opportunity to detect the signatures of an interstellar comet's ion tail. Characteristic changes to the solar wind are also expected to be observed; a magnetic draping structure associated with the comet may be identifiable. It is further predicted that spacecraft Hera will possibly be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS during the period 25 October - 1 November 2025.</description>

      <title>Mass and spin coevolution of black holes inspiralling through dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In extreme/intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (E/IMRIs) embedded in dark-matter (DM) spikes, the secondary black hole can accrete collisionless particles from the surrounding halo. We study how the companion's spin controls this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane. Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>The Supernova 1987A system and its recent evolution - a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova 1987A was the closest supernova event to be observed in nearly 400 years. The outflowing ejecta from the explosion continues to interact with extended circumstellar material and with the equatorial ring (ER) in the triple ring system, while observations of the system have continued across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. This review mainly focuses on works published over the past ten years on Supernova 1987A and its remnant. These include (a) submillimetre, infrared and X-ray studies of molecules, ions and dust in the ejecta, and (b) infrared, optical and X-ray studies of dust and ionized gas in the ER and in the surrounding circumstellar medium, including their time evolution as the ER is shocked and eroded by the impact of high velocity ejecta. Since 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has become available for high angular resolution infrared observations of Supernova 1987A and has made significant contributions to both (a) and (b) above. Its discovery of redshifted narrow-line emission from multiple ion species located at the centre of the ejecta strongly requires the presence there of either a cooling hot neutron star, or a pulsar wind nebula, to power the emission.</description>

      <title>Origin of the two-armed vertical phase-spiral in the inner Galactic disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaia recently revealed a two-armed spiral pattern in the vertical phase-space distribution of the inner Galactic disk (guiding radius $R_\textrm{g} \sim 6.2$ kpc), indicating that some non-adiabatic perturbation symmetric about the mid-plane is driving the inner disk out of equilibrium. The non-axisymmetric structures in the disk (e.g., the bar or spiral arms) have been suspected to be the major source for such a perturbation. However, both the lifetime and the period of these internal perturbations are typically longer than the period at which stars oscillate vertically, implying that the perturbation is generally adiabatic. This issue is particularly pronounced in the inner Galaxy, where the vertical oscillation period is shorter and therefore adiabatically shielded more than the outer disk. We show that two-armed phase spirals can naturally form in the inner disk if there is a vertical resonance that breaks the adiabaticity; otherwise, their formation requires a perturber with an unrealistically short lifetime. We predict analytically and confirm with simulations that a steadily rotating (non-winding) two-armed phase spiral forms near the resonance when stars are subject to both periodic perturbations (e.g., by spiral arms) and stochastic perturbations (e.g., by giant molecular clouds). Due to the presence of multiple resonances, the vertical phase-space exhibits several local phase spirals that rotate steadily at distinct frequencies, together forming a global phase spiral that evolves over time. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to earlier predictions, the formation of the two-armed phase spiral does not require transient perturbations with lifetimes shorter than the vertical oscillation period.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmic ray transport models using circumgalactic medium properties and observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are a pivotal non-thermal component of galaxy formation and evolution. However, the intricacies of CR physics, particularly how they propagate in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), remain largely unconstrained. In this work, we study CGM properties in FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) simulations of the same Milky Way (MW)-mass halo at $z=0$ with different CR transport models that produce similar diffuse $\sim$ GeV $\gamma$-ray emission, as an attempt to further constrain CR transport models. We study the gas morphology and thermal properties, and generate synthetic observations of rest-frame UV ion absorption columns and X-ray emission. CRs lower galaxy masses and star formation rates (SFRs) while supporting more cool CGM gas, which boosts the HI and OVI column densities in the CGM, bringing simulations more in line with observations, but there can be large differences between CR transport models and resolution levels. X-ray emission within and close to galaxies is consistent with thermal (free-free and metal-line) emission plus X-ray binaries, while more extended ($\sim 100\,$kpc) CGM emission is potentially dominated by inverse Compton (IC) scattering, motivating future work on the spatially resolved X-ray profiles. Although comparisons with observations are sensitive to sample selection and mimicking the details of observations, and our analysis did not result in strong constraints on CR models, the differences between simulations are significant and could be used as a framework for future studies.</description>

      <title>Neutral gas phase distribution from HI morphology: phase separation with scattering spectra and variational autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unraveling the multi-phase structure of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) as traced by neutral hydrogen (HI) is essential to understanding the lifecycle of the Milky Way. However, HI phase separation is a challenging and under-constrained problem. The neutral gas phase distribution is often inferred from the spectral line structure of HI emission. In this work, we develop a data-driven phase separation method that extracts HI phase structure solely from the spatial morphology of HI emission intensity structures. We combine scattering spectra (SS) statistics with a Gaussian-mixture variational autoencoder (VAE) model to: 1. derive an interpretable statistical model of different HI phases from their multi-scale morphological structures; 2. use this model to decompose the 2D channel maps of GALFA-HI emission in diffuse high latitude ($|b|&gt;30$\degree) regions over narrow velocity channels ($\Delta v=3$ km/s) into cold neutral medium (CNM), warm neutral medium (WNM), and noise components. We integrate our CNM map over velocity channels to compare it to an existing map produced by a spectrum-based method, and find that the two maps are highly correlated, while ours recovers more spatially coherent structures at small scales. Our work illustrates and quantifies a clear physical connection between the HI morphology and HI phase structure, and unlocks a new avenue for improving future phase separation techniques by making use of both HI spectral and spatial information to decompose HI in 3D position-position-velocity (PPV) space. These results are consistent with a physical picture where processes that drive HI phase transitions also shape the morphology of HI gas, imprinting a sparse, filamentary CNM that forms out of a diffuse, extended WNM.</description>

      <title>H3+ in irradiated protoplanetary disks: Linking far-ultraviolet radiation and water vapor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in Orion's irradiated disk system d203-506 raises the important question of whether cosmic-ray ionization is enhanced in disks within clustered star-forming regions, or whether alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation and excitation. We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region (PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk -comprising the outer disk surface and the photoevaporative wind - exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state dynamical calculations of reactions H2(v&gt;=0) + HOC+ -&gt; H3+ + CO and H2(v&gt;=0) + H+ -&gt; H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited H2(v&gt;=4), a process not previously included in PDR or disk models. We find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization. The predicted H3+ abundance in the disk PDR peaks at x(H3+)~1E-8, coinciding with regions of enhanced HOC+ and water vapor abundances, and is linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G0). The predicted H3+ column density (~1E13 cm^-2) agrees with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of d203-506. We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited H2 and HOC+, drives the vibrational excitation of H3+ in these regions. We expect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G_0 &gt; 1E3. The H3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Galactic echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaia has revealed a variety of substructures in the phase space of stars in the Solar neighborhood, including the vertical `Snail' in $(z,v_z)$ space. Such substructures are often interpreted as the incompletely phase-mixed response of the disc stars to a single perturbation, such as an impulsive encounter with a satellite galaxy. In this paper we consider the possibility that such structures contain manifestations of phase space echoes. First established in plasma physics in the 1960s, echoes arise when a collisionless system is perturbed twice: the macroscopic responses to both perturbations mix to small scales in phase space, whereupon they couple nonlinearly, producing a third macroscopic `echo' response without the need for a third perturbation. We derive the galactic analogue of the plasma echo theory using angle-action variables and apply it to a one-dimensional model of vertical motion in the Milky Way. We verify the predicted echo behavior using idealized test particle simulations, both with and without the inclusion of diffusion through orbital scattering off molecular clouds. While we conclude that the Gaia Snail itself is unlikely a (pure) echo effect, the basic physics we uncover is sufficiently generic that we expect phase-space echoes to be common in disc galaxies.</description>

      <title>CO desorption from interstellar icy grains induced by IR excitation of superhydrogenated PAHs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) radiation dominates dense, interstellar clouds, yet its effect on icy grains remains largely unexplored. Its potential role in driving the photodesorption of volatile species from such grains has recently been demonstrated, providing a crucial link between the solid state reservoir of molecules and the gas phase. In this work, we investigate IR-induced photodesorption of CO for astrophysically relevant ice systems containing perhydropyrene (PHP). This fully superhydrogenated version of pyrene is used as an analogue for large carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related species, as well as hydrogenated carbonaceous grains. The abundance and range of strong IR absorption bands of these carbonaceous species make them interesting candidates for IR-induced effects. We present IR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric measurements probing the effects of IR radiation on two ice systems: a layered ice with CO on top of PHP, and a CO:PHP mixed ice. These ices were irradiated with IR radiation from the FELIX IR Free Electron Laser (FEL) FEL-2. In accordance with previous studies, we confirm that direct excitation of CO is not an efficient pathway to CO desorption, indicating that another energy dissipation mechanism exists. We demonstrate that vibrational excitation of the PHP CH stretching modes leads to efficient CO photodesorption. The derived photodesorption yields are an order of magnitude higher for the layered than the mixed system and comparable to those previously obtained for CO photodesorption from CO on amorphous solid water upon excitation of H$_2$O vibrational modes. Our results indicate that IR excitation of carbonaceous molecules and grains in dense clouds could potentially play an important role in the desorption of volatile species such as CO from icy grains.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Radial Metallicity Gradient-Age Relation in the Milky Way's Thin and Thick Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic disks typically exhibit a negative radial metallicity gradient, indicating faster enrichment in the inner regions. Recent studies report that this gradient becomes flatter with increasing stellar age in the Milky Way's (MW) thin disk, while the thick disk exhibits a mildly positive gradient across all ages. In this work, we revisit the metallicity gradient-age relation (MGAR) in both the thin and thick disks of the MW. We use spectroscopic data from LAMOST DR8 and stellar ages calibrated with asteroseismology. Our results show a steadily flattening MGAR in the thin disk and confirm a positive gradient $\sim0.013\,\mathrm{dex\,kpc^{-1}}$ in the thick disk. The flattening in the thin disk may be caused by large-scale radial migration induced by transient spiral arms, or by a time-dependent steepening of the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient as suggested by recent FIRE2 simulations. The positive gradient in the thick disk may reflect early enrichment of the outer regions by strong feedback or starburst-driven outflows in a turbulent, gas-rich proto-disk. These findings suggest distinct chemodynamical evolution paths for the MW's thin and thick disks and provide valuable constraints for future models of Galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>GALACTICNUCLEUS: A high angular resolution JHKs imaging survey of the Galactic centre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The center of the Milky Way is a unique environment of great astrophysical interest, but its extreme crowding and extinction make it difficult to study. The GALACTICNUCLEUS survey, a high-angular-resolution near-infrared imaging program, was designed to overcome these challenges. We present the methodology and first results of its second data release, which includes major improvements in reduction, calibration, and analysis, providing deeper photometry, improved astrometry, and high-precision proper motions across the Nuclear Stellar Disk. Observations were obtained with VLT/HAWK-I in two epochs separated by seven years, using speckle holography and a ground-layer adaptive optics system. Proper motions were derived both relative, by aligning epochs within the survey, and absolute, by tying to the Gaia reference frame. The new release achieves photometry about one magnitude deeper and astrometry about ten times more precise than the first release. Proper motions reach an accuracy of about 0.5 mas/yr relative to Gaia. In the Arches field, our clustering analysis recovers the cluster with mean velocities consistent with HST-based results. The second data release of the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey provides the most precise ground-based proper motion catalogs of the Galactic Center to date, enabling studies of the Nuclear Stellar Disk, young star kinematics, and new stellar cluster detections.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quantification of Observability and Equation of State of Twin Stars</title>

Abstract: The possibility of discovering twin stars, two neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii, is usually studied in forward modelings by using a restricted number of NS matter equation of state (EOS) encapsulating a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter (QM). Informing our likelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a meta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the literature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and underlying EOSs of twin stars. Of the accepted EOSs, between 12-18\% yield twin stars, depending on the restrictions we place on the second branch. The possibility of twin stars remains robust even under recent observational constraints. We show that many of these twin star scenarios are observable with currently available levels of accuracy in measuring NS radii. We also present the marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of every EOS parameter for each of four mass-radius correlation topologies. We find that the inferred EOS depends sensitively on not only whether twin stars are present, but also the category of twin stars, indicating that the observation of twin stars would provide a strong constraint on the underlying EOS. In particular, for two coexisting hybrid stars having QM cores at different densities, the PDF for QM speed of sound squared $c_{\rm qm}^2$ has two peaks, one below and another above the conformal limit $c_{\rm qm}^2=1/3$ predicted by perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At this early stage of its passage through our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, the recently discovered interstellar interloper, has displayed various anomalous characteristics, determined from photometric and astrometric observations. As largely a pedagogical exercise, in this paper we present additional analysis into the astrodynamics of 3I/ATLAS, and hypothesize that this object could be technological, and possibly hostile as would be expected from the 'Dark Forest' resolution to the 'Fermi Paradox'. We show that 3I/ATLAS approaches surprisingly close to Venus, Mars and Jupiter, with a probability of $\lesssim 0.005$\%. Furthermore the low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity. The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of $\sim{5.9} \times 10^{-5}$ au day$^{-2}$, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate electromagnetic and Dirac field axial-perturbations of a charged regular black hole arising from quantum gravity effects, commonly referred to as the Frolov black hole, a regular (nonsingular) black hole solution. We derive the master wave equations for massless electromagnetic and Dirac perturbations and solve them using the standard Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method along with Pad\'e approximation. From these solutions, we extract the dominant and overtone quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies along with the associated grey-body factors, highlighting the deviations introduced by quantum gravity corrections compared to the classical case of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Furthermore, we analyze the Unruh-Verlinde temperature of this spacetime, providing quantitative estimates of how quantum gravity effects influence both quasinormal ringing and particle emission in nonsingular black hole models.</description>

Abstract: The operation of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) marks a transformative moment in humanity's capacity to detect and characterize interstellar objects (ISOs). With projections indicating an increase from a few detections per decade to potentially one every few months, humanity stands at the threshold of unprecedented scientific opportunity offering revolutionary insights into the nature of rocky materials, building blocks of life and technological products from other star systems. This white paper proposes the establishment of the United Nations Committee on Interstellar Objects (UNCIO), a specialized body designed to coordinate global scientific research, maximize observational coverage, and ensure optimal scientific return from these extraordinary objects from outside the solar system through systematic investigation in cosmochemistry, astrobiology, planetary sciences, fundamental physics, advanced technologies and materials science. The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in our current international infrastructure: the absence of coordinated detection, classification and intercept capabilities, insufficient protocols for rapid scientific response and international policy decisions to time-sensitive observations, and the need for effective science communication to maintain government and public support for these ambitious investigations and global threats to Earth. Drawing from successful international collaborations in areas such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), UNCIO would operate through a dual structure: an executive board for time-critical scientific decisions and an expanded committee for comprehensive stakeholder representation. This initiative is not merely aspirational but urgently practical.</description>

      <title>MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</description>

      <title>False Alarm Rates in Detecting Gravitational Wave Lensing from Astrophysical Coincidences: Insights with Model-Independent Technique GLANCE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.</description>

      <title>Mass dependence of halo baryon fractions from the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We detect the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich imprint of peculiar motions of galaxy groups and clusters, using the photometric DESI Legacy Survey together with cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We develop a comprehensive forward model based on the AbacusSummit cosmological simulations: mock galaxy group catalogues and synthetic kSZ maps are generated, together with a reconstructed peculiar velocity field that allows for photo-$z$ errors, redshift-space distortions, and survey masks. We investigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB), finding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT frequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB temperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial velocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the total baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We find evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial radius. The gas fraction in massive groups is consistent with the universal baryon fraction, but low-mass groups ($10^{12.5} \lesssim M\,/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim 10^{14}$) are depleted to $0.21 \pm 0.06$ times the universal baryon fraction. We find this low virial baryon fraction to be consistent with an extended gas profile, for which the total baryon content reaches the universal value well beyond the virial radius. This conclusion is consistent with previous analyses using X-ray, kSZ, and weak lensing, and plausibly reflects energetic feedback processes from the galaxies in these haloes.</description>
