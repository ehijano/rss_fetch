      <title>A Unified Model and Optimization for Deep Space Radiation Shielding Based on Proton Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of deep space radiation shielding design, traditional high-Z metals are being progressively replaced by novel low-Z materials such as hydrogenated graphene foam, polyethylene-carbon nanotube composite fibers, and boron-rich hydrogen-containing metal-organic frameworks. This transition stems from the constraints of the "gram-scale weight reduction" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding "lightweight performance" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with "proton density" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10). Under constraints of 2-5 layer structures with total thickness &lt;=1 cm, the model's predicted optimal solutions showed an average design error of only 6.2%-8.2% compared to Geant4 heavy simulation dose results. This study provides the first quantitative physical explanation of the inherent trade-off between low-Z materials' "mass savings" and high-Z materials' "space savings." When rho_p&lt;1 mol cm^-3, materials demonstrate extremely high proton utilization rates (eta_p reaching 60-100 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1), achieving 35%-55% mass savings. Conversely, when rho_p&gt;1 mol cm^-3, although eta_p drops below 30 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1, its exceptionally high full absorption threshold (Eth) enables ultra-thin shielding technology. This work offers a robust, physically interpretable, and scalable design tool for multi-objective optimization of area density, thickness, and dose in deep space missions.</description>

      <title>General Implicit Runge-Kutta Integrators for Multifluid Gas-Dust Aerodynamic Drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of aerodynamic drag is a fundamental step in simulating dust dynamics in hydrodynamical simulations. We propose a novel integration scheme, designed to be compatible with Strang splitting techniques, which allows for the straightforward integration of external forces and hydrodynamic fluxes in general-purpose hydrodynamic simulation codes. Moreover, this solver leverages an analytical solution to the problem of drag acceleration, ensuring linear complexity even in cases with multiple dust grain sizes, as opposed to the cubic scaling of methods that require a matrix inversion step. This new General Implicit Runge-Kutta integrator (GIRK) is evaluated using standard benchmarks for dust dynamics such as DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK. The results demonstrate not only the accuracy of the method but also the expected scalings in terms of accuracy, convergence to equilibrium, and execution time. GIRK can be easily implemented in hydrodynamical simulations alongside hydrodynamical steps and external forces, and is especially useful in simulations with a large number of dust grain sizes.</description>

      <title>Alternative approach to time-delay interferometry with optical frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spaceborne gravitational wave observatories, exemplified by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, are designed to remove laser noise and clock noise from interferometric phase measurements in postprocessing. The planned observatories will utilize electro-optic modulators (EOMs) to encode the onboard clock timing onto the beam phase. Recent research has demonstrated the advantage of introducing an optical frequency comb (OFC) in the metrology system with the modified framework of time-delay interferometry (TDI): the removal of the EOM and the simultaneous suppression of the stochastic jitter of the laser and the clock in the observation band. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach with the OFC-based metrology system. We report that after proper treatment, it is possible to use the measured carrier-carrier heterodyne frequencies to monitor the time derivative of the pseudoranges, which represent the physical light travel time and the clock difference. This approach does not require changing the existing TDI framework, as previous OFC based efforts did. We also present the experimental demonstration of our scheme using two separate systems to model two spacecraft. Using this novel approach, we synchronize the two independent phase measurement systems with an accuracy better than 0.47 ns, while the stochastic jitter in the observation band is suppressed down to the setup sensitivity around the LISA performance levels at 15 pm/sqrt(Hz).</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Rotating Stellar Surfaces from Astrometric Jitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry measures shifts in a star's photocentre and can be used to detect reflex motion due to orbiting exoplanets. Brightness asymmetries (e.g. starspots) rotating in and out of view can also cause apparent motion of the photocenter, termed astrometric jitter, that has previously been considered a source of noise. Here, we explore whether it can be used to map stellar surfaces. We derive a Cramer-Rao bound on the minimum variance for which a stellar surface can theoretically be estimated, quantifying the information content in rotational astrometric jitter. To regularize and break singularities in the Fisher information, we impose a spatial-smoothness Gaussian-Markov random field prior. A key challenge in mapping surfaces arises for stars with unknown rotational axis inclinations, requiring joint estimation of the inclination and the stellar surface. We characterize the coupling between them and quantify the precision gain when inclination is known versus unknown.</description>

      <title>In-Orbit GRB Identification Using LLM-based model for the CXPD CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To validate key technologies for wide field-of-view (FOV) X-ray polarization measurements, the Cosmic X-ray Polarization Detector (CXPD) CubeSat series has been developed as a prototype platform for the Low-Energy Xray Polarization Detector (LPD) onboard the POLAR-2 mission. The wide-FOV design significantly increases the complexity of the background environment, posing notable challenges for real-time gamma-ray burst (GRB) identification. In this work, we propose an in-orbit GRB identification method based on machine learning, using simulated spectral data as input. A training dataset was constructed using a Geant4-based simulator, incorporating in-orbit background and GRB events modeled within the 2-10 keV energy range. To meet the computational constraints of onboard processing, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM), which is fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based on miniCPM-V2.6 and quantized to 4-bit precision. The model achieves perfect classification accuracy on validation data and demonstrates strong regression performance in estimating GRB spectral indices, with an RMSE of 0.118. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of onboard deployment through a simulated satellite data processing pipeline, highlighting the potential of our approach to enable future real-time GRB detection and spectral analysis in orbit.</description>

      <title>Towards direct imaging and orbital parameter estimation of supermassive black hole binaries with spaceborne VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct electromagnetic observation of the orbital motion of a sub-parsec, supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) would provide the first conclusive proof of such systems existing. Widely considered to be the sources of gravitational waves, binaries are expected to form as a natural consequence of galactic mergers and determining the processes that drive their evolution is essential for understanding cosmological evolution. In this work, we evaluate the prospects of using ground and spaceborne Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to observe supermassive black hole binaries and estimate their orbital parameters. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is considered as the primary case study. Achieving unprecedented resolution, BHEX will provide access to a new volume of binary parameter space, potentially enabling the first, confident detection of an SMBHB. A binary toy model using a post-Newtonian orbit propagation is developed and simulated observations by BHEX and a ground array of telescopes are performed. An orbit fitting approach using Bayesian dynamic nested sampling is presented and its efficacy is demonstrated on the simulated observational data for a set of example binary systems. It is found that for BHEX, binary detection requires a total flux density of 0.04 Jy with a minimum separation of ~2 microarcseconds and an observable mass ratio dependent on the total flux. With three annual observations, BHEX could constrain semi-major axis and eccentricity of binaries with orbital periods &lt;10 years to within 13% of the true values. A curved trajectory could confidently be detected in binaries with period &lt;23 years. Proposals for how candidate sources could be identified in time for the BHEX mission are also provided. Finally, we constrain the requirements of a future spaceborne VLBI system, capable of performing a statistically significant survey of supermassive black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>Emulating Radiative Transfer in Astrophysical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative transfer is a fundamental process in astrophysics, essential for both interpreting observations and modeling thermal and dynamical feedback in simulations via ionizing radiation and photon pressure. However, numerically solving the underlying radiative transfer equation is computationally intensive due to the complex interaction of light with matter and the disparity between the speed of light and the typical gas velocities in astrophysical environments, making it particularly expensive to include the effects of on-the-fly radiation in hydrodynamic simulations. This motivates the development of surrogate models that can significantly accelerate radiative transfer calculations while preserving high accuracy. We present a surrogate model based on a Fourier Neural Operator architecture combined with U-Nets. Our model approximates three-dimensional, monochromatic radiative transfer in time-dependent regimes, in absorption-emission approximation, achieving speedups of more than 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining an average relative error below 3%, demonstrating our approach's potential to be integrated into state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this starter guide, we provide a high-level overview of analysis of WFC3/IR data available from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). We intend this guide as a starting point for users examining WFC3/IR data for the first time, or for those refreshing their memory on WFC3/IR data analysis. Therefore, we focus on the analysis of archival data, not preparing new observations. Three appendices include A) a summary of the instrument and an optical schematic, B) examples from the Exposure Time Calculator, and C) a glossary of uncommon acronyms. This report addresses only data from WFC3's IR channel; not the UVIS channel.</description>

      <title>A Simple Ray Acceleration Structure for Non-LTE Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel ray acceleration structure for radiative transfer outside of local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE), leveraging techniques from computer graphics to improve computational efficiency. By applying mipmapping (local recursive spatial averaging) and sparse voxel grids, we exploit spatial coherence and sparsity in astrophysical models to accelerate the formal solution of the radiative transfer equation. We introduce a variance-limited mipmapping (VLM) scheme with tunable error control, and extend it to handle anisotropic emission via two methods: velocity interpolation, and so-called "Core and Voigt". Our approach integrates a hierarchical digital differential analyzer (HDDA) for efficient ray traversal, which, combined with the mipmapping scheme achieves an order of magnitude speedup with less than 0.5 % error in the 99.9th percentile of the level populations. These methods are implemented in the DexRT code and demonstrate significant performance gains in realistic solar atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bolometric Correction and Zero-Point Constants of Visual Magnitudes from High-Resolution Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method of obtaining bolometric corrections ($BC_{\rm V}$) from observed high-resolution, high-$S/N$ spectra is described. The method is applied to spectra of 128 stars collected from the literature with well-determined effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$) with $S_\lambda(V)$ transparency profiles of Bessell and Landolt. Computed $BC_{\rm V}$ are found accurate within several milimagnitudes and the effect of different $S_\lambda(V)$ is found to be no more than 0.015 mag. Measured visual to bolometric ratio ($L_{\rm V}/L$) from the sample spectra and classically determined $BC_{\rm V}$ from bolometric ($M_{\rm Bol}$) and visual ($M_{\rm V}$) absolute magnitudes helped us to determine the zero-point constant ($C_{\rm 2}$) of the $BC_{\rm V}$ scale. Determined $C_{\rm 2}$ for each star for each $S_\lambda(V)$ profile revealed $C_{\rm 2} = 2.3653\pm0.0067$ mag if $S_\lambda(V)$ profile of Bessell is used, and $C_{\rm 2} = 2.3826\pm0.0076$ mag if $S_\lambda(V)$ profile of Landolt is used. Expanding $C_{\rm Bol} = 71.197425 ...$ mag and $c_{\rm Bol} = -18.997351 ...$ mag announced by IAU2015GARB2, and using definition of $C_{\rm 2} = C_{\rm Bol}-C_{\rm V} = c_{\rm Bol}-c_{\rm V}$, where capital $C$ is for the absolute and small $c$ is for the apparent, subscripts indicating bolometric and visual, the zero-point constants: $C_{\rm V} = 68.8321\pm0.0067$ mag and $c_{\rm V} = -21.3627\pm0.0067$ mag, if $L_{\rm V}$ and are in SI units, were determined corresponding to $S_\lambda(V)$ of Bessell. The zero-point constants corresponding to $S_\lambda(V)$ of Landolt are smaller, but the difference is not more than 0.02 mag. Typical and limiting accuracies for predicting a stellar luminosity from an apparent magnitude and a distance are analyzed.</description>

      <title>\texttt{ExTraSS}: a Domain Decomposed 3D NLTE Radiative Transfer spectral synthesis code for nebular phase transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the nebular phase, supernovae are powered by radioactive decay and continuously fade, while their densities have decreased enough such that the expanding nebula becomes (largely) optically thin and the entire structure can be studied. Models for the nebular phase need to take Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) effects into account, while at the same time radiative transfer effects often cannot be ignored. To account for the asymmetric morphologies of SNe, 3D input ejecta models must be used. In this work, we present the \texttt{ExTraSS} (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator) code, which has been upgraded to be fully capable of 3D NLTE radiative transfer calculations in order to generate synthetic spectra for explosive transients in the nebular phase, with a focus on supernovae. We solve the long-standing difficulty of 3D NLTE radiative transfer -- to manage generation and storage of millions of photoexcitation rates over $\sim10^{5}$ of cells -- by developing a new Domain Decomposition algorithm. We describe this new methodology and general code operations in detail, and verify convergence and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Searching for Exoplanets Born Outside the Milky Way: VOYAGERS Survey Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations over the past few decades have found that planets are common around nearby stars in our Galaxy, but little is known about planets that formed outside the Milky Way. We describe the design and early implementation of a survey to test whether planets also exist orbiting the remnant stars of ancient dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way, and if so, how they differ from their Milky Way counterparts. VOYAGERS (Views Of Yore - Ancient Gaia-enceladus Exoplanet Revealing Survey) is a radial velocity (RV) search using precision spectrographs to discover exoplanets orbiting very low metallicity ($-2.8 &lt; [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \leq -0.8$) stars born in the dwarf galaxy Enceladus, which merged with the Milky Way galaxy about 10 Gyr ago. A sample of 22 candidates have been screened from a catalog of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) members using a combination of stellar properties and reconnaissance observations from the TRES spectrograph. Precision RV measurements have been initiated using the NEID, HARPS-N, and CARMENES spectrographs. We plan to focus most upcoming observations on 10 main sequence targets. Data collection is well underway, with 778 observations on 22 candidates (385 of which are 10 focus targets), but far from complete. This survey is designed to be sensitive to sub-Neptune mass planets with periods up to hundreds of days. We note that the RV analysis gives mass multiplied by $\sin (inclination)$ or the minimum mass for exoplanets. The expected survey yield is three planets, assuming that occurrence rates are similar to those in the Milky Way and taking into account the degeneracy with inclination in our yield models. Our survey is designed to detect at least one exoplanet if occurrence rates are similar to known Milky Way exoplanets or, if no exoplanets are discovered, to rule out a Milky Way-like planet population in GES with 95% confidence level.</description>

Abstract: The search for neutrinoless double beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$) is fundamental for investigating lepton-number violation, probing new physics beyond the Standard Model, and determining whether neutrinos are Majorana particles. CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory of Rare Events), a cryogenic bolometric experiment at LNGS, studies 0$\nu\beta\beta$ in $^{130}$Te using 988 TeO$_2$ crystals. It is a milestone of cryogenic detector arrays with a tonne-scale detector operated for more than 7~years below 15~mK. Since 2017, CUORE has accumulated over 2.9~tonne-years of exposure, achieving one of the leading 0$\nu\beta\beta$ limits and one of the most precise two-neutrino double beta decay (2$\nu\beta\beta$) half-life measurements thanks to a detailed background reconstruction across a broad energy range. Building on CUORE's success, CUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle ID) aims to significantly enhance its 0$\nu\beta\beta$ discovery sensitivity to $10^{27}$ yr in $^{100}$Mo, covering the Inverted Hierarchy of neutrino masses. It will employ 1596 lithium molybdate (Li$_2$MoO$_4$) crystals enriched in $^{100}$Mo, alongside 1710 light detectors with Neganov-Trofimov-Luke amplification, enabling simultaneous heat and light readout for enhanced background rejection, particularly against alpha contamination and 2$\nu\beta\beta$ pileup. CUPID will reuse CUORE's cryostat and infrastructure. Current efforts focus on detector performance validation, sensitivity studies, and finalizing the experimental design to maximize physics reach. This work presents the latest CUORE results and outlines the key milestones toward CUPID's realization.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous detection of the size and velocity of the largest ejecta particles with velocities exceeding 1 km^{-1}</title>

Abstract: Impact ejecta with velocities exceeding the escape velocity of planetary bodies become meteorites and dust particles in interplanetary space. We present a new method that allows simultaneous measurement of the size and velocity of the largest high-velocity ejecta. High-speed camera images revealed the time required for the ejecta to reach the secondary target, and ejecta size was determined after the experiment by analyzing the craters formed upon their impact on the secondary target. We defined the size-velocity relationships of sub-millimeter ejecta with velocities exceeding 1 km^{-1}, focusing on the largest detectable ejecta in our experiments. The results show that millimeter-sized meteoroids impacting the rocky surfaces of planetary bodies at 7 km^{-1} eject particles up to a few tens of micrometers in size toward interplanetary space at velocities exceeding the escape velocity of the body, even when it is greater than 1 km^{-1}.</description>

      <title>Probing Supernovae through gravitational wave entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an entropy-based framework to analyze gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae. We use waveforms generated by numerical simulations and analyze them in both the time domain and the time-frequency domain using short-time Fourier and continuous wavelet transforms. From each representation, we compute four entropy measures -- Shannon, exponential, R\'enyi, and Tsallis -- and apply three feature selection methods to identify the most informative features. We then train machine-learning classifiers on these features to compare the performance of different methodological combinations. We find that the combination of R\'enyi entropy from the wavelet domain and the Relief-F selection method yields the most effective discrimination among different gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Spacecraft Angular Rate Estimation via Event-Based Camera Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for determining spacecraft angular rates using event-based camera sensing. This is achieved by analyzing the temporal distribution of brightness events triggered by the apparent motion of stars. The location and polarity of the events are used to infer the apparent motion field of the stars, which is, in turn, employed to estimate the observer angular velocity in the camera frame. This can be converted to the spacecraft angular rates provided an attitude reference. The method is validated through numerical simulation for a synthetic dataset of event streams generated on random spacecraft pointing and rates conditions. The accuracy of the method is assessed, demonstrating its potential to complement or replace conventional rate sensors in spacecraft systems using event camera sensing.</description>

      <title>High Power Arbitrary RF Pulse Shaping Tests with NG-LLRF and Cool Copper Collider Prototype Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RF pulse modulation techniques are widely applied to shape RF pulses for various types of RF stations of particle accelerators. The amplitude and phase modulations are typically implemented with additional RF components that require drive or control electronics. For the RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) based next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) platform, which we have developed in the last several years, RF modulation and demodulation are fully implemented in the digital domain. Therefore, arbitrary RF pulse shaping can be realized without any additional analogue components. We performed a range of high-power experiments with the NG-LLRF and a prototype Cool Copper Collider (C\(^3\)) structure. In this paper, the RF field measured at different stages with different pulse shapes and peak power levels up to 16.45 MW will be demonstrated and analyzed. The high precision pulse shaping schemes of the NG-LLRF can be applied to realize the phase modulation for a linear accelerator injector, the phase reversal for a pulse compressor, or the modulation required to compensate for the beam loading effect.</description>

      <title>Galactification: painting galaxies onto dark matter only simulations using a transformer-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connecting the formation and evolution of galaxies to the large-scale structure is crucial for interpreting cosmological observations. While hydrodynamical simulations accurately model the correlated properties of galaxies, they are computationally prohibitive to run over volumes that match modern surveys. We address this by developing a framework to rapidly generate mock galaxy catalogs conditioned on inexpensive dark-matter-only simulations. We present a multi-modal, transformer-based model that takes 3D dark matter density and velocity fields as input, and outputs a corresponding point cloud of galaxies with their physical properties. We demonstrate that our trained model faithfully reproduces a variety of galaxy summary statistics and correctly captures their variation with changes in the underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters, making it the first accelerated forward model to capture all the relevant galaxy properties, their full spatial distribution, and their conditional dependencies in hydrosimulations.</description>

      <title>K-Contact Distance for Noisy Nonhomogeneous Spatial Point Data with application to Repeating Fast Radio Burst sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to analyze nonhomogeneous Poisson processes (NHPP) observed with noise, focusing on previously unstudied second-order characteristics of the noisy process. Utilizing a hierarchical Bayesian model with noisy data, we estimate hyperparameters governing a physically motivated NHPP intensity. Simulation studies demonstrate the reliability of this methodology in accurately estimating hyperparameters. Leveraging the posterior distribution, we then infer the probability of detecting a certain number of events within a given radius, the $k$-contact distance. We demonstrate our methodology with an application to observations of fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment's FRB Project (CHIME/FRB). This approach allows us to identify repeating FRB sources by bounding or directly simulating the probability of observing $k$ physically independent sources within some radius in the detection domain, or the $\textit{probability of coincidence}$ ($P_{\text{C}}$). The new methodology improves the repeater detection $P_{\text{C}}$ in 91% of cases when applied to the largest sample of previously classified observations, with a median improvement factor (existing metric over $P_{\text{C}}$ from our methodology) of $\sim$ 4800.</description>

      <title>The Exoplanet Edge: Planets Don't Induce Observable TTVs with a Dominant TTV Period Faster than Half their Orbital Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transit timing variations (TTVs) are observed for exoplanets at a range of amplitudes and periods, yielding an ostensibly degenerate forest of possible explanations. We offer some clarity in this forest, showing that systems with a distant perturbing planet preferentially show TTVs with a dominant period equal to either the perturbing planet's period or half the perturbing planet's period. We demonstrate that planet induced TTVs are not expected with dominant TTV periods below this exoplanet edge (lower period limit) and that systems with TTVs that fall below this limit likely contain additional mass in the system. We present an explanation for both of these periods, showing that both aliasing of the conjunction induced synodic period and the near $1:2$ resonance super-period and tidal effects induce TTVs at periods equal to either the perturber's orbit or half-orbit. We provide three examples of known systems for which the recovered TTV period induced by a distant perturbing planet is equal to the perturber's orbital period or half its orbital period. We then investigate \textit{Kepler} two-planet systems with TTVs and identify 13 two-planet systems with TTVs below this TTV period lower limit -- thus potentially uncovering the gravitational influence of new planets and/or moons. We conclude by discussing how the exoplanet edge effects can be used to predict the presence of distance companion planets, in situations where TTVs are detected and where nearby companions can be ruled out by additional observations, such as radial velocity data.</description>

      <title>MaxWave: Rapid Maximum Likelihood Wavelet Reconstruction of Non-Gaussian features in Gravitational Wave Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors have increased the detection rate of transient astrophysical signals. We improve the existing BayesWave initialization algorithm and present a rapid, low latency approximate maximum likelihood solution for reconstructing non-Gaussian features. We include three enhancements: (1) using a modified wavelet basis to eliminate redundant inner product calculations, (2) shifting from traditional time-frequency-quality factor (TFQ) wavelet transforms to time-frequency-time extent (TF$\tau$) transforms to optimize wavelet subtractions, and (3) implementing a downsampled heterodyned wavelet transform to accelerate initial calculations. Our model can be used to denoise long-duration signals, which include the stochastic gravitational wave background from numerous unresolved sources and continuous wave signals from isolated sources such as rotating neutron stars. Through our model, we can also supplement machine learning applications that use spectrographic training data to classify and understand glitches by providing non-whitened, time and frequency domain reconstructions of any glitch.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gravitational Waves from Exoplanets Orbiting Binary Neutron Stars with B-DECIGO and DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) signal in 2015 has opened a new observational window to probe the universe. This probe can not only reveal previously inaccessible binaries, black holes, and other compact objects, but also can detect exoplanets through their imprint on GW signals, thereby significantly extend current exoplanet surveys. To date, nearly 6000 exoplanets have been confirmed, yet most of them reside either in the solar neighbourhood or along the sightline toward the Galactic bulge, reflecting the range limits of traditional electromagnetic techniques. In this work, we follow the method proposed in N.Tamanini&amp;C.Danielski(2019) to investigate frequency modulations in GW signals from early-stage binary neutron stars (BNSs) induced by circumbinary planets (CBPs) and obtain that CBPs can be detected by the future space-borne detector DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO). For BNS system with the masses of two components both being 1.4 $M_{\odot}$, DECIGO could detect CBPs with mass being dozens of times that of Jupiter out to distances of $\sim 1$ Gpc, well beyond the Local Supercluster, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution for the post main-sequence stage.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanical systems have recently been proposed as detectors for ultralight dark matter, leveraging their ability to cool and probe mechanical oscillators at the quantum limit. Here we present a resonant search for ultralight dark matter using a cavity optomechanical accelerometer. The detector consists of a cryogenic Si$_3$N$_4$-membrane cavity mounted to a 4 K copper plate, with photothermal tuning used to scan its 39 kHz mechanical resonance. Shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation-pressure feedback cooling yield an acceleration sensitivity of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over 30 Hz near resonance. The detector's material inhomogeneity gives access to direct vector coupling to the dark-matter field. We conduct a Bayesian search based on matched-filter statistics, yielding upper bounds consistent with thermal noise and above those set by equivalence principle tests. No signal is observed, but the experiment demonstrates stable, quantum-limited operation and validates a scalable approach to resonant detection. With optimized test masses, lower temperature, and multiplexed arrays, the platform offers a path toward competitive constraints on vector-mediated dark-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Structures: A Comparison of Weak Lensing Convergence Maps and Lensing-Weighted Galaxy Density Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the result of a comparison between the dark matter distribution inferred from weak gravitational lensing and the observed galaxy distribution to identify dark structures with a high dark matter-to-galaxy density ratio. To do this, we use weak lensing convergence maps from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, and construct corresponding galaxy convergence maps at $z\lesssim1.0$, representing projected galaxy number density fluctuations weighted by lensing efficiency. The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22 regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey boundaries, we select seven of the most probable candidates for dark structures. This sample provides valuable testbeds for further investigations into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become available, such as the $\textit{Euclid}$ mission, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>
