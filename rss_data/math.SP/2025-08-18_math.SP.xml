      <title>Stability of Inverse Resonance Problem on the Half Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse resonance problem in one-dimensional scattering theory. The scattering matrix consists of $2\times 2$ entries of meromorphic functions, which are quotients of certain Fourier transform. The resonances are expressed as the zeros of Fourier transform of wave field. For compactly-supported perturbation, we are able to quantitatively estimate the zeros and poles of each meromorphic entry. The size of potential support is connected to the zero distribution of scattered wave field. We derive the inverse stability on scattering source based on certain knowledge on the perturbation theory of resonances. When the resonances are distributed regularly, there is certain natural stability through the value distribution theory.</description>

      <title>Plancherel-P\'{o}lya's Type of Instability in Vibration System with Multiple Frozen Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of the inverse spectral problem of Sturm-Liouville operator with multiple frozen arguments at $\{a_{1}, a_{2},\ldots,a_{N}\}$ in $(0,\pi)$. One may consider the characteristic functions as perturbation of sine or of cosine functions depending on the boundary problem prescribed. However, such perturbation is represented in the form of Fourier transform of certain function which may or may not bring in Riesz basis theory and classical perturbation theory in functional analysis. We shall demonstrate the spectral perturbation in Plancherel-P\'{o}lya's type of inequality and connect to perturbation of related potential functions in $L^{2}$-functional norm.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Inverse Spectral Problem of Non-Local Sturm-Liouville Operators on Star Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the inverse spectral problem of Sturm-Liouville operator on a star-like graph. To this fixed star-like graph centered at the origin as its vertex, we attach $m$ edges. On each edge, we impose the Sturm-Liouville operator with certain non-local potential functions with some suitable non-local boundary value conditions. At the vertex, we consider a frozen argument type of condition at zero to model a network that fixed on the end of each edge on the graph. The vibration and flow changes are monitored at that vertex which serves as certain control center. There is an inverse uniqueness subject to the suitable non-local boundary condition. We show that the system is solvable. Additionally, we give a Weyl's type of spectral asymptotics.</description>

      <title>The Schr\"oder-Bernstein property for operators on Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20140v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish that the complete theory of a Hilbert space equipped with a normal operator has the Schr\"oder-Bernstein property. This answers a question of Argoty, Berenstein, and the first-named author. We also prove an analogous statement for unbounded self-adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Weyl Law for Schr\"odinger Operators on Noncompact Manifolds, Heat Kernel, and Karamata-Hardy-Littlewood Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on our earlier work on heat kernel asymptotics for Schr\"odinger-type operators on noncompact manifolds, we establish both the classical and semiclassical Weyl laws for Schr\"odinger operators of the form $\Delta+V$ and $\hbar^2\Delta+V$ on complete noncompact manifolds. While the semiclassical law can be approached via localization, the classical Weyl law has remained widely expected but unproven in this generality. We impose a mild bounded integral oscillation condition on $ V $ in addition to the assumptions that $V$ diverges at infinity and satisfies a doubling condition. In this setting, our oscillation condition is sharp and strictly weaker than all previously known assumptions, even in the Euclidean case.
  A central novelty of our approach is an extended Karamata-Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem, adapted to accommodate non-regularly varying spectral asymptotics in noncompact settings, together with its semiclassical analogue. These Tauberian tools allow us to derive both versions of Weyl's law within a unified framework.</description>
