      <title>On {\Gamma}-embeddings and partial actions of function spaces A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the extension of partial actions of topological groups on topological spaces. Within this framework, we introduce a class of topological embeddings defined via the inverse semigroup of homeomorphisms between open subsets of a topological space. We describe several embeddings of this type, referred to as $\Gamma$- embeddings, and we place particular emphasis on one of them. In particular, we prove that every topological space $Y$ admits a $\Gamma$-embedding into the space of continuous functions $C(X, Y )$, equipped with the compact-open topology, where $X$ is a compact space. Consequently, any partial action $\theta$ of a topological group $G$ on $ Y$ naturally induces a partial action $\hat\theta$ on $C(X, Y ).$ Throughout the paper, we investigate various relationships between these actions, as well as between their corresponding globalizations and enveloping spaces.</description>

      <title>On topologization of the extended bicyclic semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-discrete semigroup $T_1$-topologies on the extended bicyclic semigroup $\mathscr{C}_\mathbb{Z}$ are constructed. Also, we present topological conditions, when a semigroup (shift-continuous) $T_1$-topology on $\mathscr{C}_\mathbb{Z}$ is discrete.</description>

      <title>The Zariski Topology on Homeomorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zariski topology on a group G is the coarsest topology such that all sets of the form $\{x \in G | 1_G \neq g_0 x^{k_0} g_1 ... g_{l-1} x^{k_{l-1}} g_l\}$ are open. Originally introduced by Bryant as the verbal topology, it serves as a fundamental tool for investigating the topological structure of infinite groups and is always a $T_1$ topology with continuous shifts and inversion. Since the Zariski topology is coarser than every Hausdorff group topology on G, it provides a natural starting point for topologizing groups; specifically, for countable or abelian groups, it is known that the Zariski topology coincides with the Markov topology-the intersection of all Hausdorff group topologies on G.
  In this paper, we analyze the Zariski topology on various homeomorphism groups. We demonstrate that for the Thompson groups F and T, the Zariski (and thus Markov) topology coincides with the standard compact-open topology derived from their respective actions on $[0,1]$ and $S^1$. In contrast, we show that the Zariski (and thus Markov) topology on Thompson's group V is irreducible, and therefore neither Hausdorff nor a group topology. As V acts highly transitively on each of its orbits, this result stands in notable opposition to a theorem by Banakh et al, which establishes that the Zariski topology on any permutation group containing all finitely supported elements is a Hausdorff group topology.
  We also extend these investigations to Homeo$([0,1])$, Homeo$(S^1)$, and Homeo$(2^\omega)$. We conclude by providing a classification of the topological manifolds $M$ for which the homeomorphism group Homeo$(M)$ admits a Hausdorff Zariski topology.</description>
