      <title>K-PACT: Kernel Planning for Adaptive Context Switching - A Framework for Clustering, Placement, and Prefetching in Spectrum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient wideband spectrum sensing requires rapid evaluation and re-evaluation of signal presence and type across multiple subchannels. These tasks involve multiple hypothesis testing, where each hypothesis is implemented as a decision tree workflow containing compute-intensive kernels, including FFT, matrix operations, and signal-specific analyses. Given dynamic nature of the spectrum environment, ability to quickly switch between hypotheses is essential for maintaining low-latency, high-throughput operation. This work assumes a coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture consisting of an array of processing elements (PEs), each equipped with a local instruction memory (IMEM) capable of storing and executing kernels used in spectrum sensing applications. We propose a planner tool that efficiently maps hypothesis workflows onto this architecture to enable fast runtime context switching with minimal overhead. The planner performs two key tasks: clustering temporally non-overlapping kernels to share IMEM resources within a PE sub-array, and placing these clusters onto hardware to ensure efficient scheduling and data movement. By preloading kernels that are not simultaneously active into same IMEM, our tool enables low-latency reconfiguration without runtime conflicts. It models the planning process as a multi-objective optimization, balancing trade-offs among context switch overhead, scheduling latency, and dataflow efficiency. We evaluate the proposed tool in simulated spectrum sensing scenario with 48 concurrent subchannels. Results show that our approach reduces off-chip binary fetches by 207.81x, lowers average switching time by 98.24x, and improves per-subband execution time by 132.92x over baseline without preloading. These improvements demonstrate that intelligent planning is critical for adapting to fast-changing spectrum environments in next-generation radio frequency systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing IoT Intrusion Detection Systems through Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The augmentation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices transformed both automation and connectivity but revealed major security vulnerabilities in networks. We address these challenges by designing a robust intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect complex attacks by learning patterns from the NF-ToN-IoT v2 dataset. Intrusion detection has a realistic testbed through the dataset's rich and high-dimensional features. We combine distributed preprocessing to manage the dataset size with Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attacks to mimic actual attack scenarios and XGBoost model adversarial training for improved system robustness. Our system achieves 95.3% accuracy on clean data and 94.5% accuracy on adversarial data to show its effectiveness against complex threats. Adversarial training demonstrates its potential to strengthen IDS against evolving cyber threats and sets the foundation for future studies. Real-time IoT environments represent a future deployment opportunity for these systems, while extensions to detect emerging threats and zero-day vulnerabilities would enhance their utility.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Fault-Tolerant Memristive Neural Networks with In-Situ Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic architectures, which incorporate parallel and in-memory processing, are crucial for accelerating artificial neural network (ANN) computations. This work presents a novel memristor-based multi-layer neural network (memristive MLNN) architecture and an efficient in-situ training algorithm. The proposed design performs matrix-vector multiplications, outer products, and weight updates in constant time $\mathcal{O}(1)$, leveraging the inherent parallelism of memristive crossbars. Each synapse is realized using a single memristor, eliminating the need for transistors, and offering enhanced area and energy efficiency. The architecture is evaluated through LTspice simulations on the IRIS, NASA Asteroid, and Breast Cancer Wisconsin datasets, achieving classification accuracies of 98.22\%, 90.43\%, and 98.59\%, respectively. Robustness is assessed by introducing stuck-at-conducting-state faults in randomly selected memristors. The effects of nonlinearity in memristor conductance and a 10\% device variation are also analyzed. The simulation results establish that the network's performance is not affected significantly by faulty memristors, non-linearity, and device variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristor-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with temporal spike encoding enable ultra-low-energy computation, making them ideal for battery-powered intelligent devices. This paper presents a circuit-level memristive spiking neural network (SNN) architecture trained using a proposed novel supervised in-situ learning algorithm inspired by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The proposed architecture efficiently implements lateral inhibition and the refractory period, eliminating the need for external microcontrollers or ancillary control hardware. All synapses of the winning neurons are updated in parallel, enhancing training efficiency. The modular design ensures scalability with respect to input data dimensions and output class count. The SNN is evaluated in LTspice for pattern recognition (using 5x3 binary images) and classification tasks using the Iris and Breast Cancer Wisconsin (BCW) datasets. During testing, the system achieved perfect pattern recognition and high classification accuracies of 99.11\% (Iris) and 97.9\% (BCW). Additionally, it has demonstrated robustness, maintaining an average recognition rate of 93.4\% under 20\% input noise. The impact of stuck-at-conductance faults and memristor device variations was also analyzed.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Automated Vehicle Longitudinal Platoon Formation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05415v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated vehicle (AV) platooning has the potential to improve the safety, operational, and energy efficiency of surface transportation systems by limiting or eliminating human involvement in the driving tasks. The theoretical validity of the AV platooning strategies has been established and practical applications are being tested under real-world conditions. The emergence of sensors, communication, and control strategies has resulted in rapid and constant evolution of AV platooning strategies. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art knowledge in AV longitudinal platoon formation using a five-component platooning framework, which includes vehicle model, information-receiving process, information flow topology, spacing policy, and controller and discuss the advantages and limitations of the components. Based on the discussion about existing strategies and associated limitations, potential future research directions are presented.</description>

      <title>Wardropian Cycles make traffic assignment both optimal and fair by eliminating price-of-anarchy with Cyclical User Equilibrium for compliant connected autonomous vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) open the possibility for centralised routing with full compliance, making System Optimal traffic assignment attainable. However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations.
  We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.</description>

      <title>AxOSyn: An Open-source Framework for Synthesizing Novel Approximate Arithmetic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge AI deployments are becoming increasingly complex, necessitating energy-efficient solutions for resource-constrained embedded systems. Approximate computing, which allows for controlled inaccuracies in computations, is emerging as a promising approach for improving power and energy efficiency. Among the key techniques in approximate computing are approximate arithmetic operators (AxOs), which enable application-specific optimizations beyond traditional computer arithmetic hardware reduction-based methods, such as quantization and precision scaling. Existing design space exploration (DSE) frameworks for approximate computing limit themselves to selection-based approaches or custom synthesis at fixed abstraction levels, which restricts the flexibility required for finding application-specific optimal solutions. Further, the tools available for the DSE of AxOs are quite limited in terms of exploring different approximation models and extending the analysis to different granularities. To this end, we propose AxOSyn, an open-source framework for the DSE of AxOs that supports both selection and synthesis approaches at various abstraction levels. AxOSyn allows researchers to integrate custom methods for evaluating approximations and facilitates DSE at both the operator-level and application-specific. Our framework provides an effective methodology for achieving energy-efficient, approximate operators.</description>

      <title>Studying Disinformation Narratives on Social Media with LLMs and Semantic Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops a continuous scale measurement of similarity to disinformation narratives that can serve to detect disinformation and capture the nuanced, partial truths that are characteristic of it. To do so, two tools are developed and their methodologies are documented. The tracing tool takes tweets and a target narrative, rates the similarities of each to the target narrative, and graphs it as a timeline. The second narrative synthesis tool clusters tweets above a similarity threshold and generates the dominant narratives within each cluster. These tools are combined into a Tweet Narrative Analysis Dashboard. The tracing tool is validated on the GLUE STS-B benchmark, and then the two tools are used to analyze two case studies for further empirical validation. The first case study uses the target narrative "The 2020 election was stolen" and analyzes a dataset of Donald Trump's tweets during 2020. The second case study uses the target narrative, "Transgender people are harmful to society" and analyzes tens of thousands of tweets from the media outlets The New York Times, The Guardian, The Gateway Pundit, and Fox News. Together, the empirical findings from these case studies demonstrate semantic similarity for nuanced disinformation detection, tracing, and characterization.

      <title>Democracy for DAOs: An Empirical Study of Decentralized Governance and Dynamic (Case Study Internet Computer SNS Ecosystem)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) rely on governance mechanism without centralized leadership. This paper presents an empirical study of user behavior in governance for a variety of DAOs, ranging from DeFi to gaming, using the Internet Computer Protocol DAO framework called SNS (Service Nervous System). To analyse user engagement, we measure participation rates and frequency of proposals submission and voter approval rates. We evaluate decision duration times to determine DAO agility. To investigate dynamic aspects, we also measure metric shifts in time. We evaluate over 3,000 proposals submitted in a time frame of 20 months from 14 SNS DAOs. The selected DAO have been existing between 6 and 20 months and cover a wide spectrum of use cases, treasury sizes, and number of participants. We also compare our results for SNS DAOs with DAOs from other blockchain platforms. While approval rates are generally high for all DAOs studied, SNS DAOs show slightly more alignment. We observe that the SNS governance mechanisms and processes in ICP lead to higher activity, lower costs and faster decisions. Most importantly, in contrast to studies which report a decline in participation over time for other frameworks, SNS DAOs exhibit sustained or increasing engagement levels over time.</description>

      <title>Curved Apertures for Customized Wave Trajectories: Beyond Flat Aperture Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam shaping techniques enable tailored beam trajectories, offering unprecedented connectivity opportunities in wireless communications. Current approaches rely on flat apertures, which limit trajectory flexibility due to inherent geometric constraints. To overcome such restrictions, we propose adopting curved apertures as a more versatile alternative for beam shaping. We introduce a novel formulation for wave trajectory engineering compatible with arbitrarily shaped apertures. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that curved apertures offer improved control over wave propagation, are more resilient to phase control constraints, and achieve higher power density across a wider portion of the desired beam trajectory than flat apertures.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian neural networks for nonholonomic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) are a powerful tool for addressing physical systems, particularly those governed by conservation laws. LNNs can parametrize the Lagrangian of a system to predict trajectories with nearly conserved energy. These techniques have proven effective in unconstrained systems as well as those with holonomic constraints. In this work, we adapt LNN techniques to mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints. We test our approach on some well-known examples with nonholonomic constraints, showing that incorporating these restrictions into the neural network's learning improves not only trajectory estimation accuracy but also ensures adherence to constraints and exhibits better energy behavior compared to the unconstrained counterpart.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Hard Combinatorial Optimization with Probabilistic Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers), when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms, provide a compelling and scalable classical pathway for solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms applied to 3D spin glasses: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT). We benchmark these methods against the performance of a leading quantum annealer on the same problem instances. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, in line with expectations from extreme value theory. We then show that APT, when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves, exhibits a more favorable scaling and ultimately outperforms DT-SQA. We demonstrate these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware, projecting that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips can leverage massive parallelism to accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results establish a new, rigorous classical baseline, clarifying the landscape for assessing a practical quantum advantage and presenting p-computers as a scalable platform for real-world optimization challenges.</description>
