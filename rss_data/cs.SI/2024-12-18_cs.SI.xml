      <title>Clustering Time-Snapshots of Temporal Networks: From Synthetic Data to Real-World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of many dynamical systems that describe relationships or interactions between objects can be effectively modeled by temporal networks, which are typically represented as a sequence of static network snapshots. In this paper, we introduce a novel random walk based approach that can identify clusters of time-snapshots in which network community structures are stable. This allows to detect significant structural shifts over time, such as the splitting, merging, birth, or death of communities. We also provide a low-dimensional representation of entire snapshots, placing those with similar community structure close to each other in the feature space. To validate our approach, we develop an agent-based algorithm that generates synthetic datasets with the desired characteristic properties, enabling thorough testing and benchmarking. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our technique by testing it on various social dynamics models and real-world datasets and comparing its performance to several state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings highlight the strength of our approach to correctly capture and analyze the dynamics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>TrendSim: Simulating Trending Topics in Social Media Under Poisoning Attacks with LLM-based Multi-agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trending topics have become a significant part of modern social media, attracting users to participate in discussions of breaking events. However, they also bring in a new channel for poisoning attacks, resulting in negative impacts on society. Therefore, it is urgent to study this critical problem and develop effective strategies for defense. In this paper, we propose TrendSim, an LLM-based multi-agent system to simulate trending topics in social media under poisoning attacks. Specifically, we create a simulation environment for trending topics that incorporates a time-aware interaction mechanism, centralized message dissemination, and an interactive system. Moreover, we develop LLM-based human-like agents to simulate users in social media, and propose prototype-based attackers to replicate poisoning attacks. Besides, we evaluate TrendSim from multiple aspects to validate its effectiveness. Based on TrendSim, we conduct simulation experiments to study four critical problems about poisoning attacks on trending topics for social benefit.</description>

      <title>A multi-theoretical kernel-based approach to social network-based recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are a critical component of e-commercewebsites. The rapid development of online social networking services provides an opportunity to explore social networks together with information used in traditional recommender systems, such as customer demographics, product characteristics, and transactions. It also provides more applications for recommender systems. To tackle this social network-based recommendation problem, previous studies generally built trust models in light of the social influence theory. This study inspects a spectrumof social network theories to systematicallymodel themultiple facets of a social network and infer user preferences. In order to effectively make use of these heterogonous theories, we take a kernel-based machine learning paradigm, design and select kernels describing individual similarities according to social network theories, and employ a non-linear multiple kernel learning algorithm to combine the kernels into a unified model. This design also enables us to consider multiple theories' interactions in assessing individual behaviors. We evaluate our proposed approach on a real-world movie review data set. The experiments show that our approach provides more accurate recommendations than trust-based methods and the collaborative filtering approach. Further analysis shows that kernels derived from contagion theory and homophily theory contribute a larger portion of the model.</description>

      <title>Parallel Motif-Based Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection is a central task in graph analytics. Given the substantial growth in graph size, scalability in community detection continues to be an unresolved challenge. Recently, alongside established methods like Louvain and Infomap, motif-based community detection has emerged. Techniques like Tectonic are notable for their advanced ability to identify communities by pruning edges based on motif similarity scores and analyzing the resulting connected components.
  In this study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of community detection methods, focusing on both the quality of their output and their scalability. Specifically, we contribute an open-source parallel framework for motif-based community detection based on a shared memory architecture. We conduct a thorough comparative analysis of community detection techniques from various families among state-of-the-art methods, including Tectonic, label propagation, spectral clustering, Louvain, LambdaCC, and Infomap on graphs with up to billions of edges. A key finding of our analysis is that motif-based graph clustering provides a good balance between performance and efficiency. Our work provides several novel insights. Interestingly, we pinpoint biases in prior works in evaluating community detection methods using the top 5K groundtruth communities from SNAP only, as these are frequently near-cliques. Our empirical studies lead to rules of thumb threshold picking strategies that can be critical for real applications. Finally, we show that Tectonic can fail to recover two well-separated clusters. To address this, we suggest a new similarity measure based on counts of triangles and wedges (TW) that prevents the over-segmentation of communities by Tectonic.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Temporal Link Prediction with HierTKG: A Hierarchical Temporal Knowledge Graph Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on social media, especially during crises, challenges public decision-making. To address this, we propose HierTKG, a framework combining Temporal Graph Networks (TGN) and hierarchical pooling (DiffPool) to model rumor dynamics across temporal and structural scales. HierTKG captures key propagation phases, enabling improved temporal link prediction and actionable insights for misinformation control. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving an MRR of 0.9845 on ICEWS14 and 0.9312 on WikiData, with competitive performance on noisy datasets like PHEME (MRR: 0.8802). By modeling structured event sequences and dynamic social interactions, HierTKG adapts to diverse propagation patterns, offering a scalable and robust solution for real-time analysis and prediction of rumor spread, aiding proactive intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>SIDE: Socially Informed Drought Estimation Toward Understanding Societal Impact Dynamics of Environmental Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drought has become a critical global threat with significant societal impact. Existing drought monitoring solutions primarily focus on assessing drought severity using quantitative measurements, overlooking the diverse societal impact of drought from human-centric perspectives. Motivated by the collective intelligence on social media and the computational power of AI, this paper studies a novel problem of socially informed AI-driven drought estimation that aims to leverage social and news media information to jointly estimate drought severity and its societal impact. Two technical challenges exist: 1) How to model the implicit temporal dynamics of drought societal impact. 2) How to capture the social-physical interdependence between the physical drought condition and its societal impact. To address these challenges, we develop SIDE, a socially informed AI-driven drought estimation framework that explicitly quantifies the societal impact of drought and effectively models the social-physical interdependency for joint severity-impact estimation. Experiments on real-world datasets from California and Texas demonstrate SIDE's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines in accurately estimating drought severity and its societal impact. SIDE offers valuable insights for developing human-centric drought mitigation strategies to foster sustainable and resilient communities.</description>

      <title>Two Layer Walk: A Community-Aware Graph Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12933v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community structures are critical for understanding the mesoscopic organization of networks, bridging local and global patterns. While methods such as DeepWalk and node2vec capture local positional information through random walks, they fail to preserve community structures. Other approaches like modularized nonnegative matrix factorization and evolutionary algorithms address this gap but are computationally expensive and unsuitable for large-scale networks. To overcome these limitations, we propose Two Layer Walk (TLWalk), a novel graph embedding algorithm that incorporates hierarchical community structures. TLWalk balances intra- and inter-community relationships through a community-aware random walk mechanism without requiring additional parameters. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TLWalk effectively mitigates locality bias. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that TLWalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 3.2% accuracy gains for link prediction tasks. By encoding dense local and sparse global structures, TLWalk proves robust and scalable across diverse networks, offering an efficient solution for network analysis.</description>

      <title>Re-calibrating methodologies in social media research: Challenge the visual, work with Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article methodologically reflects on how social media scholars can effectively engage with speech-based data in their analyses. While contemporary media studies have embraced textual, visual, and relational data, the aural dimension remained comparatively under-explored. Building on the notion of secondary orality and rejection towards purely visual culture, the paper argues that considering voice and speech at scale enriches our understanding of multimodal digital content. The paper presents the TikTok Subtitles Toolkit that offers accessible speech processing readily compatible with existing workflows. In doing so, it opens new avenues for large-scale inquiries that blend quantitative insights with qualitative precision. Two illustrative cases highlight both opportunities and limitations of speech research: while genres like #storytime on TikTok benefit from the exploration of spoken narratives, nonverbal or music-driven content may not yield significant insights using speech data. The article encourages researchers to integrate aural exploration thoughtfully to complement existing methods, rather than replacing them. I conclude that the expansion of our methodological repertoire enables richer interpretations of platformised content, and our capacity to unpack digital cultures as they become increasingly multimodal.</description>

      <title>Scam Detection for Ethereum Smart Contracts: Leveraging Graph Representation Learning for Secure Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of scams within Ethereum smart contracts is a critical challenge due to their increasing exploitation for fraudulent activities, leading to significant financial and reputational damages. Existing detection methods often rely on contract code analysis or manually extracted features, which suffer from scalability and adaptability limitations. In this study, we introduce an innovative method that leverages graph representation learning to examine transaction patterns and identify fraudulent contracts. By transforming Ethereum transaction data into graph structures and employing advanced machine learning models, we achieve robust classification performance. Our method addresses label imbalance through SMOTE-ENN techniques and evaluates models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Experimental results indicate that the MLP model surpasses the GCN in this context, with real-world evaluations aligning closely with domain-specific analyses. This study provides a scalable and effective solution for enhancing trust and security in the Ethereum ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Resilient Adversarial Decision Fusion in Byzantine Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning-based framework for resilient decision fusion in adversarial multi-sensor networks, providing a unified mathematical setup that encompasses diverse scenarios, including varying Byzantine node proportions, synchronized and unsynchronized attacks, unbalanced priors, adaptive strategies, and Markovian states. Unlike traditional methods, which depend on explicit parameter tuning and are limited by scenario-specific assumptions, the proposed approach employs a deep neural network trained on a globally constructed dataset to generalize across all cases without requiring adaptation. Extensive simulations validate the method's robustness, achieving superior accuracy, minimal error probability, and scalability compared to state-of-the-art techniques, while ensuring computational efficiency for real-time applications. This unified framework demonstrates the potential of deep learning to revolutionize decision fusion by addressing the challenges posed by Byzantine nodes in dynamic adversarial environments.</description>

      <title>ClarityEthic: Explainable Moral Judgment Utilizing Contrastive Ethical Insights from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise and widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring their safety is crucial to prevent harm to humans and promote ethical behaviors. However, directly assessing value valence (i.e., support or oppose) by leveraging large-scale data training is untrustworthy and inexplainable. We assume that emulating humans to rely on social norms to make moral decisions can help LLMs understand and predict moral judgment. However, capturing human values remains a challenge, as multiple related norms might conflict in specific contexts. Consider norms that are upheld by the majority and promote the well-being of society are more likely to be accepted and widely adopted (e.g., "don't cheat,"). Therefore, it is essential for LLM to identify the appropriate norms for a given scenario before making moral decisions. To this end, we introduce a novel moral judgment approach called \textit{ClarityEthic} that leverages LLMs' reasoning ability and contrastive learning to uncover relevant social norms for human actions from different perspectives and select the most reliable one to enhance judgment accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in moral judgment tasks. Moreover, human evaluations confirm that the generated social norms provide plausible explanations that support the judgments. This suggests that modeling human moral judgment with the emulating humans moral strategy is promising for improving the ethical behaviors of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Diffusion backbone of temporal higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal higher-order networks, where each hyperlink involving a group of nodes are activated or deactivated over time, are recently used to represent complex systems such as social contacts, interactions or collaborations that occur at specific times. Such networks are substrates for social contagion processes like the diffusion of information and opinions. In this work, we consider eight temporal higher-order networks derived from human face-to-face interactions in various contexts and the Susceptible-Infected threshold process on each of these networks: whenever a hyperlink is active and the number of infected nodes in the hyperlink exceeds a threshold $\Theta$, each susceptible node in the hyperlink is infected independently with probability $\beta$. The objective is to understand (1) the contribution of each hyperlink to the diffusion process, namely, the average number of nodes that are infected directly via the activation of the hyperlink when the diffusion starts from an arbitrary seed node, and (2) hyperlinks with what network properties tend to contribute more. We first propose to construct the diffusion backbone. The backbone is a weighted higher-order network, where the weight of each hyperlink denotes the contribution of the hyperlink to a given diffusion process. Secondly, we find that the backbone, or the contribution of hyperlinks, is dependent on the parameters $\beta$ and $\Theta$ of the diffusion process, which is also supported by our theoretical analysis of the backbone when $\beta\rightarrow 0$. Thirdly, we systematically design centrality metrics for hyperlinks in a temporal higher-order network, and each centrality metric is used to estimate the ranking of hyperlinks by the weight in the backbone. Finally, we find and explain why different centrality metrics can better estimate the contributions of hyperlinks for different parameters of the diffusion process.</description>

      <title>Cluster-guided Contrastive Class-imbalanced Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-imbalanced graph classification, which aims at effectively classifying the categories of graphs in scenarios with imbalanced class distribution. Despite the tremendous success of graph neural networks (GNNs), their modeling ability for imbalanced graph-structured data is inadequate, which typically leads to predictions biased towards the majority classes. Besides, existing class-imbalanced learning methods in visions may overlook the rich graph semantic substructures of the majority classes and excessively emphasize learning from the minority classes. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful approach called C$^3$GNN that incorporates the idea of clustering into contrastive learning to enhance class-imbalanced graph classification. Technically, C$^3$GNN clusters graphs from each majority class into multiple subclasses, ensuring they have similar sizes to the minority class, thus alleviating class imbalance. Additionally, it utilizes the Mixup technique to synthesize new samples and enrich the semantic information of each subclass, and leverages supervised contrastive learning to hierarchically learn effective graph representations. In this way, we can not only sufficiently explore the semantic substructures within the majority class but also effectively alleviate excessive focus on the minority class. Extensive experiments on real-world graph benchmark datasets verify the superior performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Uchaguzi-2022: A Dataset of Citizen Reports on the 2022 Kenyan Election</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online reporting platforms have enabled citizens around the world to collectively share their opinions and report in real time on events impacting their local communities. Systematically organizing (e.g., categorizing by attributes) and geotagging large amounts of crowdsourced information is crucial to ensuring that accurate and meaningful insights can be drawn from this data and used by policy makers to bring about positive change. These tasks, however, typically require extensive manual annotation efforts. In this paper we present Uchaguzi-2022, a dataset of 14k categorized and geotagged citizen reports related to the 2022 Kenyan General Election containing mentions of election-related issues such as official misconduct, vote count irregularities, and acts of violence. We use this dataset to investigate whether language models can assist in scalably categorizing and geotagging reports, thus highlighting its potential application in the AI for Social Good space.</description>

Abstract: Structural Hole (SH) theory states that the node which acts as a connecting link among otherwise disconnected communities gets positional advantages in the network. These nodes are called Structural Hole Spanners (SHS). Numerous solutions are proposed to discover SHSs; however, most of the solutions are only applicable to static networks. Since real-world networks are dynamic networks; consequently, in this study, we aim to discover SHSs in dynamic networks. Discovering SHSs is an NP-hard problem, due to which, instead of discovering exact k SHSs, we adopt a greedy approach to discover Top-k SHSs. We first propose an efficient Tracking-SHS algorithm for updating SHSs in dynamic networks. Our algorithm reuses the information obtained during the initial runs of the static algorithm and avoids the recomputations for the nodes unaffected by the updates. Besides, motivated from the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on various graph mining problems, we also design a Graph Neural Network-based model, GNN-SHS, to discover SHSs in dynamic networks, aiming to reduce the computational cost while achieving high accuracy. We provide a theoretical analysis of the Tracking-SHS algorithm, and our theoretical results prove that for a particular type of graphs, such as Preferential Attachment graphs [1], Tracking-SHS algorithm achieves 1.6 times of speedup compared with the static algorithm. We perform extensive experiments, and our results demonstrate that the Tracking-SHS algorithm attains a minimum of 3.24 times speedup over the static algorithm. Also, the proposed second model GNN-SHS is on an average 671.6 times faster than the Tracking-SHS algorithm.</description>

      <title>Empathy Detection from Text, Audiovisual, Audio or Physiological Signals: A Systematic Review of Task Formulations and Machine Learning Methods</title>

Abstract: Empathy indicates an individual's ability to understand others. Over the past few years, empathy has drawn attention from various disciplines, including but not limited to Affective Computing, Cognitive Science, and Psychology. Detecting empathy has potential applications in society, healthcare and education. Despite being a broad and overlapping topic, the avenue of empathy detection leveraging Machine Learning remains underexplored from a systematic literature review perspective. We collected 829 papers from 10 well-known databases, systematically screened them and analysed the final 62 papers. Our analyses reveal several prominent task formulations $-$ including empathy on localised utterances or overall expressions, unidirectional or parallel empathy, and emotional contagion $-$ in monadic, dyadic and group interactions. Empathy detection methods are summarised based on four input modalities $-$ text, audiovisual, audio and physiological signals $-$ thereby presenting modality-specific network architecture design protocols. We discuss challenges, research gaps and potential applications in the Affective Computing-based empathy domain, which can facilitate new avenues of exploration. We further enlist the public availability of datasets and codes. This paper, therefore, provides a structured overview of recent advancements and remaining challenges towards developing a robust empathy detection system that could meaningfully contribute to enhancing human well-being.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Improve the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for topology perturbations, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attacks. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph. The source code can be found in https://github.com/zhongjian-zhang/LLM4RGNN.</description>
