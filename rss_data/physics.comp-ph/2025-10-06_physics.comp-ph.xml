      <title>Fully automated inverse co-optimization of templates and block copolymer blending recipes for DSA lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) offers a highly promising approach for the fabrication of contact holes or vertical interconnect access at sub-7nm technology nodes. To fabricate circular holes with precisely controlled size and positions, the self-assembly of block copolymers requires guidance from a properly designed template. Effectively parameterizing the template shape to enable efficient optimization remains a critical yet challenging problem. Moreover, the optimized template must possess excellent manufacturability for practical applications. In this work, we propose a Gaussian descriptor for characterizing the template shape with only two parameters. We further propose to use AB/AB binary blends instead of pure diblock copolymer to improve the adaptability of the block copolymer system to the template shape. The Bayesian optimization (BO) is applied to co-optimize the binary blend and the template shape. Our results demonstrate that BO based on the Gaussian descriptor can efficiently yield the optimal templates for diverse multi-hole patterns, all leading to highly matched self-assembled morphologies. Moreover, by imposing constraints on the variation of curvature of the template during optimization, superior manufacturability is ensured for each optimized template. It is noteworthy that each key parameter of the blend exhibits a relatively wide tunable window under the requirement of rather high precision. Our work provides valuable insights for advancing DSA technology, and thus potentially propels its practical applications forward.</description>

      <title>A review on the Parameter Space Concept and its use for crystal structure determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the emerging crystal structure determination method Parameter Space Concept (PSC), which solves and refines either partial or complete crystal structures by mapping each experimental or theoretical observation as a geometric interpretation, bypassing the conventional Fourier inversion. The PSC utilizes only a few \xray (equivalently neutron) diffraction amplitudes or intensities and turns them into piecewise analytic hyper-surfaces, called isosurfaces, embedded in a higher-dimensional orthonormal Cartesian space (Parameter Space (PS)). It reformulates the crystal determination task into a geometric interpretation, searching for a common intersection point of different isosurfaces. The art of defining various kinds of isosurfaces, based on signs, amplitude or intensity values, normalized ratios, and ranking of reflections, offers multiple choices of adapting methods in PSC based on available experimental or theoretical observations. The elegance of PSC stems from one-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates, enabling the construction of full three-dimensional crystal structures by combining multiple projections. By these means, the user may explore homometric and non-homometric solutions within both centric and acentric structures with spatial resolution remarkably down to pm, even with a limited number of diffraction reflections. Having demonstrated the potential of PSC for various synthetic structures and exemplarily verified direct application to realistic crystals, the origin and development of PSC methods are coherently discussed in this review. Notably, this review emphasizes the theoretical foundations, computational strategies, and potential extensions of PSC, outlining the roadmap for future applications of PSC in the broader context of structure determination from experimental diffraction observations.</description>

      <title>Fast surrogate modelling of EIT in atomic quantum systems using LSTM neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of optical quantum systems are essential for the development of quantum technologies. However, these simulations are often computationally intensive, especially when repeated evaluations are required for data fitting, parameter estimation, or real-time feedback. To address this challenge, we develop a Long Short-Term Memory neural network capable of replicating the output of these simulations with high accuracy and significantly reduced computational cost. Once trained, the surrogate model produces spectra in milliseconds, providing a speed-up of 5000x relative to traditional numerical solvers. We focus on applying this technique to Doppler-broadened Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in a ladder-type scheme for Rydberg-based sensing, achieving near-unity agreement with the physics solver for resonant and off-resonant regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the LSTM model on this representative optical quantum system, establishing it as a surrogate tool capable of supporting real-time signal processing and feedback-based optimisation.</description>

      <title>Improper-proper ferroelectric competition as a mechanism for multistate polarisation and ferrielectric-like behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we re-explore a simple textbook Landau model describing improper ferroelectricity and show that in the limit where both proper and improper instabilities exist and compete, improper ferroelectrics can display switching between multiple polarisation states. Using first principles calculations we highlight how the hexagonal tungsten bronze materials may be an archetypal case, with the possibility to switch between improper and proper phases. The resulting functional characteristics are akin to "ferrielectrics", with switching behaviour in the form of a triple hysteresis loop. Such functionality could be ideal for creating non-volatile multistate systems for use in memory devices or as a backbone for neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum advantages for practical non-Hermitian eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has emerged as a rich field of study, with applications ranging from $PT$-symmetry breaking and skin effects to non-Hermitian topological phase transitions. Yet most studies remain restricted to small-scale or classically tractable systems. While quantum computing has shown strong performance in Hermitian eigenproblems, its extension to the non-Hermitian regime remains largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum algorithm to address general non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems, specifically targeting eigenvalues near a given line in the complex plane -- thereby generalizing previous results on ground state energy and spectral gap estimation for Hermitian matrices. Our method combines a fuzzy quantum eigenvalue detector with a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently isolate relevant eigenvalues. This yields a provable exponential quantum speedup for non-Hermitian eigenproblems. Furthermore, we discuss the broad applications in detecting spontaneous $PT$-symmetry breaking, estimating Liouvillian gaps, and analyzing classical Markov processes. These results highlight the potential of quantum algorithms in tackling challenging problems across quantum physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of DGTD for linear Maxwell equations with inhomogeneous interface conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider linear and isotropic Maxwell equations with inhomogeneous interface conditions. We discretize the problem with the discontinuous Galerkin method in space and with the leapfrog scheme in time. An analytical setting is provided in which we show wellposedness of the problem, derive stability estimates, and exploit this in the error analysis to prove rigorous error bounds for both the spatial and full discretization. The theoretical findings are confirmed with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Time-Lagged Recurrence: a data-driven method to estimate the predictability of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in nature and they are hard to forecast. Not only they may be sensitive to small perturbations in their initial conditions, but they are often composed of processes acting at multiple scales. Classical approaches based on the Lyapunov spectrum rely on the knowledge of the dynamic forward operator, or of a data-derived approximation of it. This operator is typically unknown, or the data are too noisy to derive its faithful representation. Here we propose a new data-driven approach to analyze the local predictability of dynamical systems. This method, based on the concept of recurrence, is closely linked to the well-established framework of local dynamical indices. When applied to both idealized systems and real-world datasets arising from large-scale atmospheric fields, our new approach proves its effectiveness in estimating local predictability. Additionally, we discuss its relationship with other local dynamical indices, and how it reveals the scale-dependent nature of predictability. Furthermore, we explore its link to information theory, its extension that includes a weighting strategy, and its real-time application. We believe these aspects collectively demonstrate its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool for complex systems.</description>
