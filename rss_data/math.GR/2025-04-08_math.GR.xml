      <title>Holomorphic Discrete Series of SU(1,1): Orthogonality Relations, Character Formulas, and Multiplicities in Tensor Product Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SU$(1,1)$ group plays a fundamental role in various areas of physics, including quantum mechanics, quantum optics, and representation theory. In this work we revisit the holomorphic discrete series representations of SU$(1,1)$, with a focus on orthogonality relations for matrix elements, character formulas of unitary irreducible representations (UIRs), and the decomposition of tensor products of these UIRs. Special attention is given to the structure of these decompositions and the associated multiplicities, which are essential for understanding composite systems and interactions within SU$(1,1)$ symmetry frameworks. These findings offer deeper insights into the mathematical foundations of SU$(1,1)$ representations and their significance in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Coxeter systems, left inversion sets, and higher dimensional cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ (W,S)$ be a Coxeter system. We investigate the equation $ w(\Phi_{x}) = \Phi_{y}$ where $ w,x,y\in W$ and $ \Phi_{x}$, $\Phi_{y}$ denote the left inversion sets of $ x$ and $ y$. We then define a commutative square diagram called a Coxeter square which describes the relationship between 4 non-identity elements of the Coxeter group $ W$ and the equation $ w(\Phi_{x}) = \Phi_{y}$. Coxeter squares were first introduced by Dyer, Wang in \cite{dyer2011groupoids2} and \cite{dyer2019characterization}. Coxeter squares can be \textquotedblleft glued" together by compatible edges to form commutative diagrams in the shape of higher dimensional cubes called Coxeter $n$-cubes, which were first defined by Dyer in Example 12.5 of \cite{dyer2011groupoids2}. When $ |W| &lt; \infty$ and $ |S| = n$, we show that Coxeter $n$-cubes must exist within $ (W,S)$. We then prove results about Coxeter $n$-cubes in the $A_{n}$ Coxeter system. We establish an explicit bijection between Coxeter $n$-cubes (modulo orientation) in $ A_{n}$ and binary trees with $n+1$ leaves. We also show that an element $x$ of $ A_{n}$ appears as the edge of some Coxeter $n$-cube if and only if $ x$ is a bigrassmannian permutation.</description>

      <title>Completely Inert Subgroups of Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study in-depth the so-called completely inert and uniformly completely inert subgroups of Abelian groups. We curiously show that a subgroup is completely inert exactly when it is characteristically inert. Moreover, we prove that a subgroup is uniformly completely inert precisely when it is uniformly characteristically inert. These two statements somewhat strengthen recent results due to Goldsmith-Salce established for totally inert subgroups in J. Commut. Algebra (2025). Some other closely relevant things are obtained as well.</description>

      <title>Representation Independent Decompositions of Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing complex computation from simpler building blocks is a defining problem of computer science. In algebraic automata theory, we represent computing devices as semigroups. Accordingly, we use mathematical tools like products and homomorphisms to understand computation through hierarchical decompositions. To address the shortcomings of some of the existing decomposition methods, we generalize semigroup representations to semigroupoids by introducing types. On the abstraction level of category theory, we describe a flexible, iterative and representation independent algorithm. Moving from the specific state transition model to the abstract composition of arrows unifies seemingly different decomposition methods and clarifies the three algorithmic stages: collapse, copy and compress. We collapse some dynamics through a morphism to the top level; copy the forgotten details into the bottom level; and finally we apply compression there. The hierarchical connections are solely for locating the repeating patterns in the compression. These theoretical findings pave the way for more precise computer algebra tools and allow for understanding computation with other algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>On primitive prime divisors of the orders of Suzuki-Ree groups (corrected version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a well-known factorization of the number $2^{2m}+1$, with $m$ odd, related to the orders of tori of simple Suzuki groups: $2^{2m}+1$ is a product of $a=2^m+2^{(m+1)/2}+1$ and $b=2^m-2^{(m+1)/2}+1$. By the Bang-Zsigmondy theorem, there is a primitive prime divisor of $2^{4m}-1$, that is, a prime $r$ that divides $2^{4m}-1$ and does not divide $2^i-1$ for any $i&lt;4m$. It is easy to see that $r$ divides $2^{2m}+1$, and so it divides one of the numbers $a$ and $b$. The main objective of this paper is to show that for every $m&gt;5$, each of $a$ and $b$ is divisible by some primitive prime divisor of $2^{4m}-1$. Also we prove similar results for primitive prime divisors related to the simple Ree groups. As an application, we find the independence and 2-independence numbers of the prime graphs of almost simple Suzuki-Ree groups.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Dekimpe, De Rock and Penninckx concerning the existence of eigenvalues one in certain elements of finite groups acting irreducibly on a real vector space of odd dimension.

      <title>Normality conditions in the Sylow $\boldsymbol{p}$-subgroup of $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{Sym}(p^n)}$ and its associated Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we give a description of the structure of the normal subgroups of a Sylow $p$-subgroup $W_n$ of $\mathrm{Sym}(p^n)$, showing that they contain a term from the lower central series with bounded index. To this end, we explicitly determine the terms of the upper and the lower central series of $W_n$. We provide a similar description of these series in the Lie algebra associated to $W_n$, giving a new proof of the equality of their terms in both the group and the algebra contexts. Finally, we calculate the growth of the normalizer chain starting from an elementary abelian regular subgroup of $W_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a formula for computing the size of lower Bruhat intervals for elements in the dominant cone of an affine Weyl group of type $A$. This enumeration problem is reduced to counting lattice points in certain polyhedra. Our main tool is a decomposition -- or tiling -- of each interval into smaller, combinatorially tractable pieces, which we call paper boats. We also conjecture a generalization of this formula to all affine Weyl groups, restricted to elements in the lowest two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cell, which contains almost all of the elements.</description>

      <title>Fast Convolutions on $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ via Radial Translational Dependence and Classical FFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ denote the right coset space of the subgroup consisting of translational isometries of the orthogonal lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ in the non-Abelian group of planar motions $SE(2)$. This paper develops a fast and accurate numerical scheme for approximation of functions on $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$. We address finite Fourier series of functions on the right coset space $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ using finite Fourier coefficients. The convergence/error analysis of finite Fourier coefficients are investigated. Conditions are established for the finite Fourier coefficients to converge to the Fourier coefficients. The matrix forms of the finite transforms are discussed. The implementation of the discrete method to compute numerical approximation of $SE(2)$-convolutions with functions which are radial in translations are considered. The paper is concluded by discussing capability of the numerical scheme to develop fast algorithms for approximating multiple convolutions with functions with are radial in translations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the "profinite direct sum" is a good notion of infinite direct sums for profinite modules having properties similar to direct sums of abstract modules. For example, the profinite direct sum of projective modules is projective, and there is a Mackey's Formula for profinite modules described using these sums. As an application, we prove that the class of profinite groups of type $\Phi_R$ is closed under subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behaviour of conjugacy languages in virtual graph products, extending results by Ciobanu, Hermiller, Holt and Rees. We focus primarily on virtual graph products in the form of a semi-direct product. First, we study the behaviour of twisted conjugacy representatives in right-angled Artin and Coxeter groups. We prove regularity of the conjugacy geodesic language for virtual graph products in certain cases, and highlight properties of the spherical conjugacy language, depending on the automorphism and ordering on the generating set. Finally, we give a criterion for when the spherical conjugacy language is not unambiguous context-free for virtual graph products. We can extend this further in the case of virtual RAAGs, to show the spherical conjugacy language is not context-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a structural description of finite nilpotent groups of class at most $2$ using a specified number of subdirect and central products of $2$-generated such groups. As a corollary, we show that all of these groups are isomorphic to a subgroup of a Heisenberg group satisfying certain properties. The motivation for these results is of topological nature as they can be used to give lower bounds to the nilpotently Jordan property of the birational automorphism group of varieties and the homeomorphism group of compact manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a coarse algebraic invariant for coarse groups and use it to differentiate various coarsifications of the group of integers. This lets us answer two questions posed by Leitner and the second author. The invariant is obtained by considering the set of exponents n such that taking n-th powers defines a coarse equivalence of the coarse group.</description>

      <title>Almost and quasi Leinster groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the parallelism between perfect numbers and Leinster groups and continue it by introducing the new concepts of almost and quasi Leinster groups which parallel almost and quasi perfect numbers. These are small deviations from perfect numbers; very few results and/or examples are known about them.
  We investigate nilpotent almost-/quasi-/Leinster groups and find some examples and conditions for the existence of such groups for classes of non-nilpotent groups: ZM (Zassenhaus metacyclic) groups, dihedral generalised groups, generalised dyciclic groups and affine groups.</description>

      <title>Continuous two-valued discrete-time dynamical systems and actions of two-valued groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study continuous 2-valued dynamical systems with discrete time (dynamics) on $\mathbb{C}$. The main question addressed is whether a 2-valued dynamics can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group. We construct a class of strongly invertible continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\mathbb{C}$ such that none of these dynamics can be given by the action of any 2-valued group. We also construct an example of a continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\mathbb{C}$ that is not strongly invertible but can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group.</description>

      <title>Definable convolution and idempotent Keisler measures III. Generic stability, generic transitivity, and revised Newelski's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study idempotent measures and the structure of the convolution semigroups of measures over definable groups. We isolate the property of generic transitivity and demonstrate that it is sufficient (and necessary) to develop stable group theory localizing on a generically stable type, including invariant stratified ranks and connected components. We establish generic transitivity of generically stable idempotent types in important new cases, including abelian groups in arbitrary theories and arbitrary groups in rosy theories, and characterize them as generics of connected type-definable subgroups. Using tools from Keisler's randomization theory, we generalize some of these results from types to generically stable Keisler measures, and classify idempotent generically stable measures in abelian groups as (unique) translation-invariant measures on type-definable fsg subgroups. This provides a partial definable counterpart to the classical work of Rudin, Cohen and Pym for locally compact topological groups. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of a minimal left ideal in the convolution semigroup of measures for an arbitrary countable NIP group, from a minimal left ideal in the corresponding semigroup on types and a canonical measure constructed on its ideal subgroup. In order to achieve it, we in particular prove the revised Ellis group conjecture of Newelski for countable NIP groups.</description>

      <title>Spatial models for boolean actions in the infinite measure-preserving setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that up to a null set, every infinite measure-preserving action of a locally compact Polish group can be turned into a continuous measure-preserving action on a locally compact Polish space where the underlying measure is Radon. We also investigate the distinction between spatial and boolean actions in the infinite measure-preserving setup. In particular, we extend Kwiatkowska and Solecki's Point Realization Theorem to the infinite measure setup. We finally obtain a streamlined proof of a recent result of Avraham-Re'em and Roy: L\'evy groups cannot admit nontrivial continuous measure-preserving actions on Polish spaces when the measure is locally finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every non-trivial ordered abelian group $G$ is augmentable by infinite elements, i.e., we have $G\preccurlyeq H\oplus G$ for some non-trivial ordered abelian group $H$. As an application, we show that when $k$ is a field of characteristic 0, then $k$ is not $t$-henselian if and only if all henselian valuations with residue field $k$ are ($\emptyset$-)definable.</description>
