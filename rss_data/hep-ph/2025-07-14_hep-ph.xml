      <title>Dark, deep, deconfining: Phase transitions in neutron stars as powerful probes of hidden sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interiors of neutron stars enjoy ideal conditions for the conversion of hadrons to a strange quark phase, theorized to be the stablest form of matter. Though numerous astrophysical means to prompt such a deconfinement phase transition have been suggested, they may be pre-empted by a large energy barrier for nucleation of quark matter droplets. We will show that interactions of hidden sectors of particles with nucleons may surmount the barrier if it exceeds deca-GeV energies, and spark a phase transition. The neutron star would then, depending on the equation of state of QCD matter, convert to a black hole and/or set off a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Using the observed existence of ancient neutron stars and estimates of the GRB rate, we then set some of the strictest (albeit conditional) limits on dark matter scatters, annihilations, and decays that are tens of orders stronger than those from terrestrial searches. For smaller energy barriers, lower limits on nucleon decay lifetimes of the order of $10^{64}$~yr may be obtained</description>

      <title>Quark flavors in hot and dense holographic QCD: setup and comparison to data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a flavor dependent holographic framework for hot and dense QCD. To this end, we generalize a class of bottom-up holographic models for QCD in the Veneziano limit (V-QCD) by incorporating explicit flavor dependence. Specifically, we develop a $2+1$ flavor model characterized by two massless light quarks and a massive strange quark. Including the non-zero quark mass modifies the tachyon dependence of the model action, which yields a good agreement with the lattice data for thermodynamics in QCD in the low baryon number density and high temperature limit. We compare the model with various hadron resonance gas models at low temperature. We also compute the equation of state (EOS) at high density and low temperatures and found a smooth matching of this EOS with the nuclear matter EOS, suggesting significantly lower latent heat of the nuclear to quark matter transition than in earlier version of the V-QCD model. We observe that the smooth matching with the nuclear theory EOS is only applicable to a subset of potentials; furthermore, constraining the predictions of the model by limiting the potential parameters. We also identify the relevant fixed points of the model, particularly AdS$_2$ and AdS$_5$ fixed points.</description>

      <title>Chiral and Deconfinement Transitions in Spin-Polarized Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of spin polarization in strongly interacting matter by introducing a finite spin potential, $\mu_\Sigma$, which effectively controls the spin density of the system without requiring rotation or specific boundary conditions. Inspired by recent lattice QCD simulations that incorporated such a potential, we implement this approach within an effective QCD framework. Our results show that increasing spin polarization leads to a simultaneous decrease in both the chiral and deconfinement restoration temperatures. The resulting phase structure is qualitatively consistent with lattice findings, and notably, we observe the emergence of a first-order chiral phase transition at low temperature. These results suggest that spin-polarized environments can significantly impact the QCD phase diagram and offer a controlled route for studying spin effects in hot and dense matter.</description>

      <title>Large Relativistic Corrections to Nonrelativistic $M1$ Transitions in Heavy Quarkonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As double heavy quarkonia, charmonium and bottomonium are generally considered to have small relativistic corrections and can be treated using nonrelativistic models. However, this is not always the case. In this paper, we employ the relativistic Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation method to calculate the electromagnetic (EM) radiative decays of heavy quarkonium where the $M1$ transition provides the leading-order contribution. Compared to nonrelativistic method which only computes $M1$ transition, our calculations include $M1+E2+M3+E4$ transitions, where the higher-order multipoles, $E2$, $M3$, and $E4$, account for relativistic corrections. The study finds that relativistic effects are large in such transitions even for bottomonium. For instance: the relativistic corrections in the decays $\psi(nS)\rightarrow\gamma\eta_c(mS)$ ($n\geq m$) range from $68.1\%$ to $83.2\%$, while those for $\Upsilon(nS)\rightarrow\gamma\eta_b(mS)$ range between $65.9\%$ and $75.2\%$.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations and PMNS matrix in gauge-Higgs unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $SO(5) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ gauge-Higgs unification in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped space neutrino oscillations and the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the $W$ couplings originate from Majorana mass terms on the ultraviolet brane in the RS space. Tiny neutrino masses are generated by an inverse seesaw mechanism. The PMNS matrix in the normal ordering with $\delta_{CP}=\pi$ naturally arises consistently with the NuFit-6.0 analysis of neutrino oscillation data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize recent developments in the study of hadron-hadron interactions using lattice QCD near the physical pion mass ($m_{\pi} \simeq 146$ MeV), based on the HAL QCD method and its connection to experimental data. In particular, we focus on several key interaction channels shown below. Also, we examine the two-pion exchange (TPE) mechanism, which governs the long-range behavior of interactions between flavor-singlet hadrons, as well as between nucleons and flavor-singlet hadrons.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic and femtoscopic insights into vector-baryon interactions in the strangeness $-1$ sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the strangeness $-1$ sector of the interaction between vector mesons of the $\rho-$nonet and $1/2^+$ ground state baryons ($VB$), within the unitary coupled-channel hidden gauge formalism. We adopt a renormalization scheme that induces a reasonable short-distance behavior of the two-hadron wave functions, which is the major limitation of femtoscopy techniques at this time. We perform an exhaustive spectroscopy study, implementing different improvements and considerations, and find compatibilities between the poles extracted from the present approach, and some of the states listed in the Review of Particle Physics. Finally, we predict several correlation functions (CFs) associated with various meson-baryon pairs in this sector, paying special attention to the distinctive and clear signatures produced by the dynamically generated states. To obtain realistic estimates for the CFs, we have calculated the production weights using the Thermal-FIST package. Such studies will shed light into the odd-parity $\Lambda^*$ and $\Sigma^*$ hadron spectra, up to 2 GeV, and will open the strategy to improve effective field theories by using low-energy constants fitted to femtoscopy data.</description>

      <title>NNLO+PS Double Higgs boson production with top-quark mass corrections in GENEVA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the NNLO QCD corrections to double Higgs boson production at hadron colliders in GENEVA, matched to the parton shower. We include all the known top-quark mass effects and the resummation of large logarithms of the zero-jettiness $\mathcal{T}_0$, up to NNLL$^\prime$ accuracy. This work extends our previous study, which was performed in the $m_t\to \infty$ infinite top-quark mass approximation, providing a more realistic simulation framework for Higgs boson pair production. We validate our approach against NNLO predictions by MATRIX and assess the importance of mass effects comparing with our $m_t\to \infty$ previous implementation.</description>

      <title>Minimal Multi-Majoron Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to provide a natural framework for hierarchical right-handed neutrinos, we propose a realistic ultraviolet complete minimal multi-Majoron model (MMMM). We consider two right-handed neutrinos for simplicity, although the model is readily extendable to more. The minimal model introduces two complex scalar Majoron fields $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, whose couplings to the two respective right-handed neutrinos are controlled by an extra global $U(1)_N$ symmetry. We show that a flavon field is required to facilitate the effective Yukawa couplings, in order to implement the type I seesaw mechanism. We analyse the resulting phenomenology related to neutrino masses, flavour mixing and cosmological predictions concerning the formation and decay of topological defects like the global cosmic strings and the domain walls when the $U(1)_N\times U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry is broken. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is a distinctive combination of the spectrum from the global cosmic string and strong first-order phase transitions when the symmetries are broken, the strength of the latter being enhanced by the second Majoron field. The resulting characteristic spectrum determines the two right-handed neutrino mass scales within the considered framework.</description>

      <title>Searching for the neutral triple gauge couplings in the process $\mu^+\mu^-\to \gamma \nu\bar{\nu}$ at muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of future high-energy muon colliders to neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) through the process $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\to\gamma\nu\bar{\nu}$ within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. Extending beyond previous studies, we consider a set of 14 dimension-8 operators, including both Higgs-related and pure gauge structures. By computing the cross sections and performing Monte Carlo simulations at multiple center-of-mass energies (3 - 30 TeV), we demonstrate that the annihilation process dominates over vector boson fusion (VBF) at TeV scales. We also explore the impact of beam polarization and show that the $(-+)$ polarization enhances sensitivity to several operators. After the study of the event selection strategies, we show that muon colliders can impose stronger expected constraints on nTGCs operators than current LHC bounds, with two of the pure gauge operators yielding the most stringent expected constraints.</description>

      <title>Spirals, vortices, and helicity entanglements in dynamical Sauter-Schwinger pair creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study helicity correlations of electron-positron pairs created by a homogeneous time-dependent electric field in the Sauter-Schwinger scenario. Our analysis is based on solving the Dirac equation with the Feynman or anti-Feynman boundary conditions, which is equivalent to the scattering matrix approach widely used in high energy physics. Most importantly, both these methods allow to fully account for the helicity (or, more generally, spin) correlations of created particles. The influence of helicity correlations and the carrier-envelope phase of the electric pulse on the properties of topological structures (such as spirals and vortices) in momentum distributions of created particles is investigated. The generation of maximally entangled helicity states is discussed and the possibility of using a short electric pulse as a fast switch between them is indicated.</description>

      <title>Thermal Gravitons from Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In warm inflation (WI), the persistent thermal bath that is sustained by dissipative interactions with the inflaton field produces a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we study the production and evolution of these GWs. Specifically, we investigate the emission of thermal gravitons (gravitons emitted by a thermal bath) from particle scattering in the bath and the evolution of the corresponding GWs. We find that the bulk of thermal graviton production in WI occurs during the transition to radiation domination after inflation. Further, the energy density of thermal gravitons is enhanced by roughly one to two orders of magnitude compared to that in a radiation-dominated scenario with the same reheating temperature. We also calculate the spectrum of the resulting stochastic GW background and find that it has a distinctive shape, consisting of a peak at high frequencies ~100 GHz and an almost flat spectrum extending to low frequencies. The peak arises from emission of sub-horizon modes that follow the temperature of the bath. The flat part of the spectrum corresponds to the modes that exit the horizon during WI and re-enter during radiation domination. We show that the detection prospects for the high-frequency peak of the GW spectrum, while improved slightly compared to the radiation-dominated case, still remain challenging. The thermal spectrum's low-frequency plateau is typically subdominant to the amplitude of the standard vacuum tensor modes from inflation, although WI models can exist where the thermal graviton plateau surpasses the vacuum contribution without exceeding current observational limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Furthermore, we calculate the thermal graviton contribution from WI to dark radiation and show that WI models are generally expected to satisfy current observational bounds, including those from the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Lattice investigation of custodial two-Higgs-doublet model at weak quartic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, which shares the same global-symmetry properties with the standard model, is studied non-perturbatively on the lattice. The additional Higgs doublet enlarges the scalar spectrum and opens the possibility for spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry. In this work we start by showing the occurrence of spontaneous breaking of the custodial symmetry in a region of the parameter space of the model. Following this, both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling are examined at weak quartic couplings in the presence of the custodial symmetry. The calculations are performed with energy cutoffs ranging from 300 to 600 GeV on a line of constant standard model physics, obtained by tuning bare couplings to fix the ratio between the masses of the Higgs and the $W$ bosons, as well as the value of the renormalized gauge coupling at the scale of the $W$ boson mass. The realizable masses for the additional scalar states are explored. For the choice of bare quartic couplings in this work, the estimated lower bound of these masses is found to be well below the $W$ boson mass, and independent of the cutoff. We also study the finite temperature electroweak transition along this line of constant standard model physics, revealing properties of a smooth crossover behavior.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Hill's equation parameters and application to cosmic reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation provides a compelling framework for explaining several observed features of our Universe, but its viability depends on an efficient reheating phase that converts the inflaton's energy into Standard Model particles. This conversion often proceeds through non-perturbative mechanisms such as parametric resonance, which is described by Hill's equation. In this work, we investigate how stochastic fluctuations in the parameters of Hill's equation can influence particle production during reheating. We show that such fluctuations can arise from couplings to light scalar fields, and can significantly alter the stability bands in the resonance structure, thereby enhancing the growth of fluctuations and broadening the region of efficient energy transfer. Using random matrix theory and stochastic differential equations, we decompose the particle growth rate into deterministic and noise-induced components and demonstrate analytically and numerically that even modest noise leads to substantial particle production in otherwise stable regimes. These results suggest that stochastic effects can robustly enhance the efficacy of reheating across a wide swath of parameter space, with implications for early Universe cosmology, UV completions involving multiple scalar fields, and the resolution of the cosmological moduli problem.</description>

      <title>Constraining decaying dark matter models with gravitational lensing and cosmic voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite overwhelming observational evidence for dark matter, we still have no evidence of direct detection. Consequently, our knowledge about dark matter is limited, for example, we do not know if dark matter is a stable particle or if it decays. Without a theoretical particle model, the parameter space of possible decay models is highly variable, and astrophysical or cosmological means of indirectly constraining the phenomenological models are required. This paper investigates a scenario in which a dark matter decays and the dark daughter particle moves with respect to the comoving mother particle. The model is parameterised by the decay rate and the injection velocity of the dark matter particles, which can be converted to the mass ratio. In previous work, a simpler model was used to investigate the evolution of cosmic voids typified as regions with low content of galaxies and non-baryonic matter. It was found that the growth of S-type voids is modified by the dark matter decay, leading to imprints at the present day. Here we extend our study and improve the method used to model the decay. We also study the gravitational weak-lensing signal that will be able to detect or constrain the parameter space of decaying dark matter. The results of this study suggest that future weak lensing surveys may provide unique probes of the phenomological parameters of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: Since 2021, the Open Data Portal has provided access to the Pierre Auger Observatory's data for both the scientific community and the general public. The data release process has been in place since the Observatory's foundation. It continues to be strengthened as outlined in the approved policy and the Observatory's Data Management Plan. More than 80 000 cosmic-ray events above $10^{17}$ eV, detected with the surface and fluorescence detectors, have been released at various levels, from calibrated traces to high-level reconstruction parameters. Additionally, atmospheric data and low-energy particle counting rates have been made available for space weather studies. The Collaboration is committed to releasing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data, along with accompanying software and detailed documentation, enabling users to perform their own queries and analyses for both research and educational purposes. These datasets have already served as a basis for several scientific papers and have been widely used in various outreach activities. After 20 years of stable data acquisition, the Pierre Auger Collaboration will disclose 30% of the cosmic ray events above $2.5 \cdot 10^{18}$ eV collected with the main surface detector array between 2004 and 2022, corresponding to an exposure of about 24 000 km$^2$ sr yr, together with events detected with the fluorescence detector and used for energy calibration. This release will provide an unprecedented public dataset for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, enabling in-depth studies of their properties. Together with the published catalog of the 100 most energetic events recorded, this initiative represents the Pierre Auger Collaboration's strong commitment to distributed and collective knowledge, sharing progress with the entire scientific community.</description>

      <title>Limits on WIMP-Scattering Cross Sections using Solar Neutrinos with Ten Years of IceCube Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although dark matter (DM) comprises 84\% of the matter content of the Universe, its nature remains unknown. One broad class of particle DM motivated by extensions of the Standard Model (SM) is weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Generically, WIMPs will scatter off nuclei in large celestial bodies such as the Sun, thus becoming gravitationally bound. Subsequently, WIMPs can annihilate to stable SM particles, ultimately releasing most of their energy as high-energy neutrinos which escape from the Sun. Thus, an excess of neutrinos from the Sun's direction would be evidence for WIMPs. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is well-suited to such searches since it is sensitive to WIMPs with masses in the region preferred by supersymmetric extensions of the SM. I will present the results of IceCube's most recent solar WIMP search, which includes all neutrino flavors, covers the WIMP mass range from 20 GeV to 10 TeV, and has world-leading sensitivity over this entire range for most channels considered.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Diffusion of $e^\pm$ in Pulsar Halos over Multiple Coherence of Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The slow particle diffusion in pulsar halos, inferred from TeV gamma-ray surface brightness profiles, is attributed to cross-field diffusion under the anisotropic diffusion model. This model assumes sub-Alfv\'enic interstellar turbulence in the surrounding medium of the pulsar and a rough alignment of the line-of-sight of observers towards the pulsars with the local mean magnetic field direction in the halo. In this model, the expected morphology of a pulsar halo is highly dependent on the properties of the interstellar magnetic field. We investigate the anisotropic diffusion of electron-positron pairs across multiple coherence of magnetic fields in pulsar halos in this work. We focus particularly on their influences on the predicted gamma-ray surface brightness profile and the asymmetry of the halo's morphology, as well as the observational expectations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our results indicate that the requirement of a specific magnetic field geometry can be alleviated when accounting for a limited (and realistic) coherence length of the magnetic field in the model. Also, the halo's morphology may appear less asymmetric, especially after being smoothed by the point spread function of instruments. It largely relaxes the tension between the asymmetric morphology of halos predicted by the model and lack of apparent asymmetric halos detected so far. Our findings demonstrate the important influence of the coherence length of interstellar magnetic field on the distribution of particles around their accelerators, and the consequence on the measured source morphology.</description>

Abstract: We present an update on the arrival-direction analyses conducted on intermediate angular scales using the complete Phase I data of the Pierre Auger Observatory up to the end of $2022$ with a total exposure of $135{,}000\,\text{km}^2\,\text{sr}\,\text{yr}$. We show the arrival-direction distribution of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays along the supergalactic plane above $20\,\text{EeV}$, and an update in the search for magnetically-induced signatures in the arrival directions. Furthermore, we present the potential of introducing estimators for the rigidity ordering of the events to enhance arrival-direction analyses on small to intermediate angular scales. To achieve this, we take advantage of two estimators working on the response of the surface detector: an analytical fit based on air-shower universality and a deep neural network.</description>

      <title>Event reconstruction with the Radio detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory has recently been upgraded with the addition of radio antennas, forming the radio detector (RD). This contribution outlines the standard methods for reconstructing extensive air showers using the RD, along with recent developments. The reconstruction pipeline is based on a robust understanding of the detector itself. The entire instrument, including the antenna pattern and analog chain, has been meticulously characterized within the Offline software framework, based on measurements in the laboratory as well as in the field. To ensure data integrity, stations identified as unreliable through monitoring are excluded before event reconstruction. Absolute calibration is achieved at the 5 percent level by analyzing the diffuse galactic radio emission. Next, the electric field that induced voltages in the antenna is calculated by unfolding the antenna response pattern. Key observables, such as the energy fluence (the energy deposited in the ground per unit area) and the arrival time of the pulse, are then determined. With these quantities, shower parameters can be reconstructed with very good accuracy in two chi-square-minimization fits: one to determine the shower's arrival direction via a spherical wavefront fit (predicted within 0.2 degree), and the other to estimate the distance to the shower maximum and the electromagnetic cascade energy (predicted within 5 percent) using a lateral density function</description>

      <title>Spectra for the Vacuum Cherenkov Effect in Astrophysical Electromagnetic Cascades with Lorentz Invariance Violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation is a feature of several quantum gravity models in which Lorentz symmetry is broken at high energies, possibly leading to changes in particle behavior and interactions. In this work, we investigate vacuum Cherenkov radiation, a reaction in which an electron spontaneously emits a photon. This process, forbidden when Lorentz symmetry is unbroken, is a phenomenological consequence of some quantum gravity models. We derive, for the first time, the spectra for the vacuum Cherenkov reaction, and confirm our results numerically. These results can be used to derive limits on Lorentz invariance violation.</description>

      <title>Growth of Cosmic Structures in generalized mass-to-horizon relation Entropic Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of cosmic structures in the thermodynamically consistent generalised mass-to-horizon entropic cosmology (MHEC). For the Bekenstein case the entropic energy density augments the Friedmann equations without modifying the Hawking temperature and automatically satisfies the Clausius relation, thereby avoiding the inconsistencies that afflicted earlier entropy-force models. We then derive the linear perturbation equations, emphasising the distinction between a fully perturbed interaction term and the common approximation in which the perturbation is neglected. Numerical solutions show that fully perturbed follows the LCDM matter-growth history within the current growth uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that MHEC matches both background and growth probes as well as LCDM without extra free parameters, providing a viable entropic explanation for recent accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Hubble tension with a cascade decaying dark matter sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hubble tension can be alleviated by altering either early- or late-time $\Lambda$CDM. So far, extensive studies have shown that only early dark energy or ad hoc combinations of those two-fold effects can reduce the tension to $3\sigma$ or lower. In this work, we improve the later solution by considering a cascade decaying dark matter sector, where a parent particle produces relativistic dark matter in the early Universe and the dark matter subsequently decays to neutrinos in the late-time Universe. We parametrize this model with four model parameters, carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit to Planck 2018+BAO+Pantheon data sets, and compare it to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits, neutrino flux bounds, and Planck and SDSS data about matter power spectra. Within parameter regions reducing the Hubble tension to $3.2\sigma$ and compatible with the existing constraints, the main phenomenological features include a larger $S_{8}\sim 0.84$, smaller $n_{s}\sim 0.95$ and larger matter power spectra relative to the $\Lambda$CDM, which are left for future tests.</description>

Abstract: The upgrade of Pierre Auger Observatory, AugerPrime, is a multi-hybrid system designed to improve the sensitivity and precision of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray measurements. It includes scintillator detectors positioned both atop the enhanced Water-Cherenkov detectors and buried nearby for direct muon measurements, along with radio and fluorescence detectors. In this contribution, we present an overview of the monitoring tools developed for all the components of AugerPrime, focusing on real-time performance assessment and long-term stability metrics. By continuously tracking key parameters, we can identify potential issues early, enabling timely interventions and improving overall data quality. These strategies are crucial for maintaining the long-term reliability of the measurements taken at the Auger Observatory and providing high-quality data for cosmic ray research in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Quantum production of gravitational waves after inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of mechanisms in the early Universe lead to the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). We introduce here a novel source of GWs generated by vacuum fluctuations after inflation. Being gravitons minimally coupled particles, their quantum creation takes place during inflation, but is absent in an unperturbed Universe during the radiation-dominated epoch, since they behave as conformally invariant particles. However, the presence of inhomogeneities breaks the conformal flatness of the metric, allowing scalar metric perturbations to induce the quantum production of gravitons. We compute the resulting GW spectrum from this mechanism for different models of the primordial scalar power spectrum. We find that this GW signal peaks around the GHz frequency range, distinguishing it from other astrophysical and cosmological backgrounds and underscoring the need for detectors sensitive to these high frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory is a hybrid detector designed to observe and study ultra-high-energy particles of extraterrestrial origin. With its 27 fluorescence telescopes and over 1600 autonomously operating water-Cherenkov detectors spread over an area of 3000 km$^2$, it is world-leading in terms of exposure to cosmic rays and offers an unparalleled window into the physical processes that happen at energy scales unattainable by particle accelerators on Earth. Measurement information of candidate air-shower events from all associated detectors and telescopes is collected at a central data-acquisition system located in the nearby town of Malarg\"ue, and processed for higher-level physics analysis. On top of this, data for monitoring the long-term stability and operation of the observatory is forwarded to the central server as well. In this work, we briefly review the central data-acquisition system of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We examine the rates, efficiencies, and purity of detected events for Phase II of the Pierre Auger Observatory and compare them to performance parameters during Phase I. We detail challenges in the event detection up until now and present recent changes in the central data acquisition system and local station software that aim to streamline the data acquisition chain.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum dynamics of vortex particles in accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments with spin-polarized beams of leptons and hadrons typically employ plane-wave states with definite momenta and energies. In contrast, vortex states represent cylindrical waves carrying a well-defined orbital angular momentum projection along the propagation direction. This projection can be arbitrarily large, endowing such particles with magnetic moments orders of magnitude greater than those of plane-wave states. Consequently, vortex particles could complement - or even replace - spin-polarized beams in high-energy collisions, enabling access to observables beyond the reach of the conventional states. Although relativistic vortex beams have yet to be realized, we investigate the radiative and non-radiative dynamics of angular momentum for vortex particles in accelerators. We compute the timescale for angular momentum loss via photon emission, finding it significantly longer than typical acceleration times. The non-radiative dynamics is governed by precession, with the orbital angular momentum precessing at a frequency markedly different from that of spin. Similar to spin tunes in circular accelerators, this can induce resonances that disrupt the beam's orbital momentum - occurring far more frequently for vortex beams than for spin-polarized ones. Thus, vortex particle acceleration can be more feasible in linacs, while Siberian snakes could serve as a tool for angular momentum manipulations.</description>

In this paper, we present a systematic framework for deriving NREFTs from relativistic theories with generic self-interactions. Our approach allows for (but is not limited to) non-power-law potentials (such as those arising from dilatons or axions) or potentials that are non-analytic around the classical vacuum (such as those with logarithmic radiative corrections). These are of theoretical and phenomenological interest but have largely been unexplored in the non-relativistic regime. NREFTs are typically viewed as approximations for systems with low velocities, weak couplings, and small field amplitudes. The latter assumption is relaxed in our approach, as long as the mass term remains dominant (ensuring the validity of the non-relativistic limit). Additionally, we establish an effective fluid description for the non-relativistic scalar field, identifying key quantities such as energy density, pressure, and sound speed. To enable cosmological applications, we extend our formalism to account for the expanding universe, providing a reliable tool for investigating ultra-light dark matter models with arbitrary self-interactions. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our NREFT in analyzing solitons, which is also relevant to cosmology for studying celestial objects such as boson stars and the cores of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure for Mixed Dark Matter Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of the perturbative nonlinear dynamics of cosmological fluctuations in dark sectors comprising a fraction of non-cold dark matter, for example ultra-light axions or light thermal relics. These mixed dark matter scenarios exhibit suppressed growth of perturbations below a characteristic, cosmologically relevant, scale associated with the microscopic nature of the non-cold species. As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear solutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not, in general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark matter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound speed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible and devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the evaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe mixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a first application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the energy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Our refined theoretical modeling leads to somewhat weaker bounds compared to previous analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that logarithmically enhanced infra-red loop corrections arising in theories with four derivatives correspond to a physical running of couplings, rendering quadratic gravity asymptotically free. We find that these effects depend on the gauge and on the field parameterisation. We compute physical on-shell amplitudes and find genuine infra-red log-enhanced loop corrections, that are process-dependent and cannot be absorbed into running couplings. As a byproduct, we derive the effective action of quadratic gravity at tree level, showing that its ghost does not contribute to effective operators and thereby does not violate positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Momentum Spectra of pair created in a pulsed field at finite times: Are Oscillations "Real"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the mechanism of production of electron-positron pairs from the vacuum in a time-varying, spatially uniform pulsed electric field. We analytically compute the probability of $(e^+ e^-) $pair production in momentum space using the exact solution of the one-particle time-dependent Dirac equation and compare the result with quantum kinetic theory (QKT). Both approaches allow us to study the particle momentum spectrum at any instant in time and can potentially unveil valuable information regarding quantum non-equilibrium physics. We analyze both approaches' momentum spectra of the created particles at any instant. We observe a multi-profile structure in the LMS. This multi-profile structure clearly illustrates the quantum interference effects associated with pair production. It is worth noting that both approaches exhibit quantum interference patterns at finite times, manifested as oscillations observed in the LMS. We highlight that this quantum signature is a universal behavior seen in the momentum spectra at finite times, where the electric field is nearly zero.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the mechanism of $J/\psi$-nucleon scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy $J/\psi N$ scattering is important for various reasons: it is related to the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquark states, provides insights into the role of gluons in nucleon structures, and is relevant to the $J/\psi$ properties in nuclear medium. The scattering can happen through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism via open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. We investigate the $J/\psi N$ $S$-wave scattering length through both mechanisms, and find that the soft-gluon exchange mechanism leads to a scattering length at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism and thus is the predominant one. The findings can be verified by lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of the scattering processes breaking the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.</description>

      <title>On the dark matter origin of an LDMX signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed target experiments where beam electrons are focused upon a thin target have shown great potential for probing new physics, including the sub-GeV dark matter (DM) paradigm. However, a signal in future experiments such as the light dark matter experiment (LDMX) would require an independent validation to assert its DM origin. To this end, we propose to combine LDMX and next generation DM direct detection (DD) data in a four-step analysis strategy, which we here illustrate with Monte Carlo simulations. In the first step, the hypothetical LDMX signal (i.e. an excess in the final state electron energy and transverse momentum distributions) is $\textit{recorded}$. In the second step, a DM DD experiment operates with increasing exposure to test the DM origin of the LDMX signal. Here, LDMX and DD data are simulated. In the third step, a posterior probability density function (pdf) for the DM model parameters is extracted from the DD data, and used to $\textit{predict}$ the electron recoil energy and transverse momentum distributions at LDMX. In the last step, $\textit{predicted}$ and $\textit{recorded}$ electron recoil energy and transverse momentum distributions are compared in a chi-square test. We present the results of this comparison in terms of a threshold exposure that a DD experiment has to operate with to assert whether $\textit{predicted}$ and $\textit{recorded}$ distributions $\textit{can}$ be statistically dependent. We find that this threshold exposure grows with the DM particle mass, $m_\chi$. It varies from 0.012 kg-year for a DM mass of $m_\chi=4$ MeV to 1 kg-year for $m_\chi=25$ MeV, which is or will soon be within reach.</description>

      <title>Exploring QGP-like phenomena with Charmonia in $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultrarelativistic collisions of nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider, the created QCD environment rapidly changes, leading to a non-adiabatic evolution of the quantum states involved. Considering this, we first examine the pre-equilibrium state of QCD matter and its effect on the initially produced charmonium using a temperature-independent Hamiltonian. As the QCD matter reaches local thermal equilibrium, this Hamiltonian transforms to its finite temperature counterpart. To model the pre-equilibrium stage, we use the bottom-up thermalization approach to determine the effective temperature of the QCD matter, followed by a Gubser-type expansion for the thermalized medium. Additionally, we consider collisional damping, gluonic dissociation, and regeneration mechanisms, which specifically modify the charmonium yield in the thermalized medium. Mainly, the gluonic dissociation and collisional damping cause a reduction in the yield conversely, regeneration through gluonic deexcitation enhances the yield of charmonium. Further, we explore the combined effects of these mechanisms on the collective yield of charmonium states with transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and event multiplicity in the proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Based on our findings, we contend that the combined effects of these mechanisms can serve as a robust probe for determining the possible existence of a thermalized QCD medium in such a small collision system.</description>

      <title>Kaon-induced production of strange hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}$ from proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the kaon-induced production of strange hidden-charm pentaquark $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}$ states, including the $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4459)$ and $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)$ observed by the LHCb collaboration. Coupled-channel interactions involving the channels $\bar{K}N$, $\Xi_c^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$, $\Xi'_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$, $\Lambda_c\bar{D}_s^{(*)}$, and $\Lambda J/\psi$ are studied using effective Lagrangians to describe these interactions. The potential kernels are constructed within the one-boson-exchange model and implemented into the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation to calculate the scattering amplitudes. From these amplitudes, the partial-wave cross sections for kaon-induced production are predicted alongside the poles corresponding to strange hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks. The analysis reveals complex structures in the cross sections due to molecular states. A structure near the $\Xi_c\bar{D}$ threshold is predicted in the $\Lambda_c\bar{D}_s$ channel, corresponding to $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)$. Both molecular states near the $\Xi_c\bar{D}^*$ threshold with $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $J^P = 3/2^-$, associated with $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4459)$, produce peaks in the $\Xi'_c\bar{D}$ channel, which vary significantly with the cutoff. Additionally, a molecular state with $J^P = 3/2^-$ near the $\Xi_c^*\bar{D}$ threshold gives rise to a peak in the $\Xi_c\bar{D}^*$ channel. In the higher energy region, from 4350 to 4550 MeV, although the cross sections in the $\Lambda_c\bar{D}_s^{(*)}$ channels are substantial, no distinct structures corresponding to strange hidden-charm pentaquarks are identified, apart from some threshold-related cusps. These results provide valuable theoretical insights and serve as a foundation for future experimental studies of strange hidden-charm pentaquarks using kaon beams at J-PARC and JLab.</description>

      <title>Decaying scalar dark matter in the minimal left-right symmetric model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the minimal left-right symmetric theory, the dark matter candidate is usually ascribed to the lightest right-handed neutrino. Here we present an alternative decaying dark matter candidate in this model in terms of the lightest neutral scalar from the $SU(2)_R$-triplet field. This setup requires a vast hierarchy between the scalar mass and the left-right symmetry breaking scale, which renders the scalar dark matter sufficiently stable on cosmological time scales. The stability of the dark matter imposes constraints on the right-handed neutrino mass, which has consequences for the neutrino mass generation, as well as for leptogenesis. Although somewhat fine-tuned, it provides a very economical scenario wherein the minimal left-right model can simultaneously explain dark matter, neutrino masses, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the production of a CP-even flavon $H_F$ in proton-proton collisions and the prospects for its detection via the diphoton channel at future super hadron colliders, i.e., $pp\to H_F\to\gamma\gamma$. The theoretical framework adopted is a model that invokes the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism with an Abelian flavor symmetry, which includes a Higgs doublet and a complex singlet. We confront the free parameters of the model against theoretical and experimental constraints to find the allowed parameter space, which is then used to evaluate the production cross section of the flavon and the branching ratio of its decay into two photons. We find promising results based on specific benchmark points, achieving signal significances at the level of 5$\sigma$ for flavon masses in the interval $200\lesssim M_{H_F}\lesssim 450$ and integrated luminosities in the range $5-12$ ab$^{-1}$ at the future High-Energy LHC. On the other hand, the Future hadron-hadron Circular Collider could probe masses up to 1 TeV if it reaches an integrated luminosity of at least 2 ab$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Asymmetries: from the early Universe to BBN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large primordial lepton flavor asymmetries with almost vanishing total baryon-minus-lepton number can evade the usual BBN and CMB constraints if neutrino oscillations lead to perfect flavor equilibration. Solving the momentum averaged quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) describing neutrino oscillations and interactions, we perform the first systematic investigation of this scenario, uncovering a rich flavor structure in stark contradiction to the assumption of simple flavor equilibration. We find (i) a particular direction in flavor space, $\Delta n_e \simeq -2/3 \, (-1) \Delta n_\mu$ for normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, in which the flavor equilibration is efficient and primordial asymmetries are essentially unconstrained, (ii) a minimal washout factor, $\Delta n_e^2|_\mathrm{BBN} \leq 0.03 \, (0.016) \sum_\alpha \Delta n_\alpha^2|_{\mathrm{ini}}$ yielding a conservative estimate for the allowed primordial asymmetries in a generic flavor direction, and (iii) particularly strong or weak washout if one of the initial flavor asymmetries vanishes due to non-adiabatic muon- or electron-driven MSW transitions. These results open up the possibility of a first-order QCD phase transition facilitated by large lepton asymmetries as well as baryogenesis from large and compensated $\Delta n_e =- \Delta n_\mu$ asymmetries. Our first-principles approach of deriving momentum averaged QKEs includes collision terms beyond the damping approximation, energy transfer between the neutrino and electron-photon plasma, and provides a fast and reliable way to investigate the impact of primordial lepton asymmetries at the time of BBN. We publicly release the Mathematica code COFLASY-M on GitHub which solves the QKEs numerically.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Electroweak Phase Transitions: Thermal History and Dynamics from Bubble Nucleation to Percolation</title>

Abstract: The electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is crucial for cosmology and particle physics, with a profound impact on electroweak baryogenesis, symmetry breaking, and gravitational wave (GW) signals. However, many studies overlook key aspects of EWPT dynamics, leading to misidentified patterns and overestimated GW signals. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive framework for analyzing EWPTs, focusing on the vacuum's thermal history and dynamics from bubble nucleation to percolation. Using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd real scalar singlet model, we demonstrate the occurrence of spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking in the high-temperature vacuum, leading to diverse EWPT processes, including multi-step transitions and inverse symmetry breaking. We identify four distinct EWPT patterns, each characterized by unique symmetry-breaking mechanisms and associated with bubbles exhibiting distinct field configurations, which can be analyzed using a formalism based on energy density distributions developed here. A key finding is that bubble nucleation fails in extremely strong phase transitions (PTs) with low nucleation rates, or in ultra-fast PTs involving inverse $s$-bubbles that collapse instantly upon formation, both of which lead to false vacuum trapping and the absence of observable GW signals. In first-order PTs where nucleation succeeds, stronger transitions occur later in the universe's evolution, while weaker transitions proceed more rapidly. Multi-step transitions involving (inverse) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking give rise to complex transition sequences and exotic bubble dynamics, such as sequential nucleation or the coexistence of bubbles from different vacua -- phenomena with significant implications for GW spectra, dark matter, and baryogenesis. This work advances our understanding of EWPT dynamics and lays the groundwork for future studies of EWPTs in BSM physics.</description>

      <title>Reweighting and Analysing Event Generator Systematics by Neural Networks on High-Level Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models for jet classification use jet constituent information directly, improving performance tremendously. This draws attention to interpretability, namely, the decision-making process, correlations contributing to the classification, and high-level features (HLFs) representing the difference between signal and background. We address the interpretability issue using a modular architecture called the analysis model (AM), which combines several motivated HLFs as the input. We focus on the generator systematics of the top vs. QCD classification by one of the best classifiers, Particle Transformer (ParT). Taking commonly used event generators Pythia (PY) and Herwig (HW) as examples, we demonstrate that the event weights estimated by the AM generator classifier align the HW classification score distribution to PY ones for QCD jets, with small training uncertainty. This suggests the AM is sufficient to describe simulated QCD jet features with relatively few observables, and generator systematics would also be reduced by reweighting the simulation by data. On the other hand, large event weights are required for QCD-like top jets, which leads to imperfect reweighting for both AM and ParT generator classifiers. Moreover, the AM HLFs are insufficient for describing PY and HW differences, causing lower reweighting accuracy compared with ParT. The missing features are the correlation among the collimated high-energy jet constituents, which are strongly correlated to the energy flow polynomials (EFPs) selected for top vs. QCD classification, showing the complementarity between AM HLFs and the selected EFPs.</description>

      <title>Implications of recent Higgs data for the light Higgs bosons in the GNMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the parameter space of the GNMSSM featuring light Higgs bosons, with a focus on the exotic decay of the 125 GeV Higgs boson ($h$) into pairs of the lightest CP-odd ($a_1$) or CP-even ($h_1$) Higgs bosons under constraints from recent Higgs data. We perform an initial scan of the parameter space under basic constraints from \textsf{HiggsSignals-2.6.2} and \textsf{HiggsBounds-5.10.2}, followed by the application of comprehensive constraints using the \textsf{HiggsTools} framework. Comparative analysis reveals that \textsf{HiggsTools} imposes significantly more stringent constraints than its legacy components alone. Furthermore, its exclusion capability substantially surpasses that of ATLAS direct searches targeting individual decay channel.
  By analyzing the distinct constraining effects of the subpackages \textsf{HiggsSignals} and \textsf{HiggsBounds} within \textsf{HiggsTools}, we find \textsf{HiggsBounds} constraints to be dominant across both the $h_1$ and $h_2$ scenarios. Nearly all parameter points excluded by \textsf{HiggsSignals} or direct LHC decay channel analyses are also excluded by \textsf{HiggsBounds}, attributable to the direct constraints \textsf{HiggsBounds} provides for non-SM Higgs searches, in contrast to the indirect constraints from \textsf{HiggsSignals}. In the $h_2$ scenario, \textsf{HiggsSignals} can exclude points with suppressed $Br(h \to a_1 a_1 \to \tau\tau bb)$ due to the kinematically accessible decay $h_2 \to h_1 h_1$, which exhibits large branching fractions and modifies SM-like Higgs properties. Our analysis shows that experimental data require the observed $h$ boson to be predominantly SM-like in both scenarios. Specifically, in the $h_2$ scenario, the lighter singlet-dominated state $h_s$ must possess high singlet purity and negligible SM-like components.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the pion in the self-consistent light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent light-front quark model (LFQM) analysis of the pion's gravitational form factors (GFFs), incorporating the Bakamjian-Thomas (BT) construction consistently throughout the framework. By uniformly applying the BT formalism to both hadronic matrix elements and their associated Lorentz structures, we achieve a current-component-independent extraction of the pion GFFs $A_\pi(t)$ and $D_\pi(t)$, thereby eliminating the light-front zero-mode ambiguities that typically hinder conventional LFQM approaches. By tuning the model parameters, we identify an optimal set that successfully reproduces the decay constant and electromagnetic form factor of the pion, while yielding a $D$-term value $D_\pi(0) \approx -1$, consistent with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. The $D$-term emerges as a sensitive probe of the pion's internal dynamics, governing its mechanical radius -- the largest among the charge, mass, and mechanical radii. We further examine the pion's spatial structure via its associated two-dimensional light-front densities, including the momentum density, transverse pressure, and shear stress, all of which satisfy the required normalization and von Laue stability conditions. Our results reveal a detailed mechanical landscape: a centrally peaked momentum density that decreases monotonically; a repulsive pressure near the center (up to $x_\perp = 0.33$~fm) that transitions to attraction in the outer region; and a shear stress profile peaking at an intermediate distance ($x_\perp \approx 0.2$~fm).</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories from $S$- and $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^*$ interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the $S$- and $P$-wave interactions of the $D\bar{D}^*$ system within the framework of the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation, with the aim of exploring possible molecular states and their corresponding pole trajectories. The interaction potentials are constructed using the one-boson-exchange model, incorporating the exchanges of $\pi$, $\eta$, $\rho$, $\omega$, $\sigma$, and $J/\psi$ mesons, based on heavy quark effective Lagrangians. The poles of the scattering amplitude are analyzed and their evolution on two Riemann sheets is systematically traced as the cutoff parameter increases up to 5 GeV. We identify four molecular states arising from the $S$-wave $D\bar{D}^*$ interaction. Among them, the bound state with quantum numbers $I^G(J^{PC}) = 0^+(1^{++})$ corresponds well to the experimentally observed $X(3872)$, while its isovector partner with $I^G(J^{PC})= 1^-(1^{++})$ is found to exist only as a virtual state. Additionally, a $0^-(1^{+-})$ state appears as a bound state. The isovector $1^{+-}$ state, which may be associated with the $Z_c(3900)$, is observed to evolve from a bound state to a virtual state as the interaction strength decreases. For the $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^*$ interaction, the structure $G(3900)$ recently observed at BESIII is likely connected to a $0^-(1^{--})$ state. A $0^+(0^{-+})$ state is also predicted in this channel. Both can appear as either resonance or bound/virtual state depending on the interaction strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic calculation of the integrated double-emission eikonal function of a massive and a massless emitter whose momenta are at an arbitrary angle to each other. This quantity provides one of the required ingredients for extending the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme to processes with massive final-state particles. To calculate it, we use the standard methodology involving reverse unitarity and its extension to cases with Heaviside functions, integration-by-parts technology and reduction to master integrals, and differential equations. In addition, we also describe a semi-numerical method based on the subtraction of infra-red and collinear singularities from the eikonal function, allowing us to extract divergences of the integrated eikonal function analytically, and to derive a simple integral representation for the finite remainder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical diquark model describes multiquark exotic hadrons in terms of diquark components nucleated by heavy quarks, and successfully explains multiple features of hidden-charm and -bottom exotics. Here we apply the model to the marginally heavy case of hidden-strange states to probe whether mesons near 2 GeV with peculiar properties, such as $\phi(2170)$, $f_2(2340)$, and X(2370), are possible tetraquark candidates. We calculate spin-multiplet average masses using potentials obtained through lattice simulations and quark models, and we also describe the detailed spectra of the expected multiplets as a diagnostic to discern the nature of future hadrons likely to be discovered in this mass region by experiments at facilities such as BESIII, JLab, and the EIC.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic and Extrinsic Hierarchy Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hierarchy Problem of elementary particle physics can be divided into two separate problems: the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Hierarchy Problems. The Intrinsic Hierarchy Problem (IHP) arises when the Wilsonian renormalization group induces a large Lambda_UV cutoff dependence on a much lighter scalar mass, creating a large finetuning. The Extrinsic Hierarchy Problem (EHP) arises when the IR theory is augmented with generically assumed extra states and interactions in the UV, making the resulting IR effective theory appear highly finetuned. The IHP is straightforward to analyze within a theory, but has suspicious regulator dependence, and so may be a fake problem. The EHP is less straightforward to analyze, but has strength of physical intuition. We analyze EHP as a formal paradox, spelling out its premises and reasoning. From this we classify solutions to the EHP in terms of premise violations, and we articulate why some purported solutions to the Hierarchy Problem only partially solve the IHP and leave the EHP unaddressed.</description>

      <title>Particle Masses Spectrum from Harmonic Cascade Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a parameter-free framework, Recognition Science (RS), that predicts the full spectrum of Standard-Model particle masses from first principles. The derived mass formula $m(n,d,s,g) = m_0 \cdot (X_{opt})^{n} \cdot (X_{opt})^{R_{RS}} \cdot E(d,s,g)$ prescribes to each particle a discrete harmonic lattice site $n$ involving only geometric constants: the optimal recognition scale $X_{opt} = \phi/\pi$, a resonance index $R_{RS} = 7/12$, the Planck-derived base mass $m_0$, and an efficiency factor $E(d,s,g)$ that depends on interaction dimensionality $d$, spin $s$ and generation $g$. Simple ratios 7/8, 5/6 and 12/13 link neighboring lattice sites and explain electromagnetic, force-matter and generational splittings, respectively. The mass formula reproduces all measured lepton, quark, meson and baryon masses to better than 0.1% and resolves the long-standing bottom-quark anomaly via a naturally emerging recognition boundary at $n \approx 60.7$. RS also predicts concrete and testable masses for yet-undiscovered states.</description>

      <title>Freeze-In Dark Matter and Leptogenesis: a $\psi'$SM route</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of \emph{freeze-in} dark matter production and baryogenesis via leptogenesis in a $\psi'$SM model, which is an $E_6$ extension of the Standard Model, featuring a residual $U(1)_{\psi'}$ gauge symmetry. This symmetry arises from a linear combination of $U(1)\chi$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$, both of which are subgroups of the $E_6$. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\psi'}$ symmetry governs the dynamics of a singlet fermion, which naturally serves as a freeze-in dark matter candidate. The dark matter mass arises from dimension-five operators, and a discrete symmetry ensures their stability. We show that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic abundance for dark matter masses between a few MeV to a few hundred GeV. Simultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Learning Pole Structures of Hadronic States using Predictive Uncertainty Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\%$ while discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure inference in scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: Despite decades of research, we still lack a detailed quantitative understanding of the way quantum chromodynamics (QCD) generates the spectrum of hadrons. Precise experimental studies of the hadron excitation spectrum and the dynamics of hadrons help to improve models and to test effective theories and lattice QCD simulations. In addition, QCD seems to allow hadrons beyond the three-quark and quark-antiquark configurations of the constituent-quark model. These so-called exotic hadrons contain additional constituent (anti)quarks or excited gluonic fields that contribute to the quantum numbers of the hadron. The COMPASS experiment at CERN is studying the excitation spectrum of light mesons composed of up, down, and strange quarks. The excited mesons are produced via the strong interaction by scattering a 190 GeV/c pion beam off proton or nuclear targets. On heavy nuclear targets, in addition the electromagnetic interaction contributes in the form of quasi-real photon exchange at very low four-momentum transfer squared. COMPASS has performed the most comprehensive analyses to date of isovector resonances decaying into multi-particle final states. In this review, we give a general introduction into scattering theory and the employed partial-wave analysis techniques. We also describe novel methods developed for the high-precision COMPASS data. The COMPASS results are summarized and compared to previous measurements. In addition, we discuss possible signals for exotic mesons and conclude that COMPASS data provide solid evidence for the existence of the manifestly exotic $\pi_1(1600)$, which has quantum numbers forbidden for a quark-model state, and of the $a_1(1420)$, which does not fit into the quark-model spectrum. By isolating the contributions from quasi-real photon exchange, COMPASS has measured the radiative widths of the $a_2(1320)$ and, for the first time, that of the $\pi_2(1670)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Particles Produced from Bubble Collisions in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a new source of gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order phase transitions. The collisions of bubbles of the new phase can efficiently produce particles that couple to the background field undergoing the transition, thereby transferring a significant fraction of the released vacuum energy into a distribution of inhomogeneous and dynamic particle populations that persist long after the bubbles have disappeared. We study the GWs produced by such particle distributions, showing that GWs arise from the quadrupolar anisotropy in the radiation emitted from the bubble collisions, and present a semi-analytical calculation of the two-point correlation function for the associated energy distributions. We find that this new contribution can qualitatively modify the overall GW signal from such phase transitions, creating a distinct shift in the spectral slope at low frequencies that could be observed by future GW experiments. It is therefore important to take this new contribution into account for any transition where the background field has significant self-coupling or couplings to other fields that could lead to efficient particle production at bubble collision.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark-sector effects using gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations are a powerful tool to constrain fundamental physics. This work considers dark matter that carries charge under a dark abelian massive vector field. If such dark matter is bound inside coalescing neutron stars, the presence of the new force will modify the total energy of the binary, and the emission of dark radiation modes will impact the rate of inspiral. At leading order, the dark matter corrections introduce a Yukawa term to the potential energy and a dipole radiation mode. We calculate modifications to the binary inspiral waveform to first post-Newtonian order, incorporate these corrections into a state-of-the-art waveform model for neutron star binaries, and use this model in a Bayesian parameter estimation analysis on real data collected by current, second-generation ground-based detectors. Through this study, we place the first robust constraints on the Yukawa interaction strength and dipole emission parameter. We find that the strongest constraints are obtained from analysis of the GW170817 event, for which the Yukawa interaction strength is constrained to be less than $O(10^{-2})$ and the dipole emission parameter is less than $O(10^{-4})$ at 90% credibility.</description>

Abstract: We present a holomorphic framework in which gravity, gauge interactions, and their couplings to charges and currents emerge from a single geometric action on a four-complex-dimensional manifold. The Hermitian metric yields on the real slice $y^\mu = 0$, a real symmetric metric $g_{(\mu \nu)}$ giving the vacuum Einstein equations, and an antisymmetric part $g_{[\mu \nu]}$ that reproduces Maxwell's equations with sources. A single holomorphic gauge connection for $G_{\text{GUT}}$, such as $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$, encodes all gauge sectors; its Bianchi identities give homogeneous Yang--Mills equations, and variation imposes $\nabla_\mu F^{\mu \nu}_A = J^\nu_A$. Chiral fermions arise from a holomorphic Dirac Lagrangian and couple minimally to all gauge fields, reproducing the Standard Model spectrum. Anomaly cancellation follows from holomorphic gauge invariance. A holomorphic adjoint Higgs breaks $G_{\text{GUT}} \rightarrow SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ with unified coupling, and a second Higgs breaks electroweak symmetry, generating $W^\pm$, $Z$, and fermion masses. Below the unification scale, couplings run by standard renormalization-group flow. This construction unifies Einstein gravity, Yang--Mills theory, electromagnetism, and chiral fermions into a single classical geometric framework, and admits quantization via a holomorphic path integral that reproduces standard Feynman rules.</description>
