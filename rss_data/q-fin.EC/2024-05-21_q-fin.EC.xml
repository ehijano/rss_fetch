      <title>Modelo de la inflaci\'on en Costa Rica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12240</link>

Abstract: The stability of the inflation rate is a necessary condition for the proper functioning of any capitalist economy. In an economic environment with volatile inflation, the growth of the economy and its distribution among the agents of society is compromised. For this reason, and because in Costa Rica, as in most capitalist nations, the monetary authority is in charge of maintaining price stability, it is necessary to have models capable of predicting the behavior of inflation. on in the country. Along these lines, this work aims to compare two of the main types of basic predictive models found in the literature: univariate autoregressive models, exemplified by ARIMA models, and multivariate models formulated based on the theory. economics, like the Phillips curve.</description>

      <title>A 22 percent increase in the German minimum wage: nothing crazy!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first empirical evidence on the 22 percent increase in the German minimum wage, implemented in 2022, raising it from Euro 9.82 to 10.45 in July and to Euro 12 in October. Leveraging the German Earnings Survey, a large and novel data source comprising around 8 million employee-level observations reported by employers each month, we apply a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach to analyze the policy's impact on hourly wages, monthly earnings, employment, and working hours. Our findings reveal significant positive effects on wages, affirming the policy's intended benefits for low-wage workers. Interestingly, we identify a negative effect on working hours, mainly driven by minijobbers. The hours effect results in an implied labor demand elasticity w.r.t. the employment volume of -0.17 which only partially offsets the monthly wage gains. We neither observe a negative effect on the individual's employment retention nor the regional employment levels.</description>

      <title>Consumer lying in online reviews: recent evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence of lying by some consumers in their online posts of experiences with businesses is problematic, and taints the global pool of information that is used for decision making by people that assume they are true accounts of experiences. This study is based on data from my dissertation about fake online Google reviews of restaurants (Berry, 2024), and leverages an instrument that quantifies the trust of people. The findings are based on a sample of n=351, and provide a general proxy for lying in online reviews, and sketch out the characteristics of a typical person that has the propensity to be untruthful. A predictive model of posting untrue online reviews is constructed. The findings have wider implications for the study and monitoring of deceptive behavior, including the propagation of misinformation, and a means of quantifying the potential for antisocial behavior as measured by the trust of people instrument in Berry (2024). Directions for future research and limitations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Ponzi Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many active funds hold concentrated portfolios. Flow-driven trading in these securities causes price pressure, which pushes up the funds' existing positions resulting in realized returns. We decompose fund returns into a price pressure (self-inflated) and a fundamental component and show that when allocating capital across funds, investors are unable to identify whether realized returns are self-inflated or fundamental. Because investors chase self-inflated fund returns at a high frequency, even short-lived impact meaningfully affects fund flows at longer time scales. The combination of price impact and return chasing causes an endogenous feedback loop and a reallocation of wealth to early fund investors, which unravels once the price pressure reverts. We find that flows chasing self-inflated returns predict bubbles in ETFs and their subsequent crashes, and lead to a daily wealth reallocation of 500 Million from ETFs alone. We provide a simple regulatory reporting measure -- fund illiquidity -- which captures a fund's potential for self-inflated returns.</description>

      <title>The Devil is in the Details: Heterogeneous Effects of the German Minimum Wage on Working Hours and Minijobs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2015, Germany introduced a national minimum wage. While the literature agrees on at most limited negative effects on the overall employment level, we go into detail and analyze the impact on the working hours dimension and on the subset of minijobs. Using data from the German Structure of Earnings Survey in 2010, 2014, and 2018, we find empirical evidence that the minimum wage significantly reduces inequality in hourly and monthly wages. While various theoretical mechanisms suggest a reduction in working hours, these remain unchanged on average. However, minijobbers experience a notable reduction in working hours which can be linked to the specific institutional framework. Regarding employment, the results show no effects for regular jobs, but there is a noteworthy decline in minijobs, driven by transitions to regular employment and non-employment. The transitions in non-employment imply a wage elasticity of employment of -0.1 for minijobs. Our findings highlight that the institutional setting leads to heterogeneous effects of the minimum wage.</description>
