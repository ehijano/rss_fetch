      <title>Harmonizing Community Science Datasets to Model Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Birds in the Subantarctic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community science observational datasets are useful in epidemiology and ecology for modeling species distributions, but the heterogeneous nature of the data presents significant challenges for standardization, data quality assurance and control, and workflow management. In this paper, we present a data workflow for cleaning and harmonizing multiple community science datasets, which we implement in a case study using eBird, iNaturalist, GBIF, and other datasets to model the impact of highly pathogenic avian influenza in populations of birds in the subantarctic. We predict population sizes for several species where the demographics are not known, and we present novel estimates for potential mortality rates from HPAI for those species, based on a novel aggregated dataset of mortality rates in the subantarctic.</description>

      <title>Joint economic and epidemiological modelling of alternative pandemic response strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an emerging pandemic, policymakers need to make important decisions with limited information, for example choosing between a mitigation, suppression or elimination strategy. These strategies may require trade-offs to be made between the health impact of the pandemic and the economic costs of the interventions introduced in response. Mathematical models are a useful tool that can help understand the consequences of alternative policy options on the future dynamics and impact of the epidemic. Most models have focused on direct health impacts, neglecting the economic costs of control measures. Here, we introduce a model framework that captures both health and economic costs. We use this framework to compare the expected aggregate costs of mitigation, suppression and elimination strategies, across a range of different epidemiological and economic parameters. We find that for diseases with low severity, mitigation tends to be the most cost-effective option. For more severe diseases, suppression tends to be most cost effective if the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is relatively low, while elimination tends to be more cost-effective if $R_0$ is high. We use the example of New Zealand's elimination response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 to anchor our framework to a real-world case study. We find that parameter estimates for Covid-19 in New Zealand put it close to or above the threshold at which elimination becomes more cost-effective than mitigation. We conclude that our proposed framework holds promise as a decision-support tool for future pandemic threats, although further work is needed to account for population heterogeneity and other factors relevant to decision-making.</description>

      <title>Flow-Based Modelling of Population Dynamics with Consecutive Continuous Mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuous mathematical model of population dynamics that describes the sequential emergence of new genotypes under limited resources. The framework models genotype density as a nonlinear flow in mutation space, combining transport driven by a time-dependent mutation rate with logistic growth and nonlocal competition. For the advection-reaction regime without reverse mutations, we derive analytical solutions using the method of characteristics and obtain explicit expressions for time-varying carrying capacities and mutation velocities. We analyze how decaying and accelerating mutation rates shape the saturation and propagation of population fronts through level-set geometry. When reverse mutations are included, the system becomes a quasilinear parabolic equation with diffusion in genotype space; numerical experiments show that backward mutation flows stabilize the dynamics and smooth the evolving fronts. The proposed model generalizes classical quasispecies and Crow-Kimura formulations by incorporating logistic regulation, variable mutation rates, and reversible transitions, offering a unified approach to evolutionary processes relevant to virology, bacterial adaptation, and tumor progression.</description>

      <title>Sleep effects on brain, cognition, and mental health during adolescence are mediated by the glymphatic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Adolescence is a critical period of brain maturation and heightened vulnerability to cognitive and mental health disorders. Sleep plays a vital role in neurodevelopment, yet the mechanisms linking insufficient sleep to adverse brain and behavioral outcomes remain unclear. The glymphatic system (GS), a brain-wide clearance pathway, may provide a key mechanistic link. Methods: Participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n =6,800; age ~ 11 years) were categorized into sleep-sufficient (&gt;=9 h/night) and sleep-insufficient (&lt;9 h/night) groups. Linear models tested associations among sleep, PVS burden, brain volumes, and behavioral outcomes. Mediation analyses evaluated whether PVS burden explained sleep-related effects. Results: Adolescents with insufficient sleep exhibited significantly greater PVS burden, reduced cortical, subcortical, and white matter volumes, poorer cognitive performance across multiple domains (largest effect in crystallized intelligence), and elevated psychopathology (largest effect in general problems). Sleep duration and quality were strongly associated with PVS burden. Mediation analyses revealed that PVS burden partially mediated sleep effects on cognition and mental health, with indirect proportions up to 10.9%. Sequential models suggested a pathway from sleep -&gt; PVS -&gt; brain volume -&gt; behavior as the most plausible route. Conclusions: Insufficient sleep during adolescence is linked to glymphatic dysfunction, reflected by increased PVS burden, which partially accounts for adverse effects on brain structure, cognition, and mental health. These findings highlight the GS as a potential mechanistic pathway and imaging biomarker, underscoring the importance of promoting adequate sleep to support neurodevelopment and mental health.</description>

      <title>Resource and population dynamics in an agent-environment interaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In any ecosystem, the conditions of the environment and the characteristics of the species that inhabit it are entangled, co-evolving in space and time. We introduce a model that couples active agents with a dynamic environment, interpreted as a nutrient source. Agents are persistent random walkers that gather food from the environment and store it in an inner energy depot. This energy is used for self-propulsion, metabolic expenses, and reproduction. The environment is a two-dimensional surface divided into patches, each of them producing food. Thus, population size and resource distribution become emergent properties of the system. Combining simulations and analytical framework to analyze limiting cases, we show that the system exhibits distinct phases separating quasi-static and highly motile regimes. We observe that, in general, population sizes are inversely proportional to the average energy per agent. Furthermore, we find that, counter-intuitively, reduced access to resources or increased metabolic expenditure can lead to a larger population size. The proposed theoretical framework provides a link between active matter and movement ecology, allowing to investigate short vs long-term strategies to resource exploitation and rationing, as well as sedentary vs wandering strategy. The introduced approach may serve as a tool to describe real-world ecological systems and to test environmental strategies to prevent species extinction.</description>

      <title>Dynamical compatibility for finite and infinite population models used in genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite and infinite population models are frequently used in population dynamics. However, their interrelationship is rarely discussed. In this work, we examine the limits of large populations of the Moran process (a finite-population birth-death process) and the replicator equation (an ordinary differential equation) as paradigmatic examples of finite and infinite population models, respectively, both of which are extensively used in population genetics. Except for certain degenerate cases, we completely characterize when these models exhibit similar dynamics, i.e., when there is a one-to-one relation between the stable attractors of the replicator equations and the metastable states of the Moran process. To achieve this goal, we first show that the asymptotic expression for the fixation probability in the Moran process, when the population size is large and individual interaction is almost arbitrary (including cases modeled through $d$-player game theory), is a convex combination of the asymptotic approximations obtained in the constant fitness case or 2-player game theory. We discuss several examples and the inverse problem, i.e., how to derive a Moran process that is compatible with a given replicator dynamics. In particular, we prove that modeling a Moran process with an inner metastable state may require the use of $d$-player game theory with possibly large $d$ values, depending on the precise location of the inner equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of \textit{Culex} population abundance and the impact of vector control interventions in a patchy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent mosquito-borne outbreaks have revealed vulnerabilities in our abatement programmes, raising concerns about how abatement-districts should choose optimal future control strategies. Spatial dissemination of vector-borne disease is strongly shaped by the movement of both hosts and mosquitoes, creating substantial overlap between vector activity and pathogen spread. We developed a mathematical model for Culex mosquito dynamics in a patchy landscape, integrating entomological observations, weather-driven factors, and the vector control practices of the Northwest Mosquito Abatement District (NWMAD) in Cook County, Illinois. By coupling a temperature-driven multi-patch ODE model with NWMAD's adulticide and larvicide interventions, we investigated how spatial heterogeneity and control timing influence mosquito abundance. We also evaluated how mosquito dispersal modifies intervention effectiveness by comparing single-patch and two-patch model outcomes. Our results showed that models ignoring spatial connectivity can substantially overestimate the impact of interventions or misidentify the thresholds of vector persistence. Through numerical simulations, we analysed continuous and pulsatile control approaches under varying spatial and temporal configurations. These findings provide insight into optimal strategies for managing Culex populations and mitigating mosquito-borne disease risk in weather-driven, spatially connected environments across Cook County, Illinois.</description>

      <title>Frequency Locking to Environmental Forcing Suppresses Oscillatory Extinction in Phage-Bacteria Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteriophage-bacteria interactions are central to microbial ecology, influencing evolution, biogeochemical cycles, and pathogen behavior. Most theoretical models assume static environments and passive bacterial hosts, neglecting the joint effects of bacterial traits and environmental fluctuations on coexistence dynamics. This limitation hinders the prediction of microbial persistence in dynamic ecosystems such as soils and oceans.Using a minimal ordinary differential equation framework, we show that the bacterial growth rate and the phage adsorption rate collectively determine three possible ecological outcomes: phage extinction, stable coexistence, or oscillation-induced extinction. Specifically, we demonstrate that environmental fluctuations can suppress destructive oscillations through resonance, promoting coexistence where static models otherwise predict collapse. Counterintuitively, we find that lower bacterial growth rates are helpful in enhancing survival under high infection pressure, elucidating the observed post-infection growth reduction.Our studies reframe bacterial hosts as active builders of ecological dynamics and environmental variation as a potential stabilizing force. Our findings thus bridge a key theory-experiment gap and provide a foundational framework for predicting microbial responses to environmental stress, which might have potential implications for phage therapy, microbiome management, and climate-impacted community resilience.</description>

      <title>Assessing the potential impact of environmental land management schemes on emergent infection disease risks</title>

Abstract: Financial incentives encourage the plantation of new woodland to increase habitat, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, as a contribution to meeting climate change and biodiversity conservation targets. Whilst these are largely positive effects, it is worth considering that this expansion of woodland can lead to increased presence of wildlife species in proximity to agricultural holdings that may pose an enhanced risk of disease transmission between wildlife and livestock. Wildlife and the provision of a reservoir for infectious disease is particularly important in the transmission dynamics of bovine tuberculosis, the case studied here.
  In this paper we develop an economic model for predicting changes in land use resulting from subsidies for woodland planting. We use this to assess the consequent impact on wild deer populations in the newly created woodland areas, and thus the emergent infectious disease risk arising from the proximity of new and existing wild deer populations and existing cattle holdings.
  We consider an area in the South-West of Scotland, having existing woodland, deer populations, and extensive and diverse cattle farm holdings. In this area we find that, with a varying level of subsidy and plausible new woodland creation scenarios, the contact risk between areas of wild deer and cattle increases between 26% and 35% over the risk present with a zero subsidy.
  This provides a foundation for extending to larger regions and for examining potential risk mitigation strategies, for example the targeting of subsidy in low disease risk areas, or provisioning for buffer zones between woodland and agricultural holdings.</description>

      <title>Life as a Categorical Information-Handling System: An Evolutionary Information-Theoretic Model of the Holobiont</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems can be understood as organized entities that capture, transform, and reproduce information. Classical gene-centered models explain adaptation through frequency changes driven by differential fitness, yet they often overlook the higher-order organization and causal closure that characterize living systems. Here we revisit several evolutionary frameworks, from the replicator equation to group selection and holobiont dynamics, and show that evolutionary change in population frequencies can be expressed as a Jeffreys divergence. Building on this foundation, we introduce a categorical model of Information Handlers (IH), entities capable of self-maintenance, mutation, and combination. This abstract architecture illustrates the usefulness of category theory for framing evolutionary processes that range from very simple to highly complex. The same categorical scheme can represent basic allele-frequency change as well as more elaborate scenarios involving reproductive interactions, symbiosis, and other organizational layers. A key feature of the framework is that different levels of evolutionary change can be summarized through a measure that quantifies the information generated, thereby distinguishing diverse types of evolutionary transformation such as individual and sexual selection, mate choice, or even holobiont selection. Finally, we show that the informational partition associated with host-microbiome pairings in holobionts generalizes the information-theoretic structure previously developed for non-random mating, revealing a common underlying architecture across biological scales.</description>
