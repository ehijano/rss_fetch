      <title>Semiclassical corrections to a regularized Schwarzschild metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A regular form of the Schwarzschild geometry is proposed. It is more suitable for application in microphysics because the source mass comes out both as a Schwarzschild radius and the Compton wavelength of the mass $m$. The Komar energy equals $mc^{2}$ in the classical situation ($\hbar = 0$).</description>

      <title>Rapid parameter estimation for pulsar-timing-array datasets with variational inference and normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the gravitational-wave analysis of pulsar-timing-array datasets, parameter estimation is usually performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to explore posterior probability densities. We introduce an alternative procedure that relies instead on stochastic gradient-descent Bayesian variational inference, whereby we obtain the weights of a neural-network approximation of the posterior by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the approximation from the exact posterior. This technique is distinct from simulation-based inference with normalizing flows, since we train the network for a single dataset, rather than the population of all possible datasets, and we require the computation of the data likelihood and its gradient. Unlike Markov Chain methods, our technique can transparently exploit highly parallel computing platforms. This makes it extremely fast on modern graphical processing units, where it can analyze the NANOGrav 15-yr dataset in few tens of minutes, depending on the probabilistic model, as opposed to hours or days with the analysis codes used until now. We expect that this speed will unlock new kinds of astrophysical and cosmological studies of pulsar-timing-array datasets. Furthermore, variational inference would be viable in other contexts of gravitational-wave data analysis as long as differentiable and parallelizable likelihoods are available.</description>

      <title>A Review of Gravitational Memory and BMS Frame Fixing in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational memory effects and the BMS freedoms exhibited at future null infinity have recently been resolved and utilized in numerical relativity simulations. With this, gravitational wave models and our understanding of the fundamental nature of general relativity have been vastly improved. In this paper, we review the history and intuition behind memory effects and BMS symmetries, how they manifest in gravitational waves, and how controlling the infinite number of BMS freedoms of numerical relativity simulations can crucially improve the waveform models that are used by gravitational wave detectors. We reiterate the fact that, with memory effects and BMS symmetries, not only can these next-generation numerical waveforms be used to observe never-before-seen physics, but they can also be used to test GR and learn new astrophysical information about our universe.</description>

      <title>Black hole horizons must be veiled by photon spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizons and bound photon orbits are defining features of black holes that translate into key features of black hole images. We present a purely geometric proof that spherically symmetric, isolated objects with horizons in gravity theories with null-geodesic propagation of light must display bound photon orbits forming a photon sphere. Identifying the key elements of the proof, we articulate a simpler argument that carries over to more general situations with modified light propagation and implies the existence of equatorial spherical photon orbits in axisymmetric spacetimes with reflection symmetry. We conclude that the \emph{non-}observation of photon rings with very-large-baseline interferometry would be a very strong indication against a horizon, irrespective of whether or not the image shows a central brightness depression.</description>

      <title>Exact analytic photon escape cones and silhouettes for extremal Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit exact analytic, fully explicit, photon escape cones and related silhouettes ("shadows") at arbitrary distance from the extremal Kerr black hole. In contrast to the situation for non-extremal Kerr, where one typically has to resort to either numerical and/or perturbative investigations, the situation for extremal Kerr is amenable to direct analytic investigation.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution in Canonical Quantum Gravity is Trivial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wheeler-DeWitt equation does not describe any explicit time evolution of the wave function, and somehow related to this issue, there is no natural way of defining an invariant inner product that provides a viable probability interpretation. We show that both of these difficulties are solved in a covariant canonical formulation of general relativity where the configuration space is extended by introducing the embedding coordinates as dynamical variables. The formalism describes the evolution of the wave function from one spacelike slice to another, but as in the case of spatial diffeomorphisms this is simply implemented by a coordinate change in the wave function. We demonstrate how the time equation disappears after gauge fixing that removes the embedding coordinates. These findings indicate that the time evolution is trivial in a background independent formulation of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Constant-roll inflation with a complex scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider inflation with a constant rate of rolling in which a complex scalar field plays the role of inflaton during the inflationary epoch. We implement the inflationary analysis for an accredited angular speed $\dot{\theta}$ which satisfies our dynamical equations. Scalar and tensorial perturbations generated in the framework of constant roll inflation with a complex field are studied. In this respect, we find analytically solutions to the gauge invariant fluctuations, with which an expression for the scalar power spectrum together with its scalar index spectral in this scenario were found. By comparing the obtained results with the observations coming from the cosmic microwave background anisotropies, the constraints on the parameters space of the model and also its predictions are analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Past instability of FLRW solutions of the Einstein-Euler-scalar field equations for linear equations of state $p=K\rho$ with $0 \leq K&lt;1/3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using numerical methods, we examine, under a Gowdy symmetry assumption, the dynamics of nonlinearly perturbed FLRW fluid solutions of the Einstein-Euler-scalar field equations in the contracting direction for linear equations of state $p = K\rho$ and sound speeds $0\leq K&lt;1/3$. This article builds upon the numerical work from \cite{BMO:2023} in which perturbations of FLRW solutions to the Einstein-Euler equations with positive cosmological constant in the expanding time direction were studied. The numerical results presented here confirm that the instabilities observed in \cite{BMO:2023,MarshallOliynyk:2022} for $1/3&lt;K&lt;1$, first conjectured to occur in the expanding direction by Rendall in \cite{Rendall:2004}, are also present in the contracting direction over the complementary parameter range $0\leq K&lt;1/3$. Our numerical solutions show that the fractional density gradient of the nonlinear perturbations develop steep gradients near a finite number of spatial points and become unbounded towards the big bang. This behaviour, and in particular the characteristic profile of the fractional density gradient near the big bang, is strikingly similar to what was observed in the expanding direction near timelike infinity in the article \cite{BMO:2023}.</description>

      <title>A regular center instead of a black bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widely discussed ``black-bounce'' mechanism of removing a singularity at $r=0$ in a spherically symmetric space-time, proposed by Simpson and Visser, consists in removing the point $r=0$ and its close neighborhood, resulting in emergence of a regular minimum of the spherical radius that can be a wormhole throat or a regular bounce. Instead, it has been recently proposed to make $r=0$ a regular center by properly modifying the metric, still preserving its form in regions far from $r=0$. Different algorithms of such modifications have been formulated for a few classes of singularities. The previous paper considered space-times whose Ricci tensor satisfies the condition $R^t_t =R^r_r$, and regular modifications were obtained for the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om metrics, and two examples of solutions with magnetic fields obeying nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The present paper considers regular modifications of more general space-times, and as examples, modifications with a regular center have been obtained for the Fisher (also known as JNW) solution with a naked singularity and a family of dilatonic black holes. Possible field sources of the new regular metrics are considered in the framework of general relativity (GR), using the fact that any static, spherically symmetric metric with a combined source involving NED and a scalar field with some self-interaction potential. This scalar field is, in general, not required to be of phantom nature (unlike the sources for black bounces), but in the examples discussed here, the possible scalar sources are phantom in a close neighborhood of $r=0$ and are canonical outside it.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole enclosed by a cavity can be studied in terms of the free energy landscape formalism. The generalized free energy for the black hole enclosed by a cavity in the canonical ensemble is derived by using the York's approach, where the temperature on the cavity and the charges inside the cavity are kept as the fixed parameters. By quantifying the corresponding free energy landscape, we obtain the phase diagrams for the black hole in cavity, which reveal a Hawking-Page type transition for the uncharged black hole and a Van der Waals type transition for the charged black hole. We further assume that the dynamics of black hole state switching is mutually determined by the gradient force and the stochastic force arising from the free energy landscape and the thermal noises respectively. We then derive a recurrence relation for the $n$-momentum of the first passage time distribution function, which enables the calculation of the kinetic times characterized by the mean first passage time and its relative fluctuation. Our analysis illustrates that the kinetics of black hole state switching is determined by the ensemble temperature and the barrier height on the free energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions in teleparallel F(T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate static spherically symmetric teleparallel F(T) gravity containing a perfect isotropic fluid. We first write the field equations and proceed to find new teleparallel F(T) solutions for perfect isotropic and linear fluids. By using a power-law ansatz for the coframe components, we find several classes of new non-trivial teleparallel F(T) solutions. We also find a new class of teleparallel F(T) solutions for a matter dust fluid. After we solve the field equations for a non-linear perfect fluid. Once again, there are several new exact teleparallel F(T) solutions and also some approximated teleparallel F(T) solutions. All these classes of new solutions may be relevant for future cosmological and astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse in Higher-Dimensional Rastall Gravity with and without Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spherically symmetric homogeneous perfect fluid undergoing a gravitational collapse to singularity in the framework of higher-dimensional Rastall gravity in the cases of vanishing and nonvanishing cosmological constants. The possible final states of the collapse in any finite dimension are black hole and naked singularity, hence violating the cosmic censorship conjecture, but the naked singularity formation becomes less favored when the dimension is increased, such that the conjecture is fully restored in the limit of very high dimensions. We find that there are two physically distinct solutions for the collapse evolution in the case of nonzero cosmological constant: trigonometric and exponential solutions. The effective energy density of the fluid is decreasing (increasing) in the former (latter) when the magnitude of the cosmological constant is increased, which implies that the former undergoes a slower collapse than the latter. Furthermore, we find that a temporary trapped surface is possible to emerge in the case of trigonometric solution in the naked singularity region only. Therefore, faraway observers with observational time shorter than the collapse duration may conclude that a black hole is formed, although the collapse will eventually lead to a naked singularity formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to investigate signatures of a quantum gravity phase in the primordial state of cosmological perturbations. We formulate and study a quantum model of a perturbed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe beyond the conventional Born-Oppenheimer factorization, that is, without restricting the wave function of the universe to the product of the background and perturbation wave functions. We show that the quantum dynamics generically does not preserve the product form of the universe's wave function, that spontaneously evolves into a more general entangled state. Upon expanding this state in a suitable basis of background wave functions and setting Gaussian initial conditions for the perturbations, we numerically find that each of these wave functions becomes associated to a non-Gaussian state of an inhomogeneous perturbation.</description>

      <title>Orbital Stability Study of the Taiji Space Gravitational Wave Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detection is extremely sensitive to disturbances. The Keplerian configuration cannot accurately reflect the variations in spacecraft configuration. Planetary gravitational disturbances are one of the main sources. Numerical simulation is an effective method to investigate the impact of perturbation on spacecraft orbits. This study shows that, in the context of the Taiji project, Earth's gravity is an essential factor in the change in heliocentric formation configuration, contributing to the relative acceleration between spacecrafts in the order of $\mathcal O(10^{-6})\,{\rm m\cdot s^{-2}}$. Considering 00:00:00 on 27 October 2032 as the initial orbiting moment, under the influence of Earth's gravitational perturbation, the maximum relative change in armlengths and variation rates of armlengths for Taiji is $1.6\times 10^{5}\,{\rm km}$, $32\,{\rm m\cdot s^{-1}}$, respectively, compared with the unperturbed Keplerian orbit. Additionally, by considering the gravitational perturbations of Venus and Jupiter, the armlength and relative velocity for Taiji are reduced by $16.01\%$ and $17.45\%$, respectively, compared with when only considering that of Earth. The maximum amplitude of the formation motion indicator changes with the orbit entry time. Results show that the relative velocity increase between the spacecrafts is minimal when the initial orbital moment occurs in July. Moreover, the numerical simulation results are inconsistent when using different ephemerides. The differences between ephemerides DE440 and DE430 are smaller than those between DE440 and DE421.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin Interactions in General Relativity versus Linearized Massive Gravity: $N$-body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulated spin-spin interactions of $N$-bodies in linearized General Relativity (GR) and linearized Massive Gravity of the Fierz-Pauli type (mGR). It was noted earlier that there is a discrete difference between the spin-spin interaction potential in GR and mGR for a $2$-body system, akin to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in the static Newton's potential. Specifically, at large distances, GR favors anti-parallel spin orientation with total spin pointing along the interaction axis, while mGR favors parallel spin orientation with total spin perpendicular to the axis between the sources. For an $N$-body system, a simulation in mGR hitherto has not been done and one would like to know the total spin of the system in both theories. Here we remedy this. In the simulations of GR, we observed that the total spin tends to decrease from a random initial configuration, while for mGR with a large distance, the total spin increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New one parameter family of exact solutions in General Relativity with a scalar field is found. The metric is of Liouville type which admits complete separation of variables in the geodesic Hamilton--Jacobi equation. This solution exists for the exponential potential for a scalar field and is invariant with respect to global Lorentz transformations. It describes, in particular, a black hole formation as well as a naked singularity. Solutions corresponding to the naked singularity describe accelerating expansion of the homogeneous and isotropic Universe, and can be smoothly continued along geodesics to infinite past without Big Bang.</description>

      <title>On the radiation field of a linearly accelerated charged particle in Born-Infeld theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric potential and the electromagnetic field for a linearly accelerated Born-Infeld charged particle are obtained in an inertial frame by a method that can, in principle, be applied to any electromagnetic theory. The method is based on (i) the fact that the metric near the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is equivalent to that of Rindler spacetime, and (ii) a theorem that guarantees that the electrostatic potential for a given nonlinear theory in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime is entirely specified by the Maxwellian electrostatic potential in the same background. Using analytical and numerical methods, the features of the radiation field and the radiation-reaction for such an accelerated particle are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Predicting Binary Neutron Star Postmerger Spectra Using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves in the postmerger phase of binary neutron star mergers may become detectable with planned upgrades of existing gravitational-wave detectors or with more sensitive next-generation detectors. The construction of template banks for the postmerger phase can facilitate signal detection and parameter estimation. Here, we investigate the performance of an artificial neural network in predicting simulation-based waveforms in the frequency domain (restricted to the magnitude of the frequency spectrum and to equal-mass models) that depend on three parameters that can be inferred through observations, neutron star mass, tidal deformability, and the gradient of radius versus mass. Compared to a baseline study using multiple linear regression, we find that the artificial neural network can predict waveforms with higher accuracy and more consistent performance in a cross-validation study. We also demonstrate, through a recalibration procedure, that future reduction of uncertainties in empirical relations that are used in our hierarchical scheme will result in more accurate predicted postmerger spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of charged scalar bosons in a Bonnor-Melvin-$\Lambda$ universe is considered. In this study, the behavior of charged scalar bosons is explored within the framework of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) formalism. Adopting a conical approximation ($\Lambda\ll 1$), we are considered two scenarios for the vector potential: a linear and quadratic vector potentials. In particular, the effects of this background in the equation of motion, phase shift, $S$-matrix, energy spectrum and DKP spinor are analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Robust inference of gravitational wave source parameters in the presence of noise transients using normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection is of paramount importance in fundamental physics and GW astronomy, yet it presents formidable challenges. One significant challenge is the removal of noise transient artifacts known as ``glitches," which greatly impact the search and identification of GWs. Recent research has achieved remarkable results in data denoising, often using effective modeling methods to remove glitches. However, for glitches from uncertain or unknown sources, current methods cannot completely eliminate them from the GW signal. In this work, we leverage the inherent robustness of machine learning to obtain reliable posterior parameter distributions directly from GW data contaminated by glitches. Our network model provides reasonable and rapid parameter inference even in the presence of glitches, without needing to remove them. We also investigate various factors affecting the rationality of parameter inference in our normalizing flow network, including glitch and GW parameters. The results demonstrate that the normalizing flow can reasonably infer the source parameters of GWs even with unknown contamination. We find that the nature of the glitch itself is the only factor that can affect the rationality of the inferred results. With improvements to our model, we anticipate accelerating the localization of electromagnetic counterparts and providing priors for more accurate deglitching, thereby speeding up subsequent data processing procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an idea put forward many years ago by Zeldovich and Novikov concerning the existence of compact objects endowed with arbitrarily small mass. The energy-density of such objects, which we call ``Ghost stars'', is negative in some regions of the fluid distribution, producing a vanishing total mass. Thus, the interior is matched on the boundary surface to Minkowski space-time. Some exact analytical solutions are exhibited and their properties are analyzed. Observational data that could confirm or dismiss the existence of this kind of stellar object is commented.</description>

      <title>A dissipative extension to ideal hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formulation of special relativistic, dissipative hydrodynamics (SRDHD) derived from the well-established M\"uller- Israel-Stewart (MIS) formalism using an expansion in deviations from ideal behaviour. By re-summing the non-ideal terms, our approach extends the Euler equations of motion for an ideal fluid through a series of additional source terms that capture the effects of bulk viscosity, shear viscosity and heat flux. For efficiency these additional terms are built from purely spatial derivatives of the primitive fluid variables. The series expansion is parametrized by the dissipation strength and timescale coefficients, and is therefore rapidly convergent near the ideal limit. We show, using numerical simulations, that our model reproduces the dissipative fluid behaviour of other formulations. As our formulation is designed to avoid the numerical stiffness issues that arise in the traditional MIS formalism for fast relaxation timescales, it is roughly an order of magnitude faster than standard methods near the ideal limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start from the assumption that the theory of gravity can be formulated in terms of 4-dimensional action, and there are only 2 graviton polarization states, as in general relativity. It can be a non-perturbative effective action discussed in the asymptotic safety program or the result of some other UV modification of the general relativity making it a complete theory. From these general grounds, we study the properties of the graviton two-point function on top of cosmological de-Sitter space. We find that the no-ghost requirement formulated for the flat background does not necessarily hold for the de-Sitter space where the graviton two-point function can have an infinite number of complex-conjugate poles. We show that under certain stability conditions, their appearance doesn't contradict any fundamental principle. We discuss their observational consequences for the tensor power spectrum from inflation and for the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Multifield Stochastic Dynamics in GUT Hybrid Inflation and Gravitational Wave Signatures of GUT Higgs Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the hybrid inflation model within the framework of the Grand Unified Theory (GUT), focusing on cases where the waterfall phase transition extends over several e-foldings to dilute monopoles. Considering the stochastic effects of quantum fluctuations, we demonstrate that the waterfall fields (i.e., GUT Higgs) maintain a nonzero vacuum expectation value around the waterfall phase transition. By accurately accounting for the number of degrees of freedom of the GUT Higgs field, we establish that these fluctuations can produce observable gravitational waves without leading to an overproduction of primordial black holes. The amplitude of these gravitational waves is inversely proportional to the degrees of freedom of the waterfall fields, thereby providing a unique method to probe the representation of the GUT Higgs.</description>

      <title>Unearthing the intersections: positivity bounds, weak gravity conjecture, and asymptotic safety landscapes from photon-graviton flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotic safety landscape stemming from ultraviolet-complete photon-graviton flows in a field theoretic setup, and we confront it with the weak gravity conjecture and, for the first time, with positivity bounds. At fourth order in derivatives, we find two gravitational fixed points providing viable ultraviolet completions for the theory. One of them comes with a single relevant direction, which sets the scale of quantum gravity. The corresponding sub-landscape is a single point. The second fixed point yields a richer sub-landscape of effective theories, most of which is described by an approximately straight line in the space of dimensionless Wilson coefficients. We additionally discover that: (i) the two sub-landscapes are continuously connected via a small "candy cane" regime, and the whole asymptotic safety landscape falls onto a plane; this is consistent with earlier findings and could be a universal feature in Asymptotic Safety; (ii) in such a field-theoretic setup, the Euler coupling plays a special role, as it is unconstrained by quantum scale invariance, but can enter off-shell bounds such as entropy-based positivity constraints; (iii) Planck-scale-suppressed violations of both weak gravity and positivity bounds occur across the landscape. The latter result resonates with expectations grounded on effective field theory arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positivity bounds are bounds on the Wilson coefficients of an effective field theory. They hold, if the ultraviolet completion satisfies unitarity, microcausality, locality and Lorentz symmetry; accordingly their violation signals a violation of at least one of these properties of the ultraviolet completion. We explore whether positivity bounds on four-photon-couplings hold, when the ultraviolet completion is an asymptotically safe gravity-photon theory. By working at sixth order in an expansion in the electromagnetic field strength, we discover indications that positivity bounds hold for effective field theories that are UV completed by the asymptotically safe Reuter fixed point. We also perform various tests of the robustness of our result. This amounts to a nontrivial and critical indication of the physical viability of asymptotically safe gravity.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the vacuum of quantum gravity must contain a hierarchical structure of correlations spanning all length scales. These correlated domains (called `vecros') correspond to virtual fluctuations of black hole microstates. Larger fluctuations are suppressed by their larger action, but this suppression is offset by a correspondingly larger phase space of possible configurations. We give an explicit lattice model of these vecro fluctuations, noting how their distribution changes as the gravitational pull of a star becomes stronger. At the threshold of formation of a closed trapped surface, these virtual fluctuations transition into on-shell black hole microstates (fuzzballs). Fuzzballs radiate from their surface like normal bodies, resolving the information paradox. We also argue that any model without vecro-type extended vacuum correlations cannot resolve the paradox.</description>

      <title>Continuum emission from within the plunging region of black hole discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal continuum emission observed from accreting black holes across X-ray bands has the potential to be leveraged as a powerful probe of the mass and spin of the central black hole. The vast majority of existing ``continuum fitting'' models neglect emission sourced at and within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the black hole. Numerical simulations, however, find non-zero emission sourced from these regions. In this work we extend existing techniques by including the emission sourced from within the plunging region, utilising new analytical models which reproduce the properties of numerical accretion simulations. We show that in general the neglected intra-ISCO emission produces a hot-and-small quasi-blackbody component, but can also produce a weak power-law tail for more extreme parameter regions. A similar hot-and-small blackbody component has been added in by hand in an ad-hoc manner to previous analyses of X-ray binary spectra. We show that the X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1820+070 in a soft-state outburst is extremely well described by a full Kerr black hole disc, while conventional models which neglect intra-ISCO emission are unable to reproduce the data. We believe this represents the first robust detection of intra-ISCO emission in the literature, and allows additional constraints to be placed on the MAXI J1820+070 black hole spin which must be low $a_\bullet &lt; 0.5$ to allow a detectable intra-ISCO region. Emission from within the ISCO is the dominant emission component in the MAXI J1820+070 spectrum between $6$ and $10$ keV, highlighting the necessity of including this region. Our continuum fitting model is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy in the effective field theory of general relativity with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A consistency condition of general relativity as an effective field theory in Minkowskian background uniquely fixes the value of the cosmological constant. In two-loop calculations, including the interaction of gravitons with matter fields, it has been shown that this value of the cosmological constant leads to vanishing vacuum energy, under the assumption that the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field is given by the pseudotensor of Landau-Lifshitz's classic textbook. Here, we demonstrate that this result also holds when the self-interaction of a scalar field is taken into account. That is, our two-loop-order calculation suggests that in an effective field theory of metric and scalar fields, one arrives at a consistent theory with massless gravitons if the cosmological constant is fixed from the condition of vanishing vacuum energy. Vice versa, imposing the consistency condition in Minkowskian background leads to a vanishing vacuum energy.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quintessence: curved, steep and stringy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that our universe's current accelerated expansion is explained by a quintessence model with an exponential scalar potential, $V =V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \phi}$, keeping an eye towards $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$ and an open universe, favorable to a string theory realisation and with no cosmological horizon. We work out the full cosmology of the model, including matter, radiation, and optionally negative spatial curvature, for all $\lambda&gt;0$, performing an extensive analysis of the dynamical system and its phase space. The minimal physical requirements of a past epoch of radiation domination and an accelerated expansion today lead to an upper bound $\lambda \lesssim \sqrt{3}$, which is driven slightly up in the presence of observationally allowed spatial curvature. Cosmological solutions start universally in a kination epoch, go through radiation and matter dominated phases and enter an epoch of acceleration, which is only transient for $\lambda&gt;\sqrt{2}$. Field distances traversed between BBN and today are sub-Planckian. We discuss possible string theory origins and phenomenological challenges, such as time variation of fundamental constants. We provide theoretical predictions for the model parameters to be fitted to data, most notably the varying dark energy equation of state parameter, in light of recent results from DES-Y5 and DESI.</description>

      <title>Some 1d (Supersymmetric) Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dimensional reduction by spherical symmetry in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories with gauge groups $SU(2)$ and $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ (de Sitter gravity). We start with pure Chern-Simons theories and show that the reduced theory obtained by employing a spherically symmetric ansatz on the gauge field is similar to a fermionic theory in 1d coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field with a 1-dimensional Chern-Simons kinetic term. Furthermore, we carry out a semiclassical computation that demonstrates that in the large $\kappa$ limit, the path integral of the 3d pure Chern-Simons theory is equivalent to the path integral of the dimensionally reduced theory, which is a 1d QFT. Moreover, we argue that the Wilson loop operators in the large $\kappa$ limit should reduce to some observables of the 1-dimensional theory. This agreement hints at the existence of a duality at the quantum level between the 3d Chern-Simons theory and the 1d reduced theory. We then study Chern-Simons Higgs theories in the Euclidean formalism. We again employ the spherically symmetric ansatz\"e on the fields, and show that at the clasical level, the action of the reduced theory is a theory with some scalar fields $\mathsf{X}_i$ coupled to fermionic fields $\Psi_i$. To get an appropriate reduced action, we define the original theory on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ with the geometry of $\mathbb{R} \times S^2$. With a suitable choice of the potential of the Higgs field, we show that the reduced theory, which is the action that governs the spherically symmetric monopoles in the Chern-Simons Higgs theory, is equivalent to a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. The flux of the Chern-Simons Higgs monopole is shown to be related to the fermionic number operator $F = \overline{\Psi} \Psi$, which in turn is related to the Witten index.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave model for neutron star merger remnants with supervised learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a time-domain model for the gravitational waves emitted by equal-mass binary neutron star merger remnants for a fixed equation of state. We construct a large set of numerical relativity simulations for a single equation of state consistent with current constraints, totaling 157 equal-mass binary neutron star merger configurations. The gravitational-wave model is constructed using the supervised learning method of K-nearest neighbor regression. As a first step toward developing a general model with supervised learning methods that accounts for the dependencies on equation of state and the binary masses of the system, we explore the impact of the size of the dataset on the model. We assess the accuracy of the model for a varied dataset size and number density in total binary mass. Specifically, we consider five training sets of $\{ 20,40, 60, 80, 100\}$ simulations uniformly distributed in total binary mass. We evaluate the resulting models in terms of faithfulness using a test set of 30 additional simulations that are not used during training and which are equidistantly spaced in total binary mass. The models achieve faithfulness with maximum values in the range of $0.980$ to $0.995$. We assess our models simulating signals observed by the three-detector network of Advanced LIGO-Virgo. We find that all models with training sets of size equal to or larger than $40$ achieve an unbiased measurement of the main gravitational-wave frequency. We confirm that our results do not depend qualitatively on the choice of the (fixed) equation of state. We conclude that training sets, with a minimum size of $40$ simulations, or a number density of approximately $11$ simulations per $0.1\,M_\odot$ of total binary mass, suffice for the construction of faithful templates for the post-merger signal for a single equation of state and equal-mass binaries (abbreviated).</description>

      <title>Note on the Taub-NUT Instanton Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a complex coordinate transformation maps the Taub-NUT instanton metric to a Kerr-Schild metric. This metric involves a semi-infinite line defect as a gravitational analog of the Dirac string, much like the original metric. Also, it corresponds to self-dual dyon in electromagnetism through three versions of classical double copy, one of them being a novel nonlocal operator form. The relevance to Newman-Janis algorithm is briefly noted.</description>

Abstract: We identify a set of Hertz potentials for solutions to the vector wave equation on black hole spacetimes. The Hertz potentials yield Lorenz gauge electromagnetic vector potentials that represent physical solutions to the Maxwell equations, satisfy the Teukolsky equation, and are related to the Maxwell scalars by straightforward and separable inversion relations. Our construction, based on the GHP formalism, avoids the need for a mode ansatz and leads to potentials that represent both static and non-static solutions. As an explicit example, we specialise the procedure to mode-decomposed perturbations of Kerr spacetime and in the process make connections with previous results.</description>

      <title>Global exterior stability of the Minkowski space: coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we prove a global gauge-invariant radiation estimates for the perturbations of the $3+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime in the presence of Yang-Mills sources. In particular, we obtain a novel gauge invariant estimate for the Yang-Mills fields coupled to gravity in a double null framework in the Causal complement of a compact set of a Cauchy slice. A consequence of our result is the global exterior stability of the Minkowski space under coupled Yang-Mills perturbations. A special structure present both in the null Bianchi equations and the null Yang-Mills equations is utilized crucially to obtain the dispersive estimates necessary to conclude the global existence property. Direct use of Bel-Robinson and Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor to obtain the energy estimates is avoided in favor of weighted integration by parts taking advantage of the manifestly symmetric hyperbolic characteristics of null Bianchi and null Yang-Mills equations. Our result holds for any compact semi-simple gauge group. This is the first stability result of Minkowski space including a non-linear source.</description>

      <title>Signature of $f\left(R\right)$ gravity via Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi inhomogeneous perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09768v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze inhomogeneous cosmological models in the local Universe, described by the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric and developed using linear perturbation theory on a homogeneous and isotropic Universe background. Focusing on the different evolution of spherical symmetric inhomogeneities, we compare the $\Lambda$LTB model, in which the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is included in the LTB formalism, with inhomogeneous cosmological models based on $f\left(R\right)$ modified gravity theories viewed in the Jordan frame. We solve the system of field equations for both inhomogeneous cosmological models adopting the method of separation of variables: we integrate analytically the radial profiles of local perturbations, while their time evolution requires a numerical approach. The main result of the analysis concerns the different radial profiles of local inhomogeneities due to the presence of a non-minimally coupled scalar field in the Jordan frame of $f\left(R\right)$ gravity. While radial perturbations follow a power-law in the $\Lambda$LTB model, Yukawa-like contributions appear in the $f\left(R\right)$ theory. Interestingly, this latter peculiar behavior of radial profile is not affected by the choice of the $f\left(R\right)$ functional form. The numerical solution of time-dependent perturbations exhibits a non-diverging profile. This work suggests that investigations about local inhomogeneities in the late Universe may allow us to discriminate if the present cosmic acceleration is caused by a cosmological constant term or a modified gravity effect.</description>

      <title>Dark Universe Phenomenology from Yukawa Potential?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the effect of cold dark matter in the cosmological setup can be explained by the coupling between the baryonic matter particles in terms of the long-range force having a graviton mass $m_g$ via the Yukawa gravitational potential. Such a quantum-corrected Yukawa-like gravitational potential is characterized by the coupling parameter $\alpha$, the wavelength parameter $\lambda$, which is related to the graviton mass via $m_g=\hbar/(\lambda c)$, that determines the range of the force and, finally, a Planck length quantity $l_0$ that makes the potential regular at the centre. The corrected Friedmann equations are obtained using Verlinde's entropic force interpretation of gravity based on the holographic scenario and the equipartition law of energy. The parameter $\alpha$ modifies Newton's constant as $G_{\rm eff}\rightarrow G(1+\alpha)$. We argue that dark matter is an apparent effect as no dark matter particle exists in this picture. Furthermore, the dark energy is also related to graviton mass and $\alpha$; in particular, we point out that the cosmological constant can be viewed as a self-interaction effect between gravitons. We further show that there exists a precise correspondence with Verlinde's emergent gravity theory, and due to the long-range force, the theory can be viewed as a non-local gravity theory. To this end, we performed the phase space analyses and estimated $\lambda\simeq 10^3 $[Mpc] and $\alpha \in (0.0385,0.0450)$, respectively. Finally, from these values, for the graviton mass, we get $m_g\simeq 10^{-68}$ kg, and cosmological constant $\Lambda \simeq 10^{-52}\rm m^{-2}$. Further, we argue how this theory reproduces the MOND phenomenology on galactic scales via the acceleration of Milgrom $a_0 \simeq 10^{-10}\rm m/s^2$.</description>

Abstract: We study an inflation model with a flat scalar potential supported by observations and find that slow-roll inflation can emerge after a quasi-cyclic phase of the Universe, where it undergoes repeated expansions and contractions for a finite time period. The initial conditions and the positive spatial curvature required for such nontrivial dynamics align with the quantum creation of the Universe. The key ingredients that trigger inflation are dissipative interactions of the inflaton, which are necessary to reheat the Universe after inflation and thus give us an observational handle on pre-inflationary physics. Our discovery implies that inflation occurs more robustly after the creation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflationary models, especially those with plateau-type potentials, are consistent with the cosmological data, but inflation itself does not resolve the initial singularity. This singularity is resolved, for example, by the idea of the quantum creation of the Universe from nothing such as the tunneling and no-boundary proposals. The simplest one predicts a closed Universe. Motivated by these facts, we investigate the classical dynamics of a closed universe with a plateau-type potential. Depending on the initial inflaton field value, the universe can undergo a variety of events: an immediate big crunch, a bounce or cyclic phase, and inflation. Although the non-inflationary solutions may appear irrelevant to our Universe, they can be turned into single or multiple bounces followed by inflation, taking into account the interactions necessary for the reheating of the Universe after inflation. Thus, the dissipative mechanism in our setup explains both the graceful entry to and exit from inflation and gives us an indirect observational handle on the Universe just after creation. We also comment on the implications of these solutions for probabilistic interpretations of the wave function of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: We present applications of statistical data analysis methods from both bi- and multivariate statistics to find suitable sets of neutron star features that can be leveraged for accurate and EoS independent -- or universal -- relations. To this end, we investigate the ability of various correlation measures such as Distance Correlation and Mutual Information in identifying universally related pairs of neutron star features. We also evaluate relations produced by methods of multivariate statistics such as Principal Component Analysis to assess their suitability for producing universal relations with multiple independent variables.
  As part of our analyses, we also put forward multiple entirely novel relations, including a multivariate relation for the $f$-mode frequency of neutron stars with a reduced average relative error of $0.010$, compared to an error of $0.015$ of existing, bivariate relations.</description>

Abstract: By assuming simultaneously the unitarity of the Hawking evaporation and the universality of Bekenstein entropy bound as well as the validity of cosmic censorship conjecture, we find that the black hole evaporation rate could evolve from the usual inverse square law in black hole mass into a constant evaporation rate near the end of the Hawking evaporation before quantum gravity could come into play, inferring a slightly longer lifetime for lighter black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the stability of the inner horizon of the quantum-corrected black hole which is proposed in loop quantum gravity as the exterior of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder and Swiss Cheese models. It is shown that the flux and energy density of a test scalar field measured by free-falling observers are both divergent near the Cauchy horizon. By considering the generalized Dray-'t Hooft-Redmond relation which is independent of the field equation, we find that the mass inflation always happens and the scalar curvature and Kretschmann scalar are also divergent on the inner horizon. These suggest that the inner horizon is unstable and will probably turn into a null singularity. The results support the strong cosmic censorship hypothesis. However, this also implies that the quantum corrected model may not be the definitive endpoint as a regular black hole. Besides, it further proposes that it may be challenging to observe the astronomical phenomenon which depends on the existence of the inner horizon of the black hole.</description>

Abstract: We expect the final theory of gravity to have more symmetries than we suspect and our research points in this direction, to start with, standard general coordinate invariance can be extended to complex holomorphic general coordinate transformations This is possible by introducing a non Riemannian Measure of integration (NRMI) and where we avoid the non holomorphic standard $\sqrt{-g}$. measure of integration. Second, although globally signed transformations produce a change of boundary conditions and like global parity and global time reversal are not symmetries of nature, locally signed coordinate transformations where the jacobian changes sign locally but the jacobian approaches one asymptotically should be symmetries of nature, The holomorphic extension can regularize the regions of space time where the jacobian changes sign. Consequences for Quantum Gravity are discussed</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Abelian gauge fields invariant under transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff) in cosmological contexts. We show that in the geometric optics approximation, very much as for Diff invariant theories, the corresponding massless gauge bosons propagate along null geodesics and particle number is conserved. In addition, the polarization vectors are orthogonal to the propagation direction and the physical (transverse projection) polarization is parallel transported along the geodesics. We also consider TDiff invariant Dirac spinors, study the coupling to the gauge fields and analyze the conditions in order to avoid violations of Einstein's Equivalence Principle. The contributions to the energy-momentum tensor of the gauge field are also analyzed. We find that, in general, the breaking of Diff invariance makes the electric and magnetic parts of the vector field to gravitate in a different way. In the sub-Hubble regime we recover the standard radiation-like behaviour of the energy density, however in the super-Hubble regime the behaviour is totally different to the Diff case, thus opening up a wide range of possibilities for cosmological model building. In particular, possible effects on the evolution of large-scale primordial magnetic fields are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barrow proposed that quantum gravity effects might introduce fractal corrections to the area of the event horizon of black holes. The area law gets modified as $S \propto A^{1+\Delta/2}$, with $0\leq\Delta\leq 1$. It was so far unclear whether this assumption could lead to meaningful quantum gravity theories beyond general relativity. In this paper, we argue that this is indeed the case. In particular, assuming $\Delta$ to be a radial function, we show that the Barrow hypothesis, together with the Jacobson's approach can generate non-trivial modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Systematic bias from waveform modeling for binary black hole populations in next-generation gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have increased sensitivity and observing volumes, enabling unprecedented precision in parameter estimation. However, this enhanced precision could also reveal systematic biases arising from waveform modeling, which may impact astrophysical inference. We investigate the extent of these biases over a year-long observing run with $10^5$ simulated binary black hole sources using the linear signal approximation. To establish a conservative estimate, we sample binaries from a smoothed truncated power-law population model and compute systematic parameter biases between the IMRPhenomXAS and IMRPhenomD waveform models. For sources with signal-to-noise ratios above 100, we estimate statistically significant parameter biases in $\sim 3\%-20\%$ of the events, depending on the parameter. We find that the average mismatch between waveform models required to achieve a bias of $\leq 1\sigma$ for $99\%$ of detections with signal-to-noise ratios $\geq 100$ should be $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, or at least one order of magnitude better than current levels of waveform accuracy.</description>

      <title>Analysis of anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the model put forth by Ref. [1], in which it is claimed that "post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has three basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics, and (iii) the spectrum of fluctuations is very different from observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of a Schwarzschild-like black hole in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing effect for the Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetime in the background of a Kalb-Ramond (KR) field proposed in [K. Yang et. al., Phys. Rev. D 108 (2023) 124004]. The solution is characterized by a single extra parameter $l$, which is associated to the Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by the KR field. First, we calculate the exact deflection angle of massive and massless particles for finite distances using elliptic integrals. Then we study this effect in the weak and strong field regimes, discussing the correction of the KR parameter on the coefficients of the expansions in both limits. We also find that increasing $l$ decreases the deflection angle. Furthermore, we use the available data from the Sagittarius $A^{\star}$ object, which is believed to be a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, to calculate relevant observables, such as, the image position, luminosity, and delay time. The values found could be potentially measured in the weak field regime, though for strong fields one would have to wait for the next generation of interferometers.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, not included in the Solar system ephemeris, introduces correlated timing noise for pulsars with the magnitude and frequencies of the reported signal.</description>

      <title>Detecting environmental effects in gravitational waves from binaries perturbed by periodic forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational wave (GW) emission of sources perturbed by periodic dynamical forces which do not cause secular evolution in the orbital elements. We construct a corresponding post-Newtonian waveform model and provide estimates for the detectability of the resulting GW phase perturbations, for both space-based and future ground-based detectors. We validate our results by performing a set of Bayesian parameter recovery experiments with post-Newtonian waveforms. We find that, in stark contrast to the more commonly studied secular dephasing, periodic phase perturbations do not suffer from degeneracies with any of the tested vacuum binary parameters. We discuss the applications of our findings to a range of possible astrophysical scenarios, finding that such periodic perturbations may be detectable for massive black hole binaries embedded in circum-binary discs, extreme mass-ratio inspirals in accretion discs, as well as stellar-mass compact objects perturbed by tidal fields. We argue that modelling conservative sub-orbital dynamics opens up a promising new avenue to detect environmental effects in binary sources of GWs that should be included in state-of-the-art waveform templates.</description>

      <title>Notes on Wormhole Cancellation and Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In AdS/CFT, partition functions of decoupled CFTs living on separate asymptotic boundaries factorize. However, the presence of bulk wormholes connecting different boundaries tends to spoil the factorization of the bulk partition function, which leads to a disagreement between the two sides. In this paper, we present two examples where wormhole contributions cancel each other in bulk partition function calculations, thus the bulk factorization can be realized. The first example is in 2-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where the proposed way of realizing the cancellation resides in the extra complex phases associated with different wormholes. The phases arise due to the degenerate vacua structure. In the example of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, the cancellation can be achieved due to the distribution of the wormhole saddles on a complex plane. The two examples demonstrate a way of realizing bulk partition function factorization by extending the Hilbert space and dressing wormhole saddles with extra phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical radiation fields at next-to-leading order using the methods of scattering amplitudes. The fields of interest to us are sourced when two massive, point-like objects scatter inelastically, and can be computed from one-loop amplitudes. We show that the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes both play important but physically distinct roles in the radiation field. The amplitude's imaginary part directly computes the portion of radiation emitted under the influence of a body's self-field, i.e., through radiation reaction. This aspect of radiation reaction is directly linked to one-loop Compton amplitudes in electrodynamics, Yang-Mills theory and gravity. We also discuss the fascinating interplay between renormalisation, radiation reaction and classical field theory from this perspective.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Unitarity and the Wavefunction of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitarity of time evolution is one of the basic principles constraining physical processes. Its consequences in the perturbative Bunch-Davies wavefunction in cosmology have been formulated in terms of the cosmological optical theorem. In this paper, we re-analyse perturbative unitarity for the Bunch-Davies wavefunction, focusing on: 1) the role of the $i\epsilon$-prescription and its compatibility with the requirement of unitarity; 2) the origin of the different "cutting rules"; 3) the emergence of the flat-space optical theorem from the cosmological one. We take the combinatorial point of view of the cosmological polytopes, which provide a first-principle description for a large class of scalar graphs contributing to the wavefunctional. The requirement of the positivity of the geometry together with the preservation of its orientation determine the $i\epsilon$-prescription. In kinematic space it translates into giving a small negative imaginary part to all the energies, making the wavefunction coefficients well-defined for any value of their real part along the real axis. Unitarity is instead encoded into a non-convex part of the cosmological polytope, which we name optical polytope. The cosmological optical theorem emerges as the equivalence between a specific polytope subdivision of the optical polytope and its triangulations, each of which provides different cutting rules. The flat-space optical theorem instead emerges from the non-convexity of the optical polytope. On the more mathematical side, we provide two definitions of this non-convex geometry, none of them based on the idea of the non-convex geometry as a union of convex ones.</description>

      <title>Violation of the equivalence principle induced by oscillating rest mass and transition frequency, and its detection in atom interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the expected experimental signals produced by freely falling atoms with time oscillating mass and transition frequency. These oscillations could be produced in a variety of models, in particular, models of scalar dark matter (DM) non universally coupled to the standard matter (SM) such as axion-like particles (ALP) and dilatons. Performing complete and rigorous calculations, we show that, on one hand, two different atomic species would accelerate at a different rate, and on the other hand, they would produce a non-zero differential phase shift in atom interferometers (AI). The former would produce observable signals in equivalence principle tests like the recent MICROSCOPE mission, and we provide a corresponding sensitivity estimate, showing that MICROSCOPE can reach beyond the best existing searches in the ALP case. We also compare the expected sensitivity of two future AI experiments, namely the AION-10 gradiometer and an isotope differential AI considered for MAGIS-100, that we will refer to as SPID. We show that the SPID setup would be more sensitive to these dark matter fields compared to the gradiometer one, assuming equivalent experimental parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and First Self-Force Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the 5PM order contributions to the scattering angle and impulse of classical black hole scattering in the conservative sector at first self-force order (1SF) using the worldline quantum field theory formalism. This challenging four-loop computation required the use of advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology implemented on high-performance computing systems. Use of partial fraction identities allowed us to render the complete integrand in a fully planar form. The resulting function space is simpler than expected: in the scattering angle we see only multiple polylogarithms up to weight three, and a total absence of the elliptic integrals that appeared at 4PM order. All checks on our result, both internal - cancellation of dimensional regularization poles, preservation of the on-shell condition - and external - matching the slow-velocity limit with the post-Newtonian (PN) literature up to 5PN order and matching the tail terms to the 4PM loss of energy - are passed.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action having two contributions. The first contribution is proportional to the logarithm of the volume associated to the higher-order network by the metric. In the vacuum this contribution determines the entropy of the geometry. The second contribution is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal resonances in the final seconds of a binary neutron-star inspiral can excite oscillation modes in one or both of the constituents to large amplitudes. Under favorable circumstances, resonant pulsations can overstrain the stellar crust and unleash a torrent of magnetoelastic energy that manifests as a gamma-ray ``precursor flare.'' We show that for realistic, stratified stars rotating with a spin frequency of $\gtrsim30\,$Hz, the fundamental $g$ or its first overtone can also execute a differential rotation in the crust such that a magnetic field of strength $\gtrsim10^{13}\,$G is generated via magnetorotational instabilities. This may help to explain observed precursor rates and their luminosities. Premerger magnetic growth would also provide seed magnetic energy for the postmerger remnant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate new constraints on $f(T)$ gravity using the recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) catalog from the full 5-years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN5YR). The $f(T)$ cosmological models considered are characterised by power law late-time accelerated expansion. Our results show that the combination DESI BAO +$r_d$ CMB Planck suggests a Bayesian preference for late-time $f(T)$ cosmological models over $\Lambda$CDM, obtaining a value of $H_0= 68.3^{+3.0}_{-3.5}$[km/s/Mpc] in agreement with SH0ES collaboration, however, due to a bigger uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Geometric Constraints via Page Curves: Insights from Island Rule and Quantum Focusing Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring the inverse problem tied to the Page curve phenomenon and island paradigm, we investigate the geometric conditions underpinning black hole evaporation where information is preserved and islands manifest, giving rise to the characteristic Page curve. Focusing on a broad class of static black hole metrics in asymptotically Minkowski or (anti-)de Sitter spacetimes, we derive a pivotal constraint on the blacken factor $f(r)$ for which the island exists and reproduce the Page curve. Specifically, we reveal that a sufficient yet not universally necessary criterion -- manifested in the negativity of the second derivative of $f(r)$, i.e. $f^{\prime \prime} (r)&lt;0$, in proximity to the event horizon where $r \sim r_h+ {\cal O} (G_N)$, ensures the emergence of Page curves in a manner transcending specific theoretical models. This pivotal finding, supported by the tenets of the quantum focusing conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Curvature Correction and Its Breakdown to Thermodynamics of Rotating Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adopt the Reall-Santos method to obtain the quadratic curvature corrections to the thermodynamics of Myers-Perry rotating black holes in diverse dimensions. We consider the corrections in canonical and grand canonical ensembles, and also for fixed mass and angular momenta. We find that there exist inevitable divergences for generic rotation parameters so that the perturbative approach breaks down. We present a simple and universal formula to determine where these divergences could arise, and argue, using an explicit example, that these divergences are artefact of perturbation and may not exist in the full nonlinear theory.</description>
