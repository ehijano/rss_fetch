      <title>Modeling of an electro-active pseudo-trilayer based on PEDOT, a semi-conductor polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroactive polymers are smart materials that can be used as actuators, sensors, or energy harvesters. We focus on a pseudo trilayer based on PEDOT, a semiconductor polymer: the central part consists of two interpenetrating polymers and PEDOT is polymerized on each side; the whole blade is saturated with an ionic liquid. A pseudo trilayer is obtained, the two outer layers acting as electrodes. When an electric field is applied, the cations move towards the negative electrode, making it swell, while the volume decreases on the opposite side; this results in the bending of the strip. Conversely, the film deflection generates an electric potential difference between the electrodes. We model this system and establish its constitutive relations using the thermodynamics of irreversible processes; we obtain a Kelvin--Voigt stress--strain relation and generalized Fourier's and Darcy's laws. We validate our model in the static case: we apply the latter to a cantilever blade subject to a continuous potential electric difference at the constant temperature. We draw the profiles of the different quantities and evaluate the tip displacement and the blocking force. Our results agree with the experimental data published in the literature.</description>

      <title>A CFD model for heat and mass transfer leading to plume formation within Wet Cooling Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crucial role played by Wet Cooling Towers (WCT) in many electricity production plants (e.g. nuclear power plants) make them a key parameter in the industrial design of such facilities. Their impact over the cooling water consumption and surrounding atmosphere through the formation and dispersion of a humid air plume has pushed the need to obtain proper models and simulations in order to anticipate those effects. In this work, we tackle this issue through a dedicated modelling in the CFD solver code_saturne. Specific modeling includes heat and mass transfer (convection and evaporation) between the injected water and the air flow that are validated against experimental results obtained in a reduced scale WCT experimental loop. Satisfying agreement is obtained for several parameters such as air and water exit temperatures, evaporation mass flow rate and total exchanged thermal power. This constitutes an important first step for detailed CFD predictions of WCT water consumption and humid air plume atmospheric dispersion.</description>
