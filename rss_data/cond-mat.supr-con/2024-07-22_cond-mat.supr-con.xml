      <title>Universal scaling relations in electron-phonon superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear scaling relations in electron-phonon superconductors. By combining numerical and analytical techniques, we find linear Homes scaling relations between the zero-temperature superfluid density and the normal-state DC conductivity. This is due to Galilean invariance being broken, either via a large impurity scattering rate or inelastic scattering of electrons and Einstein phonons at large electron-phonon coupling. Our work thus shows that Homes scaling is more universal than either cuprate or BCS-like physics, and is instead a fundamental result in a wide class of superconductors.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Waves in the 2.5-Dimensional Quantum Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) and their interplay with correlated and topological quantum states are forefront of condensed matter research. The 4$H_{b}$-TaS$_2$ is a CDW ordered quantum heterostructure that is formed by alternative stacking of Mott insulating 1T-TaS$_2$ and Ising superconducting 1H-TaS$_2$. While the $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ and 3$\times$3 CDWs have been respectively observed in the bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ and 2H-TaS$_2$, the CDWs and their pivotal role for unconventional superconductivity in the 4$H_{b}$-TaS$_2$ remain unsolved. In this letter, we reveal the 2-dimensional (2D) $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ chiral CDW in the 1T-layers and intra-unit cell coupled 2D 2$\times$2 CDW in the 1H and 1H' layers of 4$H_{b}$-TaS$_2$. Our results establish 4$H_{b}$-TaS$_2$ a novel 2.5D quantum heterostructure, where 2D quantum states emerge from 3D crystalline structure.</description>

      <title>Competitive helical bands and highly efficient diode effect in F/S/TI/S/F hybrid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diode effect in superconducting materials has been actively investigated in recent years. Plenty of different devices have been proposed as a platform to observe the superconducting diode effect. In this work we discuss the possibility of a highly efficient superconducting diode design with controllable polarity. We propose the mesoscopic device that consists of two separated superconducting islands with proximity induced ferromagnetism deposited on top of the three-dimensional topological insulator. Using the quasiclassical formalism of the Usadel equations we demonstrate that the sign of the diode efficiency can be controlled by magnetization tuning of a single superconducting island. Moreover, we show that the diode efficiency can be substantially increased in such device. We argue that the dramatic increase of the diode efficiency is due to competing contribution of the two superconducting islands to the supercurrent with single helical bands linked through the topological insulator surface.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Weight Crossover and Critical Temperature Enhancement in Singular Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-analytic Bloch eigenstates at isolated band degeneracy points exhibit singular behavior in the quantum metric. Here, a description of superfluid weight for zero-energy flat bands in proximity to other high-energy bands is presented, where they together form a singular band gap system. When the singular band gap closes, the geometric and conventional contributions to the superfluid weight as a function of the superconducting gap exhibit different crossover behaviors. The scaling behavior of superfluid weight with the band gap is studied in detail, and the effect on the Berezinskii-KosterlitzThouless (BKT) transition temperature is explored. It is discovered that tuning the singular band gap provides a unique mechanism for enhancing the supercurrent and critical temperature of two-dimensional (2D) superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplified scaling of the orbital upper critical field, $H_{c2}(T)$, for the isotropic case is discussed. To facilitate the analysis of the experimental data, we suggest a simple but accurate approximation in the entire temperature range of the scaled upper critical field valid for any transport scattering rate $H_{c2}/H_{c2}(0) \approx (1-t^2)/(1+0.42 \,t^{1.47})$.</description>

      <title>Unified Description of Charge Density Waves in Electron- and Hole-doped Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature cuprates superconductors are characterised by the complex interplay between superconductivity (SC) and charge density wave (CDW) in the context of intertwined competing orders. In contrast to abundant studies for hole-doped cuprates, the exact nature of CDW and its relationship to SC was much less explored in electron-doped counterparts. Here, we performed resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments to investigate the relationship between CDW and SC in electron-doped La$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. The short-range CDW order with a correlation length $\sim35$~\AA~was found in a wide range of temperature and doping concentration. Near the optimal doping, the CDW order is weakened inside the SC phase, implying an intimate relationship between the two orders. This interplay has been commonly reported in hole-doped La-based cuprates near the optimal doping. We reconciled the diverging behaviour of CDW across the superconducting phase in various cuprate materials by introducing the CDW correlation length as a key parameter. Our study paves the way for establishing a unified picture to describe the phenomenology of CDW and its relationship with SC in the cuprate family.</description>

      <title>Fermi arcs dominating the electronic surface properties of trigonal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials combining topologically non-trivial behavior and superconductivity offer a potential route for quantum computation. However, the set of available materials intrinsically realizing these properties are scarce. Recently, surface superconductivity has been reported in PtBi$_2$ in its trigonal phase and an inherent Weyl semimetal phase has been predicted. Here, based on scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, we reveal the signature of topological Fermi arcs in the normal state patterns of the quasiparticle interference. We show that the scattering between Fermi arcs dominates the interference spectra, providing conclusive evidence for the relevance of Weyl fermiology for the surface electronic properties of trigonal PtBi$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to use linearly polarized light to imprint superconducting vortices. Within the framework of the generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations we demonstrate the induction of the coherent vortex pairs that are moving in phase with electormagnetic wave oscillations. The overall vorticity of the superconductor remain zero throughout the cycle. Our results uncover rich multiscale dynamics of SC vorticity and suggest new optical applications for various types of structured light.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of SU(2) gauge theory coupled to four adjoint Higgs fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories with matter fields in various representations play an important role in different branches of physics. Recently, it was proposed that several aspects of the interesting pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors near optimal doping may be explained by an emergent $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. Around the transition with positive hole-doping, one can construct a $(2+1)-$dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory coupled to four adjoint scalar fields which gives rise to a rich phase diagram with a myriad of phases having different broken symmetries. We study the phase diagram of this model on the Euclidean lattice using the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We find the existence of multiple broken phases as predicted by previous mean field studies. Depending on the quartic couplings, the $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is broken down either to $U(1)$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the perturbative description of the model. We further study the confinement-deconfinement transition in this theory, and find that both the broken phases are deconfining. However, there exists a marked difference in the behavior of the Polyakov loop between the two phases.</description>

      <title>Surface superconductivity in the topological Weyl semimetal t-PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of quantum computation is eager on generating fault tolerant qubits, and topological superconductivity is a very promising concept for reaching this goal. Early experimental achievements study hybrid systems as well as doped intrinsic topological or superconducting materials presenting the phenomena at very low temperatures. However, higher critical temperatures are indispensable for technological exploitation. Promising very recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results reveal that superconductivity of the type-I Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi$_2$ (t-PtBi$_2$) is located at the Fermi arcs surface states which renders t-PtBi$_2$ a candidate for intrinsic topological superconductivity. Here we show, using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) that t-PtBi$_2$ presents surface superconductivity at elevated temperatures (5 K). The gap magnitude is elusive: it is spatially inhomogeneous and spans from 0 to 20 meV. In particular, the large gap value and the shape of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum resemble the phenomenology of high-Tc superconductors. To our knowledge, this is the largest superconducting gap so far measured in a topological material. Moreover, we show that the superconducting state at 5 K persists up to 12 T magnetic field. Thus, we show that t-PtBi2 is a prime candidate for intrinsic topological superconductivity at technologically relevant temperatures, fields and gap magnitudes.</description>

      <title>First-principles exploration of superconductivity in intercalated bilayer borophene phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of phonon-mediated superconductivity in bilayer borophenes by controlled intercalation with elements from the groups of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals, using systematic first-principles and Eliashberg calculations. We show that the superconducting properties are primarily governed by the interplay between the out-of-plane ($p_{z}$) boron states and the partially occupied in-plane ($s+p_{x,y}$) bonding states at the Fermi level. Our Eliashberg calculations indicate that intercalation with alkaline-earth elements leads to the highest superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{c}$). Specifically, Be in $\delta_{4}$, Mg in $\chi_{3}$, and Ca in the kagome bilayer borophene demonstrate superior performance with $T_{c}$ reaching up to 58~K. Our study therefore reveals that intercalated bilayer borophene phases are not only more resilient to chemical deterioration, but also harbor enhanced $T_{c}$ values compared to their monolayer counterparts, underscoring their substantial potential for the development of boron-based two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a distinct collective mode in Kagome superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective modes of the superconducting order parameter fluctuation can provide key insights into the nature of the superconductor. Recently, a family of superconductors has emerged in non-magnetic kagome material AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs), exhibiting fertile emergent phenomenology. However, the collective behaviors of Cooper pairs have not been studied. Here, we report a distinct collective mode in CsV3-xTaxSb5 using scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. The spectral line-shape is well-described by one isotropic and one anisotropic superconducting gap, and a bosonic mode due to electron-mode coupling. With increasing x, the two gaps move closer in energy, merge into two isotropic gaps of equal amplitude, and then increase synchronously. The mode energy decreases monotonically to well below 2{\Delta} and survives even after the charge density wave order is suppressed. We propose the interpretation of this collective mode as Leggett mode between different superconducting components or the Bardasis-Schrieffer mode due to a subleading superconducting component.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports a gapless (Goldstone) magnon mode. In particular, we develop a scenario wherein pairing in the spin-canted state emerges from a novel type of magnon-mediated attraction: Contrary to conventional mechanisms that involve the exchange of a single boson, we show that second-order processes that exchange two magnons are dominant and produce an $s$-wave pairing interaction featuring a unique logarithmic low-frequency divergence. This low-frequency divergence disappears when spin-orbit coupling vanishes, providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <title>Inherently dissipative normal currents during thermodynamic changes of state in superconductors: Joule heating vs. magnetocaloric cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thermodynamic change of state in the Meissner phase of a superconductor at finite temperature, such as the cooling or the heating it in a constant external magnetic field, inevitably generates normal currents of unpaired electrons. These currents are induced by the time-dependent variations in the local magnetic-flux density associated with the imposed change of state. They may not only lead to certain deviations of the magnetic-field distribution from textbook Meissner profiles, but also cause dissipative Joule heating, which appears to be at odds with the expected reversibility in a truly thermodynamic superconducting state. We show that these normal currents also produce a magnetocaloric cooling, which in total instantaneously and precisely compensates for the dissipated heat, thus ensuring overall energy conservation and reversibility in terms of energy. However, the time-dependent Joule heating and magnetocaloric cooling processes are spatially distinct and therefore must result in small temperature inhomogeneities that will only fade away towards thermodynamic equilibrium after the thermodynamic change of state has halted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strange metals develop near quantum critical points (QCPs) in a variety of strongly correlated systems. Some of the important issues include how the quantum critical state loses quasiparticles, how it drives superconductivity, and to what extent the strange-metal physics in different classes of correlated systems is interconnected. In this review, we confront some of these issues from the vantage point of heavy fermion metals. We will describe the notion of Kondo destruction and how it leads to a transformation of the Fermi surface from ``large" to ``small" when the system is tuned across the QCP, a loss of quasiparticles everywhere on the Fermi surface when it is perched at the QCP, and a dynamical Planckian scaling in various physical properties including charge responses. We close with a brief discussion about the connections between the strange-metal physics in heavy fermion metals and its counterparts in the cuprates and other correlated materials.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the performance of traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) based on nonlinear elements like superconducting Josephson junctions (JJs) is vital for qubit read-out in quantum computers. The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to demonstrate how nonlinear inductors based on combinations of JJs can be modeled in commercial circuit simulators, and (b) to show how the harmonic balance (HB) is used in the reliable prediction of the amplifier performance e.g., gain and pump harmonic power conversion. Experimental characterization of two types of TWPA architectures is compared with simulations to showcase the reliability of the HB method. We disseminate the modeling know-how and techniques to new designers of parametric amplifiers.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the electrical properties of fabricated thermally oxidized amorphous aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions. Using conventional test equipment to apply an alternating bias to a heated tunnel barrier, giant increases in the room temperature resistance, greater than 70%, can be achieved. The rate of resistance change is shown to be strongly temperature-dependent, and is independent of junction size in the sub-micron regime. In order to measure their tunneling properties at mK temperatures, we characterized transmon qubit junctions treated with this alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique. The measured frequencies follow the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the shifted resistance and critical current. Further, these studies show a reduction of junction-contributed loss on the order of $\approx 2 \times10^{-6}$, along with a significant reduction in resonant- and off-resonant-two level system defects when compared to untreated samples. Imaging with high-resolution TEM shows that the barrier is still predominantly amorphous with a more uniform distribution of aluminum coordination across the barrier relative to untreated junctions. This new approach is expected to be widely applicable to a broad range of devices that rely on amorphous aluminum oxide, as well as the many other metal-insulator-metal structures used in modern electronics.</description>
