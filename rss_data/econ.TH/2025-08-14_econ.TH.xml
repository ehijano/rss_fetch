      <title>Swap Bounded Envy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fairness in the allocation of discrete goods. Exactly fair (envy-free) allocations are impossible, so we discuss notions of approximate fairness. In particular, we focus on allocations in which the swap of two items serves to eliminate any envy, either for the allocated bundles or with respect to a reference bundle. We propose an algorithm that, under some restrictions on agents' preferences, achieves an allocation with ``swap bounded envy.''</description>

      <title>Sequential Non-Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of persuasion in which the receiver is a `conservative Bayesian' whose updated belief is a convex combination of the prior and the correct Bayesian posterior. While in the classic Bayesian case providing information sequentially is never valuable, we show that the sender gains from sequential persuasion in many of the environments considered in the literature on strategic information transmission. We also consider the case in which the sender and receiver are both biased and prove that the maximal expected payoff for the sender under sequential persuasion is the same as in the case where neither of them is biased.</description>

      <title>Influence and Connectivity in Networks: A Generating Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many widely used network centralities are based on counting walks that meet specific criteria. This paper introduces a systematic framework for walk enumeration using generating functions. We introduce a first-passage decomposition that uniquely divides any walk passing through specified nodes or links into two components: a first-reaching walk and a subsequent walk. This decomposition yields a system of interconnected equations that relate three disjoint categories of walks: unrestricted walks, walks that avoid specific elements, and walks that pass through designated sets. The framework offers a range of applications, including evaluating the effects of structural interventions, such as node or link modifications, on network walks, generalizing target centrality to multi-receiver scenarios in information networks, and comparing different strategies for adding links.</description>

      <title>The asymmetrical Acquisition of information about the range of asset value in market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information investors acquire in asset markets has various forms. We refer to range information as information about the upper and lower bound which the payoff of an asset may reach in the future. This paper explores the market impacts of investors' asymmetrical acquisition of range information. Uninformed traders are inherently unable to directly obtain the private signal held by informed traders. This study shows that when range information is released to investors asymmetrically, uninformed traders who can only obtain rougher range information will not trade assets under the max-min ambiguity aversion criterion. Investors' asymmetrical acquisition of range information can cause that market liquidity and the sensitivity of market price to private signal vary continuously with the signal and noise trading volume. We also reveal that investors' asymmetrical acquisition of range information can increase market liquidity and the sensitivity of price under some conditions and decrease them under some other conditions.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics of strategic classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are nowadays applied in high-stakes decisions in finance, healthcare, criminal justice, or education. Individuals can strategically adapt to the information gathered about classifiers, which in turn may require algorithms to be re-trained. Which collective dynamics will result from users' adaptation and algorithms' retraining? We apply evolutionary game theory to address this question. Our framework provides a mathematically rigorous way of treating the problem of feedback loops between collectives of users and institutions, allowing to test interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of strategic adaptation. As a case study, we consider institutions deploying algorithms for credit lending. We consider several scenarios, each representing different interaction paradigms. When algorithms are not robust against strategic manipulation, we are able to capture previous challenges discussed in the strategic classification literature, whereby users either pay excessive costs to meet the institutions' expectations (leading to high social costs) or game the algorithm (e.g., provide fake information). From this baseline setting, we test the role of improving gaming detection and providing algorithmic recourse. We show that increased detection capabilities reduce social costs and could lead to users' improvement; when perfect classifiers are not feasible (likely to occur in practice), algorithmic recourse can steer the dynamics towards high users' improvement rates. The speed at which the institutions re-adapt to the user's population plays a role in the final outcome. Finally, we explore a scenario where strict institutions provide actionable recourse to their unsuccessful users and observe cycling dynamics so far unnoticed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Inertial Coordination Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze inertial coordination games: dynamic coordination games with an endogenously changing state that depends on (i) a persistent fundamental players privately learn about over time; and (ii) past play. The speed of learning determines long-run equilibrium dynamics: the risk-dominant action is played in the limit if and only if learning is slow such that posterior precisions grow sub-quadratically. This generalizes results from static global games and endows them with a learning foundation. Conversely, when learning is fast such that posterior precisions grow super-quadratically, shocks can propagate and generate self-fulfilling spirals.</description>
