      <title>Deep networks learn to parse uniform-depth context-free languages from local statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the structure of language can be learned from sentences alone is a central question in both cognitive science and machine learning. Studies of the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) support their ability to parse text when predicting the next word, while representing semantic notions independently of surface form. Yet, which data statistics make these feats possible, and how much data is required, remain largely unknown. Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) provide a tractable testbed for studying these questions. However, prior work has focused either on the post-hoc characterization of the parsing-like algorithms used by trained networks; or on the learnability of PCFGs with fixed syntax, where parsing is unnecessary. Here, we (i) introduce a tunable class of PCFGs in which both the degree of ambiguity and the correlation structure across scales can be controlled; (ii) provide a learning mechanism -- an inference algorithm inspired by the structure of deep convolutional networks -- that links learnability and sample complexity to specific language statistics; and (iii) validate our predictions empirically across deep convolutional and transformer-based architectures. Overall, we propose a unifying framework where correlations at different scales lift local ambiguities, enabling the emergence of hierarchical representations of the data.</description>

      <title>Elastoplastic Modelling of Cyclic Shear Deformation of Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an energy-landscape based elasto-plastic model to understand the behaviour of amorphous solids under uniform and cyclic shear. Amorphous solids are modeled as being composed of mesoscopic sub-volumes, each of which may occupy states - termed mesostates -- drawn from a specified distribution. The energies of the mesostates under stress free conditions determine their stability range with respect to applied strain, and their plastic strain, at which they are stress free, forms an important additional property. Under applied global strain, mesostates that reach their stability limits transition to other permissible mesostates. Barring such transitions, which encompass plastic deformations that the solid may undergo, mesostates are treated as exhibiting linear elastic behavior, and the interactions between mesoscopic blocks are treated using the finite element method. The model reproduces known phenomena under uniform and cyclic shear, such as the brittle-to-ductile crossover with annealing and the Bauschinger effect for uniform shear, qualitative features of the yielding diagram under cyclic shear including the change in yielding behaviour with the degree of annealing, across a `threshold level', and dynamic phenomena such as the divergence of failure times on approach to the yield point and the non-monotonic evolution of the local yield rate. In addition to these results, we discuss the dependence of the observed behaviour on model choices, and open questions highlighted by our work.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Limit of Stochastic Gradient Flow via Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models are typically trained via multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with small batch sizes, and understanding their dynamics in high dimensions is of great interest. However, an analytical framework for describing the high-dimensional asymptotic behavior of multi-pass SGD with small batch sizes for nonlinear models is currently missing. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing the high-dimensional dynamics of a stochastic differential equation called a \emph{stochastic gradient flow} (SGF), which approximates multi-pass SGD in this regime. In the limit where the number of data samples $n$ and the dimension $d$ grow proportionally, we derive a closed system of low-dimensional and continuous-time equations and prove that it characterizes the asymptotic distribution of the SGF parameters. Our theory is based on the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and is applicable to a wide range of models encompassing generalized linear models and two-layer neural networks. We further show that the resulting DMFT equations recover several existing high-dimensional descriptions of SGD dynamics as special cases, thereby providing a unifying perspective on prior frameworks such as online SGD and high-dimensional linear regression. Our proof builds on the existing DMFT technique for gradient flow and extends it to handle the stochasticity in SGF using tools from stochastic calculus.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Analysis of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being probabilistic models, during inference large language models (LLMs) display rare events: behaviour that is far from typical but highly significant. By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.</description>

      <title>Topological Symmetry Breaking in Antagonistic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, often approximated by an 80:20 ratio, underlies the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning enables the fine-tuning of internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli and ensuring robust performance. Engineered systems with antagonistic interactions remain comparatively unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked to frustration mechanisms in the underlying network. In this context, spin-glass theory has shown how apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic and chaotic behavior can arise from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states that prevent the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we show how topology constrains dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We use the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical structure and the complex energy landscape of the system. This reveals novel and highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of emergent multistability and non-ergodicity in frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Topological marker in three dimensions based on kernel polynomial method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic-scale influence of disorder on the topological order can be quantified by a universal topological marker, although the practical calculation of the marker becomes numerically very costly in higher dimensions. We propose that for any symmetry class in higher dimensions, the topological marker can be calculated in a very efficient way by adopting the kernel polynomial method. Using class AII in three dimensions as an example, which is relevant to realistic topological insulators like Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, this method reveals the criteria for the invariance of topological order in the presence of disorder, as well as the possibility of a smooth cross over between two topological phases caused by disorder. In addition, the significantly enlarged system size in the numerical calculation implies that this method is capable of capturing the quantum criticality much closer to topological phase transitions, as demonstrated by a nonlocal topological marker.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Heterogeneity in Physical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics.
  We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, microampere currents, 2 MHz speeds and ~750 fJ per nonlinear operation, with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales.
  We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Bound State Geometry in High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the non-Hermitian effect (NHSE), due to its non-reciprocal nature, creates barriers for the appearance of impurity bound states. In this paper, we find that in two and higher dimensions, the presence of geometry-dependent skin effect eliminates this barrier such that even an infinitesimal impurity potential can confine bound states in this type of non-Hermitian systems. By examining bound states around Bloch saddle points, we find that non-Hermiticity can disrupt the isotropy of bound states, resulting in concave dumbbell-shaped bound states. Our work reveals a geometry transition of bound state between concavity and convexity in high-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, offering theoretical insights for the experimental manipulation of bound states.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Interacting Random Graph Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random graphs offer a useful mathematical representation of a variety of real world complex networks. Exponential random graphs, for example, are particularly suited towards generating random graphs constrained to have specified statistical moments. In this investigation, we elaborate on a generalization of the former where link probabilities are conditioned on the appearance of other links, corresponding to the introduction of interactions in an effective generalized statistical mechanical formalism. When restricted to the simplest non-trivial case of pairwise interactions, one can derive a closed form renormalization group transformation for maximum coordination number two on the corresponding line graph. Higher coordination numbers do not admit exact closed form renormalization group transformations, a feature that paraphrases the usual absence of exact transformations in two or more dimensional lattice systems. We introduce disorder and study the induced renormalization group flow on its probability assignments, highlighting its formal equivalence to time reversed anisotropic drift-diffusion on the statistical manifold associated with the effective Hamiltonian. We discuss the implications of our findings, stressing the long wavelength irrelevance of certain classes of pair-wise conditioning on random graphs, and conclude with possible applications. These include modeling the scaling behavior of preferential effects on social networks, opinion dynamics, and reinforcement effects on neural networks, as well as how our findings offer a systematic framework to deal with data limitations in inference and reconstruction problems.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.84522$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Classical Spin Hamiltonians Based on Matrix Product Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a tensor-network (TN) approach for solving classical optimization problems that is inspired by spectral filtering and sampling on quantum states. We first shift and scale an Ising Hamiltonian of the cost function so that all eigenvalues become non-negative and the ground states correspond to the the largest eigenvalues, which are then amplified by power iteration. We represent the transformed Hamiltonian as a matrix product operator (MPO) and form an immense power of this object via truncated MPO-MPO contractions, embedding the resulting operator into a matrix product state for sampling in the computational basis. In contrast to the density-matrix renormalization group, our approach provides a straightforward route to systematic improvement by increasing the bond dimension and is better at avoiding local minima. We also study the performance of this power method in the context of a higher-order Ising Hamiltonian on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, making a comparison with simulated annealing. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms for solving optimization problems and provide a baseline for assessing and developing quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Probing Anharmonic and Heterogeneous Carrier Dynamics Across Sublattice Melting in a Minimal Model Superionic Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the microscopic origin of sublattice melting and fast ion transport in superionic conductors remains elusive. Here, we introduce a chemically neutral minimal binary model consisting of a rigid host lattice stabilized by short-range steric repulsion and a soft carrier sublattice interacting via long-range Wigner-type forces. This contrast naturally produces distinct melting temperatures and an intermediate sublattice-melting phase in which carriers become fluidlike while the host remains crystalline. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify three dynamical regimes-crystalline, sublattice-melt, and fully molten-marked by sharp changes in diffusivity, structural correlations, and dynamic heterogeneity. Near sublattice melting, carrier motion is strongly anharmonic and spatially heterogeneous, beyond mean-field hopping descriptions. By tuning the density, we demonstrate that sublattice melting can be continuously controlled, establishing a direct link between lattice softness, anharmonicity, and collective ion transport. This work provides a unified microscopic foundation for designing mechanically robust, high-performance superionic conductors operable near ambient conditions.</description>
