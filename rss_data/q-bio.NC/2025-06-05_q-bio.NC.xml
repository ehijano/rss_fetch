      <title>A Pre-trained Framework for Multilingual Brain Decoding Using Non-invasive Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with speech decoding from brain recordings have broad application potential in fields such as clinical rehabilitation and cognitive neuroscience. However, current decoding methods remain limited to single-language, single-subject, and single neuroimaging modality settings, restricting their clinical applicability and generalizability. Here we propose a joint multilingual, multi-subject and multimodal decoding framework. It maps diverse brain recordings into a unified semantic space defined by a pre-trained multilingual model (PMM), enabling decoding across multiple languages, multiple subjects and multiple neuroimaging modalities. The proposed framework is validated using non-invasive brain recordings from 159 participants across four languages. Experimental results show that it exhibits strong generalization across multilingual, multi-subject, and multimodal settings. More importantly, the proposed framework can promote linguistic fairness, which is vital for underrepresented languages in BCI applications. The unified semantic space enables cross-lingual mapping enhancement, allowing the framework to boost the decoding performance of underrepresented languages, thereby promoting linguistic fairness. Overall, the proposed framework establishes a new potential paradigm for brain decoding, opening new paths for broader applications of BCI.</description>

      <title>Learning to cluster neuronal function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks trained to predict neural activity from visual input and behaviour have shown great potential to serve as digital twins of the visual cortex. Per-neuron embeddings derived from these models could potentially be used to map the functional landscape or identify cell types. However, state-of-the-art predictive models of mouse V1 do not generate functional embeddings that exhibit clear clustering patterns which would correspond to cell types. This raises the question whether the lack of clustered structure is due to limitations of current models or a true feature of the functional organization of mouse V1. In this work, we introduce DECEMber -- Deep Embedding Clustering via Expectation Maximization-based refinement -- an explicit inductive bias into predictive models that enhances clustering by adding an auxiliary $t$-distribution-inspired loss function that enforces structured organization among per-neuron embeddings. We jointly optimize both neuronal feature embeddings and clustering parameters, updating cluster centers and scale matrices using the EM-algorithm. We demonstrate that these modifications improve cluster consistency while preserving high predictive performance and surpassing standard clustering methods in terms of stability. Moreover, DECEMber generalizes well across species (mice, primates) and visual areas (retina, V1, V4).

      <title>Robust Scaling in Human Brain Dynamics Despite Latent Variables and Limited Sampling Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea that information-processing systems operate near criticality to enhance computational performance is supported by scaling signatures in brain activity. However, external signals raise the question of whether this behavior is intrinsic or input-driven. We show that autocorrelated inputs and temporal resolution influence observed scaling exponents in simple neural models. We also demonstrate analytically that under subsampling, non-critical systems driven by independent autocorrelated signals can exhibit strong signatures of apparent criticality. To address these pitfalls, we develop a robust framework and apply it to pooled neural data, revealing resting-state brain activity at the population level is slightly sub-critical yet near-critical. Notably, the extracted critical exponents closely match predictions from a simple recurrent firing-rate model, supporting the emergence of near-critical dynamics from reverberant network activity, with potential implications for information processing and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Sub-Scalp EEG for Sensorimotor Brain-Computer Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To establish sub-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) as a viable option for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, particularly for chronic use, by demonstrating its effectiveness in recording and classifying sensorimotor neural activity. Approach: Two experiments were conducted in this study. The first aim was to demonstrate the high spatial resolution of sub-scalp EEG through analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials in sheep models. The second focused on the practical application of sub-scalp EEG, classifying motor execution using data collected during a sheep behavioural experiment. Main Results: We successfully demonstrated the recording of sensorimotor rhythms using sub-scalp EEG in sheep models. Important spatial, temporal, and spectral features of these signals were identified, and we were able to classify motor execution with above-chance performance. These results are comparable to previous work that investigated signal quality and motor execution classification using ECoG and endovascular arrays in sheep models. Significance: These results suggest that sub-scalp EEG may provide signal quality that approaches that of more invasive neural recording methods such as ECoG and endovascular arrays, and support the use of sub-scalp EEG for chronic BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Brain-tuned Speech Models Better Reflect Speech Processing Stages in the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained self-supervised speech models excel in speech tasks but do not reflect the hierarchy of human speech processing, as they encode rich semantics in middle layers and poor semantics in late layers. Recent work showed that brain-tuning (fine-tuning models using human brain recordings) improves speech models' semantic understanding. Here, we examine how well brain-tuned models further reflect the brain's intermediate stages of speech processing. We find that late layers of brain-tuned models substantially improve over pretrained models in their alignment with semantic language regions. Further layer-wise probing reveals that early layers remain dedicated to low-level acoustic features, while late layers become the best at complex high-level tasks. These findings show that brain-tuned models not only perform better but also exhibit a well-defined hierarchical processing going from acoustic to semantic representations, making them better model organisms for human speech processing.</description>

      <title>From Spikes to Speech: NeuroVoc -- A Biologically Plausible Vocoder Framework for Auditory Perception and Cochlear Implant Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present NeuroVoc, a flexible model-agnostic vocoder framework that reconstructs acoustic waveforms from simulated neural activity patterns using an inverse Fourier transform. The system applies straightforward signal processing to neurogram representations, time-frequency binned outputs from auditory nerve fiber models. Crucially, the model architecture is modular, allowing for easy substitution or modification of the underlying auditory models. This flexibility eliminates the need for speech-coding-strategy-specific vocoder implementations when simulating auditory perception in cochlear implant (CI) users. It also allows direct comparisons between normal hearing (NH) and electrical hearing (EH) models, as demonstrated in this study. The vocoder preserves distinctive features of each model; for example, the NH model retains harmonic structure more faithfully than the EH model. We evaluated perceptual intelligibility in noise using an online Digits-in-Noise (DIN) test, where participants completed three test conditions: one with standard speech, and two with vocoded speech using the NH and EH models. Both the standard DIN test and the EH-vocoded groups were statistically equivalent to clinically reported data for NH and CI listeners. On average, the NH and EH vocoded groups increased SRT compared to the standard test by 2.4 dB and 7.1 dB, respectively. These findings show that, although some degradation occurs, the vocoder can reconstruct intelligible speech under both hearing models and accurately reflects the reduced speech-in-noise performance experienced by CI users.</description>

      <title>Multiplex Nodal Modularity: A novel network metric for the regional analysis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment during a working memory binding task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modularity is a well-established concept for assessing community structures in various single and multi-layer networks, including those in biological and social domains. Brain networks are known to exhibit community structure at local, meso, and global scale. However, modularity is limited as a metric to a global scale describing the overall strength of community structure, overlooking important variations in community structure at node level. To address this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel measure of nodal modularity (nQ) captures both mesoscale and local-scale changes in modularity. We hypothesized that nQ would illuminate granular changes in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored nQ in multiplex networks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the early stages of AD. While limited by sample size, changes in nQ for individual regions of interest (ROIs) in our fMRI networks were predominantly observed in visual, limbic, and paralimbic systems in the brain, aligning with known AD trajectories and linked to amyloid-$\beta$ and tau deposition. Furthermore, observed changes in white-matter microstructure in our DTI networks in parietal and frontal regions may compliment studies of white-matter integrity in poor memory binders. Additionally, nQ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters indicating that nQ may be sensitive to this key turning point of AD. Our findings demonstrate the utility of nQ as a measure of localized group structure, providing novel insights into task and disease-related variability at the node level. Given the widespread application of modularity as a global measure, nQ represents a significant advancement, providing a granular measure of network organization applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phases of short-term memory mechanisms in RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-term memory is essential for cognitive processing, yet our understanding of its neural mechanisms remains unclear. Neuroscience has long focused on how sequential activity patterns, where neurons fire one after another within large networks, can explain how information is maintained. While recurrent connections were shown to drive sequential dynamics, a mechanistic understanding of this process still remains unknown. In this work, we introduce two unique mechanisms that can support this form of short-term memory: slow-point manifolds generating direct sequences or limit cycles providing temporally localized approximations. Using analytical models, we identify fundamental properties that govern the selection of each mechanism. Precisely, on short-term memory tasks (delayed cue-discrimination tasks), we derive theoretical scaling laws for critical learning rates as a function of the delay period length, beyond which no learning is possible. We empirically verify these results by training and evaluating approximately 80,000 recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are publicly available for further analysis. Overall, our work provides new insights into short-term memory mechanisms and proposes experimentally testable predictions for systems neuroscience.</description>

      <title>MammAlps: A multi-view video behavior monitoring dataset of wild mammals in the Swiss Alps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring wildlife is essential for ecology and ethology, especially in light of the increasing human impact on ecosystems. Camera traps have emerged as habitat-centric sensors enabling the study of wildlife populations at scale with minimal disturbance. However, the lack of annotated video datasets limits the development of powerful video understanding models needed to process the vast amount of fieldwork data collected. To advance research in wild animal behavior monitoring we present MammAlps, a multimodal and multi-view dataset of wildlife behavior monitoring from 9 camera-traps in the Swiss National Park. MammAlps contains over 14 hours of video with audio, 2D segmentation maps and 8.5 hours of individual tracks densely labeled for species and behavior. Based on 6135 single animal clips, we propose the first hierarchical and multimodal animal behavior recognition benchmark using audio, video and reference scene segmentation maps as inputs. Furthermore, we also propose a second ecology-oriented benchmark aiming at identifying activities, species, number of individuals and meteorological conditions from 397 multi-view and long-term ecological events, including false positive triggers. We advocate that both tasks are complementary and contribute to bridging the gap between machine learning and ecology. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/eceo-epfl/MammAlps</description>

      <title>Modular integration of neural connectomics, dynamics and biomechanics for identification of behavioral sensorimotor pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational approaches which emulate in-vivo nervous system are needed to investigate mechanisms of the brain to orchestrate behavior. Such approaches must integrate a series of biophysical models encompassing the nervous system, muscles, biomechanics to allow observing the system in its entirety while supporting model variations. Here we develop modWorm: a modular modeling framework for the nematode C. elegans. modWorm allows for construction of a model as an integrated series of configurable, exchangeable modules each describing specific biophysical processes across different modalities. Utilizing modWorm, we propose a base neuro-mechanical model for C. elegans built upon the complete connectome. The model integrates a series of 7 modules: i) intra-cellular dynamics, ii) electrical and iii) chemical extra-cellular neural dynamics, iv) translation of neural activity to muscle calcium dynamics, v) muscle calcium dynamics to muscle forces, vi) muscle forces to body postures and vii) proprioceptive feedback. We validate the base model by in-silico injection of constant currents into neurons known to be associated with locomotion behaviors and by applying external forces to the body. Applications of in-silico neural stimuli experimentally known to modulate locomotion show that the model can recapitulate natural behavioral responses such as forward and backward locomotion as well as mid-locomotion responses such as avoidance and turns. Furthermore, through in-silico ablation surveys, the model can infer novel neural circuits involved in sensorimotor behaviors. To further dissect mechanisms of locomotion, we utilize modWorm to introduce empirical based model variations and model optimizations to elucidate their effects on simulated locomotion. Our results show that modWorm can be utilized to identify neural circuits which control, mediate and generate natural behavior.</description>
