      <title>Electromagnetic Radiation from Baryon-Rich Matter in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a study of electromagnetic radiation in heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) Beam Energy Scan (BES) and SPS energies using the iEBE-MUSIC framework, which includes 3D dynamical Monte Carlo Glauber initial conditions, MUSIC (3+1)D viscous relativistic hydrodynamics, and the UrQMD hadronic afterburner. The multistage modeling has been calibrated to hadronic data at RHIC-BES energies using a Bayesian analysis. Integrating the thermal photon emission rates with the medium evolution, we study the direct photon yield and elliptic flow and how they vary with collision energy and emission source. We compare with results obtained by the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations. We employ next-to-leading order thermal QCD dilepton emission rates to compute dilepton invariant mass spectra and extract the effective temperature of the quark-gluon plasma at different collision energies.</description>

      <title>Nuclear shape dynamics in low-energy heavy-ion reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss recent theoretical developments in low-energy heavy-ion reactions. To this end, we put emphasis on a viewpoint of probing nuclear shapes with heavy-ion reactions. We first discuss a single-channel problem with an optical potential model. We particularly discuss a microscopic modeling of the imaginary part of an optical potential as well as a visualization of quantum interference phenomena observed in heavy-ion elastic scattering. We then discuss multi-channel scattering problems, and demonstrate that heavy-ion fusion reactions at energies around the Coulomb barrier are sensitive to the shape of colliding nuclei, providing a powerful tool to probe nuclear shapes. We finally point out that relativistic heavy-ion collisions have large similarities to low-energy heavy-ion reactions in the context of nuclear shape dynamics.</description>

      <title>Explaining higher-order correlations between elliptic and triangular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration has analyzed a number of cumulants mixing elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), involving up to $8$ particles, in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We unravel an unexpected simplicity in these complex mathematical quantities for collisions at fixed impact parameter. We show that as one increases the order in $v_2$, for a given order in $v_3$, the changes in the cumulants are solely determined by the mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane, which originates from the almond-shaped geometry of the overlap area between the colliding nuclei. We derive simple analytic relations between cumulants of different orders on this basis. Some of these relations are in reasonable agreement with existing data. We postulate that agreement will be much improved if the analysis is repeated with a finer centrality binning and a larger pseudorapidity acceptance.</description>

      <title>Nuclear surface energy solving Hartree-Fock equations with Gogny interactions using Lagrange mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hartree Fock equations for finite range interactions in a slab of nuclear matter are presented and solved using an algorithm based on the Lagrange mesh method. This approach is faster and more efficient than the Numerov algorithm commonly used in the literature. Thanks to the improved numerical accuracy, we were able to perform calculations with sufficiently large boxes to minimize the impact of Friedel oscillations on the final results, achieving a precision on the surface energy within a few dozens of keV. Results are presented for several Gogny interactions that have not been previously discussed. In addition, the inclusion of the spin orbit term is examined, showing a net reduction of 1.2-1.9 MeV in the surface energy.</description>

      <title>Analytical Solution and Lie Algebra of the Relativistic Boltzmann Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel and more efficient approach to constructing the relativistic BKW (Bobylev, Krook, and Wu) solution. By introducing a class of ansatz functions for the distribution function, we demonstrate that within this specific ansatz space, only the equilibrium and BKW-type forms yield exact solutions to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation. Furthermore, guided by physical insight and drawing upon the framework of relativistic kinetic theory, we derive the Lie algebra of invariant transformations admitted by the relativistic Boltzmann equation. From this algebra, the corresponding symmetry group transformations can be systematically constructed.</description>

      <title>Isospin-breaking in the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude I: Effects due to the pion mass difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers devoted to a detailed analysis of isospin-breaking effects in the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude and the vector form factor of the pion. Isospin breaking originates from the mass difference between up and down quarks and from electromagnetic effects. The latter can be further split into effects due to the pion-mass difference and the remaining virtual and real photonic effects. In this paper, we derive the modifications to the Roy equations for $\pi\pi$ scattering due to the mass difference between the charged and the neutral pion. We solve the equations numerically after matching them to the chiral representation of the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude evaluated in the same approximation, which is also provided. Numerical results are presented and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Correlations between heavy mesons and the creation of the charmonia, bottomonia, and $B_c$ mesons in high energy $pp$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The different QCD processes, which can produce a heavy quark-antiquark ($Q\bar Q$) pair, induce different correlations between the heavy quarks. Employing the EPOS4HQ event generator we study the consequences of these correlations and compare the calculation with experimental results on open and hidden heavy flavour mesons, measured in proton-proton (pp) collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We find that the measured correlations between heavy mesons are a direct image of the different production mechanisms, which contribute also in a different way to the transverse momentum distribution of open and hidden heavy flavour mesons. The latter are calculated in a Wigner density approach which also enables to reproduce quantitatively the measured $B_c$ spectra. This agreement allows conclusions on the spatial distribution of the heavy quark creation processes.</description>

      <title>The color force acting on a quark in the pion and nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of hard scattering amplitudes, the twist-3 operators describe local colored Lorentz forces acting on a quark, thereby providing a measure of the strength of the gluon fields. Its value is directly accessible from the nucleon twist-3 polarized $g_2$-parton distribution function. In the semiclassical (instanton-based) QCD vacuum models, the leading non-perturbative contribution stems from correlated instanton-anti-instanton pairs, or molecules. We analyze the magnitude of the color force on a 'struck' quark in light hadrons (pion and nucleon), in the context of the instanton liquid model (ILM). We derive explicitly the pertinent form factors associated to the color Lorenz force, and show that they are intimately related to the pertinent hadronic gravitational and transversity form factors. Using the ILM enhanced by molecules, we detail the ensuing colored force distribution in the transverse plane for luminal pions and nucleons. The results for the nucleons are in good agreement with those reported recently from a lattice collaboration.</description>

      <title>Strongly intensive quantities for rapidity correlations of multiplicities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter created in nuclear collisions are typically carried out using event-by-event fluctuations. Well-known way to disentangle statistical and dynamical fluctuations is to construct special observables named strongly intensive which are free from trivial volume fluctuations. Within the color string model behavior of the second-order strongly intensive quantity $\Sigma$ is completely determined by the two-particle correlation function from a single string and the string fusion mechanism. In this paper, we analyze third-order strongly intensive observable for forward-backward rapidity correlations and test its behavior within the PYTHIA8 model.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Computing and Nuclear Structure: Atomic Nuclei on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate quantum simulations of strongly correlated nuclear many-body systems on the RIKEN-Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting ground states of oxygen, calcium, and nickel isotopes. By combining a hard-core-boson representation of the nuclear shell model with a pair-unitary coupled-cluster doubles ansatz, we achieve sub-percent relative error in the ground-state energies compared to noise-free statevector simulations. Our approach leverages symmetry-aware state preparation and particle-number post-selection to efficiently capture pairing correlations characteristic of systems with same-species nucleons. These findings highlight the viability of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear physics applications and provide a foundation for scaling to more complex nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Spin Polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons from Dissipative Spin Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for spin dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Under the approximation of small polarization, macroscopic spin degrees of freedom decouple from the background, and their evolution equations and transport coefficients have been computed using quantum kinetic theory of massive particles with nonlocal collisions. Employing this theory, we numerically solve dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We explore three interaction scenarios between constituent particles and apply this framework to compute both global and local spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. Our results show that the initially vanishing spin potential relaxes toward thermal vorticity, driving global polarization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sign of longitudinal polarization is sensitive to the interaction type, emphasizing the need for a consistent treatment of dissipative effects in spin hydrodynamics to describe experimental data.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional equation of state extension of quark matter in Fermi-liquid theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cold, dense matter equation of state (EoS) determines crucial global properties of neutron stars (NSs), including the mass, radius and tidal deformability. However, a one-dimensional (1D), cold, and $\beta$-equilibrated EoS is insufficient to fully describe the interactions or capture the dynamical processes of dense matter as realized in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers or core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), where thermal and out-of-equilibrium effects play important roles. We develop a method to self-consistently extend a 1D cold and $\beta$-equilibrated EoS of quark matter to a full three-dimensional (3D) version, accounting for density, temperature, and electron fraction dependencies, within the framework of Fermi-liquid theory (FLT), incorporating both thermal and out-of-equilibrium contributions. We compare our FLT-extended EoS with the original bag model and find that our approach successfully reproduces the contributions of thermal and compositional dependencies of the 3D EoS. Furthermore, we construct a 3D EoS with a first-order phase transition (PT) by matching our 3D FLT-extended quark matter EoS to the hadronic DD2 EoS under Maxwell construction, and test it through the GRHD simulations of the TOV-star and CCSN explosion. Both simulations produce consistent results with previous studies, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our 3D EoS construction with PT.</description>

      <title>Do massive neutrino states really exist?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino physics, while massive states define neutrino masses, the flavor states participating in weak interactions are governed by an off-diagonal mass matrix. This work examines the complete form of this mass matrix, both for a two-flavor toy model and for the general three-flavor case under two distinct mass hierarchies. Using the Monte Carlo method, we estimate the mass matrix parameters and demonstrate how its structure governs the dependence of the interaction cross section on the mass hierarchy (normal vs inverted). This formalism enables the treatment of processes involving neutrino exchange through a non-diagonal propagator, corresponding to a quantum field theory description. Numerical estimates for a local charged-lepton interaction via virtual neutrino exchange yield a ratio of electron-antimuon (lepton flavor violating) to electron-positron cross sections on the order of $10^{-51}$. Furthermore, the cross section exhibits a fundamental dependence on the lightest neutrino mass, which differs drastically between the two hierarchies. For macroscopic processes, this propagator formalism reproduces the standard neutrino oscillation probability by operating directly with the non-diagonal mass matrix, thereby circumventing the wave-packet formalism and confirming the validity of this approach.</description>
