      <title>Bioptic -- A Target-Agnostic Efficacy-Based Small Molecules Search Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent successes in virtual screening have been made possible by large models and extensive chemical libraries. However, combining these elements is challenging: the larger the model, the more expensive it is to run, making ultra-large libraries unfeasible. To address this, we developed a target-agnostic, efficacy-based molecule search model, which allows us to find structurally dissimilar molecules with similar biological activities. We used the best practices to design fast retrieval system, based on processor-optimized SIMD instructions, enabling us to screen the ultra-large 40B Enamine REAL library with 100\% recall rate. We extensively benchmarked our model and several state-of-the-art models for both speed performance and retrieval quality of novel molecules.</description>

      <title>Attention Networks for Personalized Mealtime Insulin Dosing in People with Type 1 Diabetes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating mealtime insulin doses poses a significant challenge for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Doses should perfectly compensate for expected post-meal glucose excursions, requiring a profound understanding of the individual's insulin sensitivity and the meal macronutrients'. Usually, people rely on intuition and experience to develop this understanding. In this work, we demonstrate how a reinforcement learning agent, employing a self-attention encoder network, can effectively mimic and enhance this intuitive process. Trained on 80 virtual subjects from the FDA-approved UVA/Padova T1D adult cohort and tested on twenty, self-attention demonstrates superior performance compared to other network architectures. Results reveal a significant reduction in glycemic risk, from 16.5 to 9.6 in scenarios using sensor-augmented pump and from 9.1 to 6.7 in scenarios using automated insulin delivery. This new paradigm bypasses conventional therapy parameters, offering the potential to simplify treatment and promising improved quality of life and glycemic outcomes for people with T1D.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control of the Neural Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.</description>

      <title>Explainable Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models for Predicting TAS2R-Bitter Molecule Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to develop explainable models to predict the interactions between bitter molecules and TAS2Rs via traditional machine-learning and deep-learning methods starting from experimentally validated data. Bitterness is one of the five basic taste modalities that can be perceived by humans and other mammals. It is mediated by a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), namely taste receptor type 2 (TAS2R) or bitter taste receptors. Furthermore, TAS2Rs participate in numerous functions beyond the gustatory system and have implications for various diseases due to their expression in various extra-oral tissues. For this reason, predicting the specific ligand-TAS2Rs interactions can be useful not only in the field of taste perception but also in the broader context of drug design. Considering that in-vitro screening of potential TAS2R ligands is expensive and time-consuming, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) emerged as powerful tools to assist in the selection of ligands and targets for experimental studies and enhance our understanding of bitter receptor roles. In this context, ML and DL models developed in this work are both characterized by high performance and easy applicability. Furthermore, they can be synergistically integrated to enhance model explainability and facilitate the interpretation of results. Hence, the presented models promote a comprehensive understanding of the molecular characteristics of bitter compounds and the design of novel bitterants tailored to target specific TAS2Rs of interest.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modelling of animal movement with persistent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wild animals are commonly fitted with trackers that record their position through time, to learn about their behaviour. Broadly, statistical models for tracking data often fall into two categories: local models focus on describing small-scale movement decisions, and global models capture large-scale spatial distributions. Due to this dichotomy, it is challenging to describe mathematically how animals' distributions arise from their short-term movement patterns, and to combine data sets collected at different scales. We propose a multiscale model of animal movement and space use based on the underdamped Langevin process, widely used in statistical physics. The model is convenient to describe animal movement for three reasons: it is specified in continuous time (such that its parameters are not dependent on an arbitrary time scale), its speed and direction are autocorrelated (similarly to real animal trajectories), and it has a closed form stationary distribution that we can view as a model of long-term space use. We use the common form of a resource selection function for the stationary distribution, to model the environmental drivers behind the animal's movement decisions. We further increase flexibility by allowing movement parameters to be time-varying, e.g., to account for daily cycles in an animal's activity. We formulate the model as a state-space model and present a method of inference based on the Kalman filter. The approach requires discretising the continuous-time process, and we use simulations to investigate performance for various time resolutions of observation. The approach works well at fine resolutions, though the estimated stationary distribution tends to be too flat when time intervals between observations are very long.</description>

      <title>Predicting Progression Events in Multiple Myeloma from Routine Blood Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to accurately predict disease progression is paramount for optimizing multiple myeloma patient care. This study introduces a hybrid neural network architecture, combining Long Short-Term Memory networks with a Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine, to predict future blood work of affected patients from a series of historical laboratory results. We demonstrate that our model can replicate the statistical moments of the time series ($0.95~\pm~0.01~\geq~R^2~\geq~0.83~\pm~0.03$) and forecast future blood work features with high correlation to actual patient data ($0.92\pm0.02~\geq~r~\geq~0.52~\pm~0.09$). Subsequently, a second Long Short-Term Memory network is employed to detect and annotate disease progression events within the forecasted blood work time series. We show that these annotations enable the prediction of progression events with significant reliability (AUROC$~=~0.88~\pm~0.01$), up to 12 months in advance (AUROC($t+12~$mos)$~=0.65~\pm~0.01$). Our system is designed in a modular fashion, featuring separate entities for forecasting and progression event annotation. This structure not only enhances interpretability but also facilitates the integration of additional modules to perform subsequent operations on the generated outputs. Our approach utilizes a minimal set of routine blood work measurements, which avoids the need for expensive or resource-intensive tests and ensures accessibility of the system in clinical routine. This capability allows for individualized risk assessment and making informed treatment decisions tailored to a patient's unique disease kinetics. The represented approach contributes to the development of a scalable and cost-effective virtual human twin system for optimized healthcare resource utilization and improved patient outcomes in multiple myeloma care.</description>
