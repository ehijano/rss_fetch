      <title>Deep Learning for CMB Foreground Removal and Beam Deconvolution: A U-Net GAN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting cosmological information from microwave sky observations requires accurate estimation of the underlying Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by removing foreground contamination, instrumental noise, and the effects of beam convolution. In this work, we develop a machine learning-based approach
  for CMB reconstruction using a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, where the generator is modeled as a U-Net-based convolutional neural network. To train the network, we generate realistic microwave sky maps by simulating Planck-like observations: scanning HEALPix-simulated skies with real Planck beam profile, actual scan patterns, and anisotropic noise consistent with Planck data. Our method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction, with the difference between the input and recovered maps being less than $2\mu\mathrm{K}$ (approximately $1\%$) outside the Galactic region. Even within the Galactic plane, the reconstruction error remains below $2-3\%$ in most areas, except for a few isolated pixels. Most importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that a GAN-based method can effectively correct for both foreground contamination and the systematic effects of non-circular beams and the asymmetric Planck scan pattern. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for robust and accurate recovery of the CMB signal, even in the presence of strong astrophysical foregrounds and instrumental systematics.</description>

      <title>POKEMON: print optimization for kilo-fiber experiments using micro-optics and nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most pressing problems in modern astrophysics have often required the largest telescopes. With the cost scaling of mirror diameters, the field as a whole is faced with a challenge -- how to replicate or improve on the collecting area and sensitivity of the current generation of ELTs, which already boast 30 m class apertures and are multi-billion dollar facilities. One such approach is being pursued by the Large Fiber Array Spectroscopic Telescope (LFAST) -- a scalable array telescope. Each element of the array will consist of multiple mirrors each feeding to an individual fiber; with those fiber feeds feeding optical and infrared spectrometers. Coupling fiber bundle to spectrometer slit input must be optimized to take full advantage of the photon collecting ability of the telescope array, requiring precise alignment of microlenses to each fiber. Advances in two photon polymerization processes (2PP) now allow for optical quality microlenses with wavefront aberrations as small as $\lambda/20 to be created, opening up the design parameter of bespoke optical design and custom fabricated lenses. We present our approach to tackling these coupling problems with rapid prototyping and detailed quantification of the tolerances of the lenses. Our approach leverages our access to the Nanoscribe GT2 system at Penn State, enabling tests of new optically transparent resins like IPX-Clear to explore multiple design approaches. Our goal is to share our results and enable wider use of these techniques for astronomical applications.</description>

      <title>The evolution of PUCHEROS from a basic to a competitive tool for stellar astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PUCHEROS +, a new spectrograph developed as an enhanced version of PUCHEROS (Pontificia Universidad Catolica High Echelle Resolution Optical Spectrograph), which was the first high-resolution spectrograph built at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (UC). With respect to its predecessor, PUCHEROS + includes a substantial number of improvements, mainly: a new scientific detector, improved objective optics, calibration system, guiding, active thermal control, and remote observing mode. These upgrades convert our early prototype into a much more powerful instrument for science. With a spectral resolution of R = 18000, a spectral range between 400 and 730 nm and an instrument efficiency of about 30 per cent, PUCHEROS + was tested at the ESO (European Southern Observatory) 1.52-m telescope where it has reached a limiting magnitude of about 12 in V band and radial velocity precision of about 30 m/s. The instrument was conceived as a pathfinder for the high-resolution echelle spectrograph PLATOSpec and at the same time, it demonstrates that a compact, relatively low-cost spectrograph can be efficiently employed for long-term monitoring campaigns and as support facility for space missions, in particular if operated remotely at relatively small- or medium-sized telescopes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Capabilities of Astrophotonics for the Precise Alignment of Segmented Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of large telescopes for direct imaging of exoplanets will require segmented primary mirrors. Over both long and short timescales, these telescopes experience segment misalignments which degrade the final science image. Adaptive optics (AO) systems can be used to correct these aberrations in real time. AO systems require wavefront sensors (WFSs) that measure the phase of the incoming light in order to reconstruct optical aberrations. However, most WFSs used for sensing atmospheric turbulence cannot correctly detect aberrations induced by misalignments in segmented telescopes, as they show poor sensitivity to phase discontinuities. We investigate the potential of photonic lanterns (PLs), which are waveguides that allow for the low-loss transmission from multi-mode to multiple single-mode optical signals, for sensing segment misalignments at the focal plane. We assess the ability of PLs to measure piston offsets in segmented mirrors through both simulations and laboratory experiments. We simulate the photonic lantern and demonstrate linear reconstruction on segment pistons. Further, we train a neural network to reconstruct aberrations outside of the linear regime. We experimentally validate reconstruction of segment piston offsets on the Miniature Infrared SEAL (muirSEAL) testbed, which includes a segmented deformable mirror, a PSF imaging branch, and a PL. This work demonstrates the potential of the PL as a compact WFS for future space- and ground-based segmented-mirror telescopes.</description>

      <title>Signal processing and data acquisition system for the BTO detectors onboard COSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy range from a few hundred keV to a few MeV includes important probes such as nuclear gamma-rays and the 511 keV annihilation line. However, compared to X-rays and GeV/TeV gamma-rays, this range suffers from lower sensitivity by orders of magnitude. The upcoming NASA SMEX satellite mission Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI), scheduled for launch in 2027, is expected to break through this limitation with its Compton telescope utilizing a germanium semiconductor detector, covering the 0.2-5 MeV energy range. In addition to the main instrument, two Background and Transient Observer (BTO) detectors will be installed on COSI. The detectors are NaI(Tl) scintillators coupled with SiPMs, and they are being developed as a student collaboration project. BTO aims to 1) measure background radiation in orbit to maximize COSI's sensitivity and 2) detect GRBs and other gamma-ray transients. For this purpose, it is required to cover the lower-energy range from 30 keV to 2 MeV with &lt; 20% FWHM energy resolution. In addition, large signals and afterglow generated by heavy ions penetrating the NaI(Tl) crystal should be appropriately handled. To address these requirements, we have developed a compact signal processing and data acquisition system comprised of two main components: an analog board and a digital board. The analog board amplifies signals from the SiPM, generates triggers, and performs AD conversion. The digital board features a Microchip SAMV71 microcontroller, and we developed the software to control the analog board, read ADC data via SPI interface, add timestamps, and buffer event data. Through this development, we achieved the required wide bandpass and an energy resolution of 10% FWHM at 662 keV with a processing time of 20 us per event. We also implemented veto signal generation for large signals using a discriminator and an onboard detection algorithm for transient events.</description>

      <title>First-principles response simulation of wide-gap CdTe-DSDs for the FOXSI solar sounding rocket experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a wide-gap CdTe double-sided strip detector (CdTe-DSD) for the fourth and fifth flights of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager sounding rocket experiment (FOXSI-4/FOXSI-5). This detector features a 30 um strip width and a variable gap width from 30 um to 70 um, enabling position resolution finer than the strip pitch by inducing charge sharing across adjacent strip electrodes and utilizing this shared energy information for position reconstruction. However, this wide-gap configuration introduces complex detector responses, such as charge loss in the gap regions and electric field distortion near the electrodes, requiring a more advanced modeling approach for interpreting observation results in FOXSI-4/FOXSI-5 and for further optimization of future detector design. To address these complexities, we have constructed a first-principles simulation framework to model the detector response. The simulation integrates Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations of energy deposition, finite element calculations of electric and weighting fields using COMSOL Multiphysics, charge transport modeling incorporating trapping and diffusion, and calculation of the induced charge on the electrodes based on the Shockley-Ramo theorem. By introducing a surface conductive layer, which causes electric field distortion, the model successfully reproduces the experimentally observed charge loss on the cathode side. In addition, the model reproduces the distinct charge sharing behavior on the cathode and anode sides. These results validate the effectiveness of the model in characterizing the wide-gap CdTe-DSD.</description>

      <title>Numerical solutions of the complete two-body system in QUMOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the non-linearity of the QUMOND field equations, in the modelling of binaries so far the two-body system is replaced by an effective one-body system, where the central particle contains the total mass of both binary components and is orbited by a massless test particle. In this work, the discrepancy between the effective one-body treatment and the complete two-body solution in QUMOND is quantified. Particles are treated as limits of Dirac sequences. Then, the QUMOND contribution to the total kinematical acceleration of a particle is expressed as a Green's integral which is calculated numerically. In the non-linear transition regime the kinematical acceleration of the effective one-body system with a total mass of 2 Msun is up to a factor of 1.44 higher than the Newtonian acceleration, whereas the acceleration is only boosted by a factor of 1.2--1.3 in the two-body system in the case of the simple transition function.</description>

      <title>maria goes NIFTy: Gaussian Process-Based Reconstruction and Denoising of Simulated (Sub-)Millimetre Single-Dish Telescope Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Sub-)millimetre single-dish telescopes feature faster mapping speeds and access larger spatial scales than their interferometric counterparts. However, atmospheric fluctuations tend to dominate their signals and complicate recovery of the astronomical sky. Here we develop a framework for Gaussian process-based sky reconstruction and separation of the atmospheric emission from the astronomical signal based on Numerical Information Field Theory (\texttt{NIFTy}). To validate this novel approach, we use the \textit{maria} software to generate synthetic time-ordered observational data mimicking the MUSTANG-2 bolometric array. This approach leads to significantly improved sky reconstructions versus traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Synergy between Roman and PRIMA imaging capabilities for large extragalactic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope will be instrumental for characterizing the physical properties of galaxies and understanding their evolution across time. However, a complete view of galaxy star formation activity will only be possible with the addition of far-infrared observations that a telescope such as PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will be able to provide. Indeed, PRIMA's far-infrared camera will be highly sensitive to dust emission, whereas Roman will probe the stellar emission in rest-frame optical and ultraviolet of distant galaxies. Our aim here is to evaluate the advantage of combining large PRIMA and Roman extragalactic surveys to retrieve the physical properties of galaxies and compare them with what we would obtain using either dataset separately. To do so, we use the Code Investigating Galaxy Emission photometric modeling code to generate a far-ultraviolet to a far-infrared synthetic set of dusty star-forming galaxies at redshifts from 1.5 to 2.5, simulating the observations from the main extragalactic surveys of PRIMA and Roman. We find that the PRIMA + Roman observations can reliably retrieve the star formation rate, stellar masses, and dust luminosity.</description>

      <title>The PRIMA promise of deciphering interstellar dust evolution with observations of the nearby Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a few science cases, using the PRIMA far-IR probe, aimed at achieving several breakthroughs in our understanding of the dust properties and their evolution. We argue that the specific observational capabilities of PRIMA, namely its unprecedented sensitivity over the whole far-IR range and the possibility to obtain continuous spectra between wavelengths 24 and 235 microns, are essential to progress in our understanding of the physics of the interstellar medium and galaxy evolution. Our science cases revolve around observations of nearby galaxies. We discuss the importance of detecting the IR emission of the diffuse interstellar medium of these galaxies, including very low-metallicity systems. We also discuss the opportunity of detecting various solid-state features to understand the mineralogy of interstellar grains. Finally, we stress the unique opportunity brought by the possible simultaneous measures of both the dust continuum and the far-IR fine-structure gas lines. These science cases could be distributed in a few large programs.</description>

      <title>PRIMA: PRIMAger, a far-infrared hyperspectral and polarimetric instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is an infrared observatory for the next decade, currently in Phase A, with a 1.8m telescope actively cooled to 4.5K. On board, an infrared camera, PRIMAger, equipped with ultra-sensitive kinetic inductance detector (KID) arrays, will provide observers with coverage of mid-infrared to far-infrared wavelengths from 24 to 264 microns. PRIMAger will offer two imaging modes: the Hyperspectral mode will cover the 24-84 microns wavelength range with a spectral resolution R=8, while the Polarimetric mode will provide polarimetric imaging in 4 broad bands, from 80 to 264 microns. These observational capabilities have been tailored to answer fundamental astrophysical questions such as black hole and star-formation co-evolution in galaxies, the evolution of small dust grains over a wide range of redshifts, and the effects of interstellar magnetic fields in various environments, as well as to open a vast discovery space with versatile photometric and polarimetric capabilities. PRIMAger is being developed by an international collaboration bringing together French institutes (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille and CEA) through the center National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES, France), the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON, Netherlands), and the Cardiff University (UK) in Europe, as well as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in the USA.</description>

      <title>The Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) for PRIMA: Science Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the science drivers for the Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS), one of two science instrument on the PRobe Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA). FIRESS is designed to meet science objectives in the areas of the origins of planetary atmospheres, the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes, and the buildup of heavy elements in the Universe. In addition to these drivers, FIRESS is envisioned as a versatile far-infrared spectrometer, capable of addressing science questions in most areas of astrophysics and planetary astronomy as part of a dominant General Observer (GO) program with 2/3 of the current science cases using FIRESS. We summarize how the instrument design choices and parameters enable the main science drivers as well as a broad and vibrant GO program.</description>

      <title>Johnson Noise Suppression in AC-Biased Transition-Edge Sensor Bolometers: A Th\'evenin-Equivalent Circuit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers operate under strong electrothermal feedback, wherein power deposited on the bolometer is compensated by a corresponding change in electrical power dissipation. We present a comprehensive analysis of Johnson noise suppression that extends previous theoretical frameworks to the general case of AC-biased linear circuits with arbitrary parasitic impedances. Using a Th\'evenin-equivalent circuit formulation -- consisting of an ideal voltage source and complex series impedance external to the bolometer thermal island -- we derive analytical expressions for the noise-equivalent current in the presence of both bolometer and parasitic Johnson noise sources. Our analysis demonstrates that while the electrothermal feedback loop effectively suppresses Johnson noise originating from the bolometer resistance, it provides no suppression of Johnson noise from external series resistance. In the limit of high loop gain, the bolometer Johnson noise contribution vanishes while the parasitic contribution remains unsuppressed.</description>

      <title>Measuring metal sulfides in interstellar dust with PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur is known to undergo severe depletion when moving from diffuse clouds to the denser regimes of the interstellar medium in molecular clouds. The form in which sulfur gets depleted onto dust grains, however, remains a mystery. One possibility is that sulfur gets locked in interstellar dust in the form of sulfide minerals. Recently, metal sulfides such as NaS and MgS have been detected in a shocked molecular cloud in the Galactic Center, suggesting that these molecules could represent an important reservoir of sulfur in dust grains. In this contribution, we discuss the prospect of observing metal sulfides such as MgS and FeS in absorption experiments carried out with the FIRESS instrument onboard PRIMA using its low resolution observing mode. Our estimates show that the molecular bands of MgS and FeS found between 20 and 50 ${\mu}$m could be detected in absorption with S/N ${\geq}$ 5 for sources brighter than 200 mJy in just 1 h of observing time against low-mass protostellar objects. This science case, therefore, has the potential to unveil the main reservoir of sulfur in interstellar dust, constraining in what form sulfur is incorporated into minor bodies of our solar system.</description>

      <title>Probing the Transient Far-IR Sky with PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time variable far-IR/mm sky is largely unexplored. However, when PRIMA launches, next generation ground-based CMB experiments, including Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will be operating. These will survey large areas of the sky for transient mm sources as a byproduct of their observations, producing regular mm-transient alerts. The results from current experiments show they can detect a wide variety of mm transients ranging from Galactic stars to extragalactic sources associated with AGNs and other energetic phenomena, and moving Solar System objects such as asteroids. These results, and theoretical predictions, indicate that future mm/submm facilities will detect many kinds of transient, including flaring stars, protostars, GRBs, TDEs, neutron star mergers, FBOTs, and SNe. New classes of mm-variable may be uncovered by CMB experiments, and transient searches at other wavelengths, such as the optical LSST survey, will produce additional targets to followup with PRIMA. Predicted rates for extragalactic mm transients to be detected by CMB experiments range from 10s to 1000s of events over the lifetime of these projects. CMB-S4 is most relevant for PRIMA, producing $\sim$100 extragalactic transients per year. Galactic transients and variable sources will also be detected, but the most common Galactic transients, flaring stars, operate on such short timescales that direct follow-up with PRIMA will not be feasible. Variable accretion rates in forming protostars, conversely, produce long term brightness variations that will be ideal monitoring targets. The addition of mid- and far-IR data points for all these sources can determine much about their radiation mechanisms and underlying physics. PRIMA followup of representative examples of various mm-transient and variable sources will thus have a powerful impact on our understanding of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: The South Pole Telescope Shirokoff Line Intensity Mapper (SPT-SLIM) experiment is a pathfinder for demonstrating the use of on-chip spectrometers for millimeter Line Intensity Mapping. We present spectral bandpass measurements of the SLIM spectrometer channels made on site using a Fourier Transform Spectrometer during SPT-SLIMs first deployment the 2024-2025 austral summer observing season. Through this we demonstrate a technique for measuring the narrow band passes of the SPT-SLIM filterbanks that improves beyond the intrinsic resolution of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer.</description>

      <title>FPGA-Based RoCEv2-RDMA Readout Electronics for the CTAO-LST Advanced Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CTAO's (Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory) largest telescopes type, the LST (Large-Sized Telescope), are being installed at the northern site of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on the Canary island of La Palma. Their aim is to capture the lowest-energy gamma rays of the observatory. The hereby proposed readout electronics architecture, serving as a proof-of-concept for its advanced camera upgrade, relies on a custom high-channel count fast sampling hardware digitizer board acting as a Front-End. The design includes a versatile pre-amplification stage and high-speed serial links for streaming JESD204C-compliant data at rates approaching 12 Gb/s per lane. The data get transferred to Back-End electronics for a first data-processing and trigger before being transmitted to event-building servers through 10 Gb/s Ethernet links. The performance of the link is exploited by implementing RDMA communication in hardware, thanks to a RoCEv2 core written in Bluespec SystemVerilog, enabling the possibility of transfer data directly to processing units without CPU intervention. Hardware design and characterization of the Front End board are reported, as well as a detailed description and tests of the Back End RDMA firmware.</description>

      <title>Measurement of dome turbulence intensity from scintillation pattern in the pupil of the telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of optical turbulence (OT) power inside the telescope dome using an instrument registering fluctuations of intensity of a bright star at a plane conjugated to -2 km below the pupil of the telescope - Domecam. The measurements were conducted at the 2.5-m telescope of Caucasian Mountain Observatory of Sternberg Astronomical Institute Lomonosov Moscow State University in period 2022-2024 in different ambient conditions. The instrument was validated against Multi Aperture Scintillation Sensor. Using simultaneous observations with a speckle imager mounted at 2.5-m telescope, we demonstrate that dome OT power measured with Domecam can be converted into delivered image quality (DIQ) assuming von Karman model with outer scale of 0.57 +/- 0.1 m for dome turbulence. Dome turbulence increases median of expected distribution of DIQ for the 2.5-m telescope from 0.90'' to 1.12''.</description>

      <title>The legacy of the IXPE instrument and prospects for the next generation of polarimetric photoelectric X-ray detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging X-ray polarimetry with IXPE has demonstrated the scientific potential of the technique but also revealed the need for significant detector upgrades, particularly with the read-out ASIC that images photoelectron tracks and possibly the multiplication stage. Building on this experience, we are developing a next generation three-dimensional photoelectron track polarimeter based on the GridPix detector, originally developed for axion and axion-like-particle searches. We report on the current status of prototype development and preparations for the ion-irradiation tests. Preliminary proton beam irradiation runs at the Bonn Isochronous Cyclotron facility of the University of Bonn verified both this generation of ASIC's tolerance to high radiation doses present in space and the capability of the cyclotron facility to operate at sufficiently low rates for controlled tests.</description>

      <title>The Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) for PRIMA: Approach and Estimated Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the architectural concept for the Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) for the Probe Mission for far-IR Astrophysics (PRIMA). FIRESS spans the 24--235 micron range with four R ~ 100 slit-fed grating modules, each coupling to a 24 (spatial) by 84 (spectral) pixel array of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). All four arrays are read out simultaneously, and a point source of interest can be coupled to two of the four bands at a time. A Fourier transform module can be engaged over a portion of the FIRESS slits to create a high-resolution mode in which the light is intercepted, processed by the interferometer then reinserted into the path to the grating modules for detection. We provide a simulation and description of the technique that will be used to obtain high-resolution spectra. We identify the most important system requirements imposed by the detector system, finding that they are met with the existing design. Finally, we present our performance modeling, including both direct estimates given our current design status, as well as durable guidelines for developing general-observer programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ProMage, a feed-forward neural network that emulates the computation of observer- and rest-frame magnitudes from the generative galaxy SED package ProSpect. The network predicts magnitudes conditioned on input galaxy physical properties, including redshift, star formation history, gas and dust parameters. ProMage accelerates magnitude computation by a factor of $10^4$ compared to ProSpect, while achieving per-mille relative accuracy for $99\%$ of sources in the test set across the $g,r,i,z,y$ Hyper Suprime-Cam bands. This acceleration is key to enabling fast inference of galaxy physical properties in next-generation Stage IV surveys and to generating large catalogue realisations in forward-modelling frameworks such as GalSBI-SPS.</description>

      <title>J-VAR: the northern variable sky in 7 filters -- First Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. The analysis of variability of astronomical sources is of extraordinary interest, as it allows the study of astrophysical phenomena in real time. This paper presents the Javalambre Variability Survey (J-VAR) which leverages the narrow band filters available at the Javalambre Auxiliary Survey Telescope (JAST80) at the Observatorio Astrof\'isico de Javalambre (OAJ).
  Methods. The JAST80 equipped with T80Cam, providing a field of view of 2\,square degrees and a pixel scale of 0.55\,arcsec/pixel has been designed for wide-field studies. The main characteristic is the availability of a variety of narrow band filters strategically located on stellar spectral features (the $J0395$ in correspondence of the Ca H+K doublet, the $J0515$ of the Mg $b$ triplet, the $J0660$ of the H$\alpha$ line, and the $J0861$ of the Ca~triplet). This project combines, for the first time, the wide-field with a variety of narrow band filters for a unique variability survey, observing each field 11~times with a standardised observing sequence. The median limiting magnitude for individual exposures are 19.1 mag in $J0395$ and $J0515$, $19.6$ mag in $J0660$ and $J0861$, $19.8$ mag in $i$, and $20.2$ in $g$ and $r$. The typical FWHM of the $r$-band images is $1.5$ arcsec.
  Results. This article introduces the first data release of J-VAR including more than 6000 individual asteroids, 10\,detected optical transients (4\,discovered supernovae), and 1.3 million light curves of point-sources. On average, J-VAR delivers an unprecedented $\sim$5000 light curves per square degree of 11\,epochs in 7\,bands, opening research opportunities for theoretical studies and new discoveries alike.</description>

      <title>The ASPIICS solar coronagraph aboard the Proba-3 formation flying mission. Scientific objectives and instrument design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the scientific objectives and instrument design of the ASPIICS coronagraph launched aboard the Proba-3 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) on 5 December 2024. Proba-3 consists of two spacecraft in a highly elliptical orbit around the Earth. One spacecraft carries the telescope, and the external occulter is mounted on the second spacecraft. The two spacecraft fly in a precise formation during 6 hours out of 19.63 hour orbit, together forming a giant solar coronagraph called ASPIICS (Association of Spacecraft for Polarimetric and Imaging Investigation of the Corona of the Sun). Very long distance between the external occulter and the telescope (around 144 m) represents an increase of two orders of magnitude compared to classical externally occulted solar coronagraphs. This allows us to observe the inner corona in eclipse-like conditions, i.e. close to the solar limb (down to 1.099 Rs) and with very low straylight. ASPIICS will provide a new perspective on the inner solar corona that will help solve several outstanding problems in solar physics, such as the origin of the slow solar wind and physical mechanism of coronal mass ejections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aim of incorporating an intercultural perspective into Physics teacher training programs, we ask ourselves which current disciplinary contents could begin to be addressed from this perspective. We started out by exploring the current state of the field exclusively in relation to intercultural science education, focusing on direct relationships with Physics. We present here a synthesis of publications from the past five years that we have found so far. These publications were categorized based on their approach, whether related to theoretical dimensions or to the practical implementation. We develop the following categories: reflections on practical implementation, boundary objects, and practical implementation experiences. We find coincidences that allow us to identify the concept of the celestial sphere as the one that would facilitate the incorporation of an intercultural perspective into Physics teacher training programs.</description>

Abstract: We present a two-stage upgrade to the PySTAMPAS pipeline that boosts the search for long-duration (10 to 10^3 s) transients in gravitational-wave detector data. First, a denoising scheme combines complex 2D wavelet shrinkage with an adaptive pixel threshold to suppress noise while retaining signal power. Second, a KDTree nearest-neighbour algorithm clusters surviving pixels in O(log n) time, replacing the standard clustering approach. Tests with one week of LIGO O3b data show a large reduction in false-alarm rate and up to a factor-of-two improvement in search sensitivity. The computational time is also significantly reduced. These gains extend the sensitivity of all-sky, all-time searches to weaker and shorter transients, enabling rapid and deeper analyses in forthcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observation campaigns.</description>

      <title>Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE): Survey Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the second half of Cycle 1 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we conducted the Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE) program. PASSAGE received the largest allocation of JWST observing time in Cycle 1, 591 hours of NIRISS observations to obtain direct near-IR imaging and slitless spectroscopy. About two thirds of these were ultimately executed, to observe 63 high-latitude fields in Pure Parallel mode. These have provided more than ten thousand near-infrared grism spectrograms of faint galaxies.
  PASSAGE brings unique advantages in studying galaxy evolution: A) Unbiased spectroscopic search, without prior photometric pre-selection. By including the most numerous galaxies, with low masses and strong emission lines, slitless spectroscopy is the indispensable complement to any pre-targeted spectroscopy; B) The combination of several dozen independent fields to overcome cosmic variance; C) Near-infrared spectral coverage, often spanning the full range from 1.0--2.3 $\mu$m, with minimal wavelength gaps, to measure multiple diagnostic rest-frame optical lines, minimizing sensitivity to dust reddening; D) JWST's unprecedented spatial resolution, in some cases using two orthogonal grism orientations, to overcome contamination due to blending of overlapping spectra; E) Discovery of rare bright objects especially for detailed JWST followup. PASSAGE data are public immediately, and our team plans to deliver fully-processed high-level data products.
  In this PASSAGE overview, we describe the survey and data quality, and present examples of these accomplishments in several areas of current interest in the evolution of emission-line galaxy properties, particularly at low masses.</description>

      <title>Improved characterization of the TOI-2141 system: a dense sub-Neptune with non-transiting inner and outer companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to refine the fundamental parameters of the TOI-2141 planetary system, which includes a transiting sub-Neptune orbiting a Sun-like star in a relatively long orbit of 18.26 days, by combining new photometric and spectroscopic observations. We analyze new space-based photometry from TESS and CHEOPS as well as 61 radial velocity measurements from HARPS-N. We perform individual and joint photometric and RV analyses using several modeling tools within a Bayesian model comparison framework. We refine the radius and mass of the transiting planet TOI-2141 b to 3.15 $\pm$ 0.04 $R_\oplus$ and 20.1 $\pm$ 1.6 $M_\oplus$, respectively, five and two times more precise than the previously reported values. Our radial velocity analysis reveals two additional non-transiting companions with orbital periods of 5.46 and 60.45 days. Despite the innermost planet's high geometric transit probability, we find no evidence for transits in the photometric data. The bulk properties of TOI-2141 b suggest a significant volatile envelope atop an Earth-like core, with modeling indicating a hydrogen-rich atmosphere that may have experienced mild photoevaporation over the system's history. Planets b and c must exhibit a modest mutual inclination of at least 2.4 degrees.</description>

      <title>Emulating Global 21 cm Cosmology Observations from the Lunar Far Side to Achieve Quick and Reliable Physical Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efforts are underway to measure the global 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen, which is a powerful probe of the early universe, using NASA radio telescopes on the far side of the Moon. Physics-based models of the signal are computationally expensive to perform Bayesian multi-parameter inferences, for which we have developed novel, publicly-available neural network emulators utilizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ is currently the most accurate emulator in the community by leveraging the signal's temporally-correlated structure, and $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ maintains similar accuracy while training 75 times faster, by learning expressive functional transformations. Each emulator can fit realistic mock signals and obtain unbiased physical parameter constraints, with $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ able to complete end-to-end training and inference in under 30 minutes. The implementation of machine learning tools like these in data analysis pipelines is important to fully exploit upcoming measurements of the cosmological 21 cm signal.</description>

      <title>Sieging HELM's deep: PRIMA unveils the far-infrared properties of highly extincted low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the majority of star-forming galaxies show a tight correlation between stellar mass and dust extinction, recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar population of Highly Extincted Low-Mass (HELM) galaxies, which could revolutionise our understanding of dust production mechanisms. To fully understand the dust content of these galaxies, which are a minority of the overall galaxy population, far-infrared observations over large areas are pivotal. In this paper, we derive the expected PRIMAger, the far-IR (24-235$\mu m$) imaging camera proposed for the Probe far-IR Mission for Astrophysics, fluxes for a set of photometric candidates HELM galaxies. Taking into account a deep survey of 1000h over $1\rm\, deg^{2}$, we expect to detect around $3.1 \times 10^4$ HELM sources in at least one PRIMAger filter, 100 of which are at z=1-1.5. For 32% of this sample, there will be observations in at least four PRIMAger filters, covering at least the 90 to $240\mu m$ wavelength range, which will allow us to obtain a detailed fit of the dust emission and estimate the dust mass.</description>

      <title>Discrete Fourier Transform versus Discrete Chi-Square Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare two time series analysis methods, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM). DCM is designed for detecting many signals superimposed on an unknown trend. The solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM is a simple numerical time series analysis method that performs a massive number of linear least squares fits. We show that our numerical solution for the DCM model fulfills the three conditions of a well-posed problem: existence, uniqueness and stability. The Fisher-test is used to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The correct DCM model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of seven different simulated data samples expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DCM signal and trend detection depend only on the sample size and the accuracy of data. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the time span of observations is irrelevant. We recommend fast sampling of large high quality datasets and the analysis of those datasets using numerical DCM parallel computation Python code.</description>

      <title>Detecting water ice and vapor disks originating from icy planetary bodies around white dwarfs with future PRIMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of atmospheres of polluted white dwarfs provide insights into the elemental composition of accreted exoplanets and exo-asteroids. However, they poorly constrain the abundance of ice-forming volatile elements due to the properties of white dwarf atmospheres. Instead of focusing solely on atmospheric observations, we propose observing circumstellar water ice and vapor disks formed by the tidal disruption of icy bodies using the future PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) far-infrared enhanced survey spectrometer. PRIMA has the potential to measure volatile abundances in colder circumstellar regions inaccessible by shorter-wavelength observations. We employ a simple disk emission model with disk parameter ranges inferred from previous observations and disk evolution simulations. We find the 44-$\mu$m water ice feature promising for observing icy disks. For white dwarfs within 60 pc, 1-hour PRIMA observations could detect water ice with a mass above $10^{20}$ g, representing a potential lower limit of circumstellar disk mass. Water vapor rotational lines also abundantly emerge within the PRIMA wavelength coverage, and 5-hour observations for white dwarfs within 20 pc could detect water vapor with a total disk mass $\gtrsim 10^{20}$ g, depending on the H$_2$/H$_2$O ratio. 19 metal polluted white dwarfs within 20 pc and 210 within 60 pc could be optimal targets for water vapor and ice observations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Mapping Magnetic Fields from Clouds to Cores with PRIMAger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution, wide-area mapping of magnetic field geometries within molecular clouds, and the star-forming filaments and cores within them, is crucial in order to understand the role of magnetic fields in the star formation process. We therefore propose an unbiased survey of star-forming molecular clouds within 0.5 kpc of the Earth in polarized light with the PRIMAger Polarimetry Imager. We will map magnetic fields over entire molecular clouds at linear resolutions of $\sim10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ pc ($\sim10^{3}-10^{4}$ au) in PRIMAger Bands PPI1 - PPI4, thereby resolving magnetic field structure both within individual star-forming filaments and cores, and in the most diffuse regions of molecular clouds. These multi-wavelength polarimetric observations will allow us to systematically investigate both the wide range of open questions about the role of magnetic fields in star formation and the evolution of the interstellar medium, and interstellar dust grain properties. The time required to map the area observed by the \textit{Herschel} Gould Belt Survey (160 deg$^{2}$) to the cirrus confusion limit in polarized light is 170 hours. This will give a 5-$\sigma$ detection of 20% polarized low-density cirrus emission, with surface brightnesses in polarized intensity of 1.0-2.4\,MJy/sr across the PRIMAger bands, and will ensure detection of polarized emission at all higher column densities. This time estimate can be simply scaled up in order to map magnetic fields in a larger sample of molecular clouds, including more distant regions of higher-mass star formation.</description>

Abstract: Studies of the water content and isotopic composition of water-rich asteroids and comets are of key interest for understanding the late accretion stage of the Solar System cometary and chondritic materials. The PRobe far-infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) can make an important contribution to solving this long-standing problem by carrying out direct measurements of the D/H ratio in a significant sample of Oort cloud and Kuiper belt comets, sampling the isotopic composition of the present-day outer Solar System. This would allow comparisons between different comet reservoirs, and with inner Solar System measurements in meteorites, as well as searching for correlations with physical parameters, such as hyperactivity, providing quantitative constraints on the dynamical and chemical models of the early Solar System.</description>

      <title>Searching for missing interstellar oxygen in the far-infrared</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Study of interstellar elemental depletion poses an important problem in the interstellar matter that at least a quarter of the total oxygen ($\sim 160$ ppm relative to hydrogen) is not accounted for in any known form of oxygen in the translucent or dense interstellar medium (ISM). Detailed analysis of the absorption feature of water ice at 3 $\mu$m suggests that one fifth of the missing oxygen may reside in 3 $\mu$m-sized water ice grains. However, the 3 $\mu$m feature becomes complex and weak for grains larger than 3 $\mu$m, and thus the NIR spectroscopy is not the best means to study the presence of large ice grains reliably. Here we show that sensitive observations of the far-infrared (FIR) features of water ice at 44 and 62 $\mu$m enable us to constrain the amount of crystalline water ice grains up to 5 $\mu$m or even larger sizes unambiguously. Oxygen is one of the key elements in the ISM chemistry, and [O I] 63 $\mu$m is a dominant cooling line in the neutral ISM. Understanding the actual form of the missing oxygen in the ISM is crucial for the study of the ISM and star-formation process. To detect the FIR features of the crystalline water ice over the expected strong continuum, a sensitive FIR spectrograph represented by PRIMA/FIRESS is indispensable. Since the feature is broad, the low spectral resolution of $R \sim 130$ is sufficient, but accurate relative calibration better than 1% is required.</description>

      <title>Far-infrared probing with PRIMA into particle acceleration associated with relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is presented that the Probe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) has a high potential to study particle acceleration phenomena associated with jets emanating from active galactic nuclei. A special focus is put on hot spots of radio galaxies because they are widely regarded as the jet-terminal shock where particles are accelerated via the diffusive shock acceleration. To investigate the particle acceleration condition in the hot spots, it is of prime importance to evaluate their magnetic field strength. As a useful indicator of the magnetic field, we propose to adopt a synchrotron spectral feature called the cooling break, of which the frequency is determined by the mutual balance between the synchrotron radiative cooling and the adiabatic one. Referring to the standard physical parameter of the hot spots, the cooling break is expected to reside in or slightly below the far-infrared range covered with PRIMA. The feasibility of the PRIMA observations to measure the far-infrared flux density and to constrain their cooling break frequency is discussed for nearby well-studied hot spots. An affordable observational strategy with PRIMA is described. A possible application of the method to lobes of radio galaxies is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>One latent to fit them all: a unified representation of baryonic feedback on matter distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and parsimonious quantification of baryonic feedback on matter distribution is of crucial importance for understanding both cosmology and galaxy formation from observational data. This is, however, challenging given the large discrepancy among different models of galaxy formation simulations, and their distinct subgrid physics parameterizations. Using 5,072 simulations from 4 different models covering broad ranges in their parameter spaces, we find a unified 2D latent representation. Compared to the simulations and other phenomenological models, our representation is independent of both time and cosmology, much lower-dimensional, and disentangled in its impacts on the matter power spectra. The common latent space facilitates the comparison of parameter spaces of different models and is readily interpretable by correlation with each. The two latent dimensions provide a complementary representation of baryonic effects, linking black hole and supernova feedback to distinct and interpretable impacts on the matter power spectrum. Our approach enables developing robust and economical analytic models for optimal gain of physical information from data, and is generalizable to other fields with significant modeling uncertainty.</description>

      <title>ALMA High-resolution Observation for the Transitional Disk around IRAS 04125+2902</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the youngest transiting planet was discovered around the T Tauri star, IRAS 04125+2902, in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. This system is crucial for understanding the early stages of planet formation. We used Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 data to investigate the IRAS 04125+2902 system in detail. The dust continuum emission reveals a ring-gap transitional disk structure with an inclination of 35.6$^{\circ}$. In addition, two-dimensional super-resolution imaging based on Sparse Modeling and the one-dimensional modeling of disk brightness distribution suggest the existence of an inner emission, which may be attributed to an inner disk, although free-free emission from the central star is not ruled out. Furthermore, we identified the $^{12}$CO $J$=2-1 emission, and the dynamical mass of the central star is estimated to be 0.7-1.0 $M_{\odot}$. The asymmetry of the dust ring and the velocity distortion around the central star are, if at all, weak, suggesting that the inner disk, if it exists, is not highly inclined with respect to the outer disk. Radiative transfer calculations of dust continuum emission suggest that the inner and the outer disk may be misaligned by $\sim$10$^\circ$, which may be confirmed in future observations with higher resolution and sensitivity. Our results suggest that IRAS 04125+2902 is a dynamically complex system, where the binary orbit, outer disk, inner disk, and planetary orbit are mutually misaligned, providing insight into the early orbital evolution of young systems.</description>

      <title>Need for PRIMA to understand the nature and ISM physical conditions of HST-dark galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main open issues in galaxy formation and evolution is the early assembly of the most massive galaxies and their contribution to the stellar mass and star formation rate densities at early epochs. Massive red sources already in place at z &gt; 2 to 3 have been found in deep Spitzer-IRAC and ALMA surveys. They are often called optically and near-IR dark, or HST-dark, being undetected even in the deepest HST frames. The submillimeter (i.e., ALMA) detection of these sources confirms their high-z dusty nature: they are massive (e.g., log(M*/Msun) &gt; 10) and dusty star-forming galaxies with estimated redshifts in the 2.5 to 7 range. They seem to lie mostly below the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies and show gas depletion times &lt;1 Gyr. Imaging with the PRIMA/PRIMAger instrument over the full 25 to 265 micron range will allow us to characterize their still uncovered spectral energy distributions between JWST and ALMA spectral windows, probing their dust content and properties (e.g., temperature, mass), whereas spectroscopic observations with FIRESS will be the key to investigate the nature of their powering source (e.g., AGN or star formation) and to study the physics of their ISM, by detecting and measuring fine structure lines in the mid- and far-IR domain.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Target Lines from Interlopers and Continuum with Neural Networks: A SPHEREx Intensity Mapping Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) traces the large-scale distribution of matter by measuring fluctuations in aggregate line emission from unresolved galaxies and the intergalactic medium, providing a powerful probe of both astrophysics and cosmology. However, interpreting LIM data is limited by our ability to disentangle the signal of a target spectral line from continuum emission and interloper lines, which are emissions from other redshifts that fall within the observed frequency band. Astrophysical modeling uncertainties further complicate matters, leaving the relative amplitudes of the map components poorly understood. In this paper, we present a neural-network (NN) approach to separate the three map components at the level of the angular power spectrum, explicitly accounting for uncertainties in their relative amplitudes. As test cases, we generate SPHEREx-like maps with variable interloper line luminosities across multiple frequency channels, with and without pixel-wise scatter and continuum contributions. We find that cross-channel correlations are essential for robust NN performance when scatter is present. The NN exhibits a hierarchy in residual errors: brighter components yield smaller residuals, and the dimmest the highest. Without continuum emission, the network recovers the target power spectrum to within $2.5\%$, while partially correcting the interloper spectra. With continuum included, the NN accurately reconstructs the power spectra of the continuum and target line, within $2\%$ and $6\%$, respectively, but fails to recover those of the interlopers. Reducing pixel-level scatter further improves performance, lowering residual errors to $1\%$ (continuum) and $3\%$ (target line).</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Far-Infrared Polarimetry Approach Envisioned for the PRIMA Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in the study of magnetic fields and the properties of interstellar dust, explored through increasingly capable far-IR/submillimeter polarimetry, along with maturing detector technology, have set the stage for a transformative leap in polarization mapping capability using a cryogenic space telescope. We describe the approach pursued by the proposed Probe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) to make ultra-deep maps of intensity and polarization in four bands in the 91-232 micron range. A simple, polarimetry-optimized PRIMA Polarimetric Imager (PPI) is designed for this purpose, consisting of arrays of single-polarization Kinetic Inductance Detectors oriented with three angles which allow measurement of Stokes I, Q, and U in single scans. In this study, we develop an end-to-end observation simulator to perform a realistic test of the approach for the case of mapping a nearby galaxy. The observations take advantage of a beam-steering mirror to perform efficient, two-dimensional, crossing scans. Map making is based on 'destriping' approaches demonstrated for Herschel/SPIRE and Planck. Taking worst-case assumptions for detector sensitivity including 1/f noise, we find excellent recovery of simulated input astrophysical maps, with I, Q, and U detected at near fundamental limits. We describe how PPI performs detector relative calibration and mitigates the key systematic effects to accomplish PRIMA polarization science goals.</description>

      <title>A Morphological Model to Separate Resolved-Unresolved Sources in the DESI Legacy Surveys: Application in the LS4 Alert Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Separating resolved and unresolved sources in large imaging surveys is a fundamental step to enable downstream science, such as searching for extragalactic transients in wide-field time-domain surveys. Here we present our method to effectively separate point sources from the resolved, extended sources in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Surveys (LS). We develop a supervised machine-learning model based on the Gradient Boosting algorithm $\texttt{XGBoost}$. The features input to the model are purely morphological and are derived from the tabulated LS data products. We train the model using $\sim$$2\times10^5$ LS sources in the COSMOS field with HST morphological labels and evaluate the model performance on LS sources with spectroscopic classification from the DESI Data Release 1 ($\sim$$2\times10^7$ objects) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 ($\sim$$3\times10^6$ objects), as well as on $\sim$$2\times10^8$ Gaia stars. A significant fraction of LS sources are not observed in every LS filter, and we therefore build a ''Hybrid'' model as a linear combination of two \texttt{XGBoost} models, each containing features combining aperture flux measurements from the ''blue'' ($gr$) and ''red'' ($iz$) filters. The Hybrid model shows a reasonable balance between sensitivity and robustness, and achieves higher accuracy and flexibility compared to the LS morphological typing. With the Hybrid model, we provide classification scores for $\sim$$3\times10^9$ LS sources, making this the largest ever machine-learning catalog separating resolved and unresolved sources. The catalog has been incorporated into the real-time pipeline of the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (LS4), enabling the identification of extragalactic transients within the LS4 alert stream.</description>

Abstract: We present new color transformations between select near-infrared filters on JWST/NIRCam, Euclid/NISP, Roman/WFI, HST, and ground-based $izY+IJHK_S$, for a total of 105 unique filter combinations. Additionally, we apply these transformations to predict the color-magnitude relation of the tip of the red giant branch as seen with JWST, Euclid, and Roman based on theoretical results for HST and 2MASS filters; for JWST we find good agreement with empirical results in the literature. We also find typical residual dispersion around these transformations of 0.01 mag for Cepheid and RR Lyrae variables and RGB stars, but up to 0.1 mag for O- and C-rich TP-AGB stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRANDProto300 (GP300) is a prototype array of the GRAND experiment, designed to validate the technique of autonomous radio-detection of astroparticles by detecting cosmic rays with energies between 10$^{17}$-10$^{18.5}$ eV. This observation will further enable the study of the Galactic-to-extragalactic source transition region. Between November 2024 u to May 2025, 46 out of 300 antennas have been operational and collecting data stably. We present here our cosmic-ray search pipeline, which involves several filtering steps: (1) coincidence search for signals triggering multiple antennas within a time window, (2) directional reconstruction of events, (3) exclusion of clustered (in time and space) noise events, (4) polarization cut, (5) selection based on the size of the footprint, and (6) other less mature cuts in this preliminary stage, including visual cuts. The efficiency of the pipeline is evaluated and applied to the first batch of data, yielding a set of cosmic-ray candidate events, which we present.</description>

      <title>SO2, silicate clouds, but no CH4 detected in a warm Neptune</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: WASP-107b is a warm (~740 K) transiting planet with a Neptune-like mass of ~30.5 Earth masses and Jupiter-like radius of ~0.94 Jupiter radius, whose extended atmosphere is eroding. Previous observations showed evidence for water vapour and a thick high-altitude condensate layer in WASP-107b's atmosphere. Recently, photochemically produced sulphur dioxide (SO2) was detected in the atmosphere of a hot (~1200 K) Saturn-mass planet from transmission spectroscopy near 4.05 microns, but for temperatures below 1000 K sulphur is predicted to preferably form sulphur allotropes instead of SO2. Here we report the 9-sigma detection of two fundamental vibration bands of SO2, at 7.35 microns and 8.69 microns, in the transmission spectrum of WASP-107b using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of the JWST. This discovery establishes WASP-107b as the second irradiated exoplanet with confirmed photochemistry, extending the temperature range of exoplanets exhibiting detected photochemistry from ~1200 K down to ~740 K. Additionally, our spectral analysis reveals the presence of silicate clouds, which are strongly favoured (~7-sigma) over simpler cloud setups. Furthermore, water is detected (~12-sigma), but methane is not. These findings provide evidence of disequilibrium chemistry and indicate a dynamically active atmosphere with a super-solar metallicity.</description>

Abstract: The Einstein Telescope faces a critical data analysis challenge with correlated noise, often overlooked in current parameter estimation analyses. We address this issue by presenting the statistical formulation of the likelihood that includes correlated noise for the Einstein Telescope or any detector network. By considering varying degrees of correlation, we probe the impact of noise correlations on the parameter estimation analysis of a GW150914-like event. We show that neglecting these correlations may significantly reduce the accuracy of the chirp mass reconstruction. This emphasizes how critical a proper treatment of correlated noise is, as presented in this work, to unlocking the wealth of results promised by the Einstein Telescope.</description>

Abstract: With the number of supernovae observed expected to drastically increase thanks to large-scale surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), it is necessary that the tools we use to classify these objects keep up with this increase. We previously created Supernova Tagging and Classification (STag) to address this problem by employing machine learning techniques alongside logistic regression in order to assign 'tags' to spectra based on spectral features. STag II is a continuation of this work, which now makes use of model supernova spectra combined with real DESI spectra in order to train STag to better deal with realistic data. We also make use of the rlap score as a trustworthiness cut, making for a more robust and accurate supernova classifier than before.</description>

      <title>A novel metric for assessing climatological surface habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planetary surface habitability has so far been considered, in the main, upon a global scale. The increasing number of 3D modelling studies of (exo)planetary climate has highlighted the need for a more nuanced understanding of surface habitability. Using satellite-derived data of photosynthetic life to represent the observed surface habitability of modern Earth, we validate a set of climatologically-defined metrics previously used in habitability studies. The comparison finds that the metrics defined by surface temperature alone show spatial patterns of habitability distinct to those defined by aridity or water availability, with no metric able to completely replicate the observed habitability. We build upon these results to introduce a new metric defined by the observed thermal limits of modern Earth-based life, along with surface water fluxes as an analogue for water and nutrient availability. Furthermore, we pay attention to not only the thermal bounds of macroscopic complex life, but additionally the limits of microbial life which have been vital to the generation of Earth's biosignatures, thus expanding considerations of climatic habitability out of a historically binary definition. Repeating the validation for our metric, along with another which uses a similar definition that incorporates conditions for both temperature and water availability, shows a significant improvement in capturing the broad patterns of surface habitability, laying the groundwork for more comprehensive assessments of potential life-supporting climates upon other planets.</description>

      <title>ARCANE -- Early Detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model, previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW) data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection pipeline achieves an F1-Score of 0.37, with an average detection delay of 24.5% of the event's duration while processing only a minimal portion of the event data. As more data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework to Follow-up Continuous Gravitational Wave Candidates from Deep Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18204</link>

Abstract: Broad all-sky searches for continuous gravitational waves have high computational costs and require hierarchical pipelines. The sensitivity of these approaches is set by the initial search and by the number of candidates from that stage that can be followed-up. The current follow-up schemes for the deepest surveys require careful tuning and set-up, have a significant human-labor cost and this impacts the number of follow-ups that can be afforded. Here we present and demonstrate a new follow-up framework based on Bayesian parameter estimation for the rapid, highly automated follow-up of candidates produced by the early stages of deep, wide-parameter space searches for continuous waves.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Modeling Orbital Decay of Low-Earth Orbit Satellites due to Atmospheric Drag: A Simplified Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are crucial for communications, navigation, and Earth observation. However, their operational lifetimes are strongly influenced by orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. This work presents a simplified analytical model of orbital decay in LEO, incorporating atmospheric density variations and satellite parameters. Using standard drag force equations and density models, we explore how altitude, satellite mass, and cross-sectional area affect decay timescales. Comparisons are made with existing NASA models and previous literature. The results highlight the importance of accurate atmospheric density representation and solar activity in predicting satellite lifetimes, especially relevant in the context of increasing space debris and mega-constellations.</description>
