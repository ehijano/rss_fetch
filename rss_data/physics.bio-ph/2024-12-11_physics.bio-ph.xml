      <title>Quasi-stationary evolution of cubic-quintic NLSE drop-like solitons in DNA-protein systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear molecular excitations in DNA have traditionally been modelled using the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE). An alternative approach is based on the generalized plane-base rotator model and the SU(2)/U(1) generalized spin coherent states, which leads to a cubic quintic NLSE. The higher-order nonlinearities are particularly useful for modelling complex interactions, such as those in DNA-protein systems, where multiple competing forces play a significant role. Additionally, the surrounding viscous medium introduces dissipative forces that affect the propagation of molecular excitations, leading to energy dissipation and damping effects. These damping effects are modelled using the quasi-stationary method, which describes the system's near-equilibrium behaviour. In this work, we explore the evolution of nonlinear molecular excitations in DNA-protein systems, accounting for damping effects, and discuss potential applications to the transcription process.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Dynamic Models Hybridisation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based dynamic models (PBDMs) are simplified representations of complex dynamical systems. PBDMs take specific processes within a complex system and assign a fragment of variables and an accompanying set of parameters to depict the processes. As this often leads to suboptimal parameterisation of the system, a key challenge requires refining the empirical parameters and variables to reduce uncertainties while maintaining the model s explainability and enhancing its predictive accuracy. We demonstrate that a hybrid mosquito population dynamics model, which integrates a PBDM with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), retains the explainability of the PBDM by incorporating the PINN-learned model parameters in place of its empirical counterparts. Specifically, we address the limitations of traditional PBDMs by modelling the parameters of larva and pupa development rates using a PINN that encodes complex, learned interactions of air temperature, precipitation and humidity. Our results demonstrate improved mosquito population simulations including the difficult-to-predict mosquito population peaks. This opens the possibility of hybridisation concept application on other complex systems based on PBDMs such as cancer growth to address the challenges posed by scarce and noisy data, and to numerical weather prediction and climate modelling to overcome the gap between physics-based and data-driven weather prediction models.</description>

      <title>Correlation-weighted 23Na magnetic resonance fingerprinting in the brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a new sodium magnetic resonance fingerprinting ($^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF) method for the simultaneous mapping of $\text{T}_\text{1}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,long}^{*}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,short}^{*}$ and sodium density with built-in $\Delta\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ (radiofrequency transmission inhomogeneities) and $\Delta\text{f}_\text{0}$ corrections (frequency offsets). We based our $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF implementation on a 3D FLORET sequence with 23 radiofrequency pulses. To capture the complex spin ${\frac{\text{3}}{\text{2}}}$ dynamics of the $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ nucleus, the fingerprint dictionary was simulated using the irreducible spherical tensor operators formalism. The dictionary contained 831,512 entries covering a wide range of $\text{T}_\text{1}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,long}^{*}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,short}^{*}$, $\Delta\text{B}_\text{1}^{+}$ factor and $\Delta\text{f}_\text{0}$ parameters. Fingerprint matching was performed using the Pearson correlation and the resulting relaxation maps were weighted with a subset of the highest correlation coefficients corresponding to signal matches for each voxel. Our $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF method was compared against reference methods in a 7-compartment phantom, and applied in brain in five healthy volunteers at 7 T. In phantoms, $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF produced values comparable to those obtained with reference methods. Average sodium relaxation time values in cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and white matter across five healthy volunteers were in good agreement with values previously reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Mamba state-space model for anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing anomalous diffusion is crucial in order to understand the evolution of complex stochastic systems, from molecular interactions to cellular dynamics. In this work, we characterize the performances regarding such a task of Bi-Mamba, a novel state-space deep-learning architecture articulated with a bidirectional scan mechanism. Our implementation is tested on the AnDi-2 challenge datasets among others. Designed for regression tasks, the Bi-Mamba architecture infers efficiently the effective diffusion coefficient and anomalous exponent from single, short trajectories. As such, our results indicate the potential practical use of the Bi-Mamba architecture for anomalousdiffusion characterization.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method for lipid membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method and numerical implementation for curved and deforming lipid membranes is presented here. The membrane surface is endowed with a mesh whose in-plane motion need not depend on the in-plane flow of lipids. Instead, in-plane mesh dynamics can be specified arbitrarily. A new class of mesh motions is introduced, where the mesh velocity satisfies the dynamical equations of a user-specified two-dimensional material. A Lagrange multiplier constrains the out-of-plane membrane and mesh velocities to be equal, such that the mesh and material always overlap. An associated numerical inf--sup instability ensues, and is removed by adapting established techniques in the finite element analysis of fluids. In our implementation, the aforementioned Lagrange multiplier is projected onto a discontinuous space of piecewise linear functions. The new mesh motion is compared to established Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations by investigating a preeminent numerical benchmark of biological significance: the pulling of a membrane tether from a flat patch, and its subsequent lateral translation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a slender filament beating in a viscous fluid with novel curvature-dependent bending stiffness. Our numerical and experimental investigations reveal that such differential stiffness can sustain planar bending waves far along flexible filaments, in stark contrast to the uniform-stiffness case which requires more sophisticated control. In particular, we establish basal actuation as a viable, parsimonious mechanism for generating high-amplitude planar bending waves. Moreover, the resulting beat patterns closely resemble the power-and-recovery strokes of propulsive biological filaments such as cilia, suggesting extensive applications in robotic and engineered systems.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins with high-fidelity reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating large proteins using traditional molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally demanding. To address this challenge, we propose a novel tree-structured coarse-grained model that efficiently captures protein dynamics. By leveraging a hierarchical protein representation, our model accurately reconstructs high-resolution protein structures, with sub-angstrom precision achieved for a 168-amino acid protein. We combine this coarse-grained model with a deep learning framework based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A neural network is trained to model the drift force, while a RealNVP-based noise generator approximates the stochastic component. This approach enables a significant speedup of over 20,000 times compared to traditional MD, allowing for the generation of microsecond-long trajectories within a few minutes and providing valuable insights into protein behavior. Our method demonstrates high accuracy, achieving sub-angstrom reconstruction for short (25 ns) trajectories and maintaining statistical consistency across multiple independent simulations.</description>

      <title>Doob's Lagrangian: A Sample-Efficient Variational Approach to Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07974v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's h-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</description>
