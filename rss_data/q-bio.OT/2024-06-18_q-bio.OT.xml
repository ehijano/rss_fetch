      <title>Metabolic allometric scaling of multicellular organisms as a product of evolutionary development and optimization of food chains</title>

Abstract: Production of energy is a foundation of life. Metabolic rate of organisms (amount of energy produced per unit time) generally increases slower than organisms' mass. This phenomenon, when considered across different taxa, is called interspecific allometric scaling. Its origin puzzles scientists for ninety two years. Here, we introduce a general biomechanical model, and apply it to modelling dynamic and kinematic properties of motion of mammals, reptiles, fish and birds. We consider these models from the perspective of food chain composition, and use them for finding metabolic properties. Food chains are viewed as entities developing in the process of evolution under the forces of natural selection, and optimized from the perspective of sharing common resources of a food chain's habitat among species composing food chains. This optimized sharing of resources occurs in a way that gives all species sufficient quantity of resources to reproduce in adequate quantities, thus preserving the continuity of a food chain, while also serving as a consumed resource for the rest of a food chain. In this selection and optimization process, a metabolic allometric exponent represents a quantitative measure of thus evolutionary found balanced state of sharing of common resources. This optimized sharing provides an optimal, albeit dynamic, stability of a food chain in time and space for a given habitat. Certainly, such selection is framed by physical, physiological, environmental constraints. The comparison of theoretically calculated values of metabolic allometric exponents with available experimental data for the maximal and basal metabolic rates showed: (a) high adequacy of proposed model to real phenomenon; (b) strong indication that the discovered mechanism of formation of food chains on principles of natural selection and optimization is a real cause of metabolic allometric scaling.</description>

      <title>Metabolic allometric scaling of unicellular organisms as a product of selection and optimization of nutrient distribution in food chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04695</link>

Abstract: One of the major characteristics of living organisms is metabolic rate - amount of energy produced per unit time. When the size of organisms increases, the metabolic rate also increases in a certain regular way. This regularity, whose causes are considered unknown, is what puzzles researchers for many decades. The effect is called metabolic allometric scaling. It has important implications for the individual and population organismal development. Here, we study the causes of this phenomenon for unicellular organisms considering metabolic properties of Amoeba Proteus, fission yeast S. pombe, E. coli, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus. We found that the metabolic properties of unicellular organisms are defined by natural selection, acting within the food chain, composed of microorganisms sharing nutritional resources within the common habitat. This sharing of resources is optimized in such a way that bigger microorganisms have progressively bigger nutrient influx per unit of surface. Such an evolutionary arrangement provides metabolic advantage, which bigger organisms need in order to support their metabolic requirements. On the other hand, this advantage cannot be too strong, since this could lead to destruction of smaller species, bigger organisms feed on or compete with for nutrients within the food chain. Accounting for this regular increase of nutrient influx with mass increase, we obtained allometric exponents and their range close to experimental values. These findings supports an argument that the metabolic properties of unicellular organisms are formed by natural selection in a way that preserves a dynamic balance in sharing resources between populations of different species within the food chain, while quantitatively this selection and optimization manifest as a regular increase of nutrient influx per unit surface, when mass of unicellular organisms increases.</description>

      <title>The Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS-METS) Challenge 2023: Brain Metastasis Segmentation on Pre-treatment MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00838</link>

Abstract: The translation of AI-generated brain metastases (BM) segmentation into clinical practice relies heavily on diverse, high-quality annotated medical imaging datasets. The BraTS-METS 2023 challenge has gained momentum for testing and benchmarking algorithms using rigorously annotated internationally compiled real-world datasets. This study presents the results of the segmentation challenge and characterizes the challenging cases that impacted the performance of the winning algorithms. Untreated brain metastases on standard anatomic MRI sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR, T1PG) from eight contributed international datasets were annotated in stepwise method: published UNET algorithms, student, neuroradiologist, final approver neuroradiologist. Segmentations were ranked based on lesion-wise Dice and Hausdorff distance (HD95) scores. False positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) were rigorously penalized, receiving a score of 0 for Dice and a fixed penalty of 374 for HD95. Eight datasets comprising 1303 studies were annotated, with 402 studies (3076 lesions) released on Synapse as publicly available datasets to challenge competitors. Additionally, 31 studies (139 lesions) were held out for validation, and 59 studies (218 lesions) were used for testing. Segmentation accuracy was measured as rank across subjects, with the winning team achieving a LesionWise mean score of 7.9. Common errors among the leading teams included false negatives for small lesions and misregistration of masks in space.The BraTS-METS 2023 challenge successfully curated well-annotated, diverse datasets and identified common errors, facilitating the translation of BM segmentation across varied clinical environments and providing personalized volumetric reports to patients undergoing BM treatment.</description>

      <title>Identification of spatial dynamic patterns of behavior using weighted Voronoi diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes an innovative approach to analyze spatial patterns of behavior by integrating information in weighted Voronoi diagrams. The objective of the research is to analyze the temporal distribution of an experimental subject in different regions of a given space, with the aim of identifying significant areas of interest. The methodology employed involves dividing the experimental space, determining representative points, and assigning weights based on the cumulative time the subject spends in each region. This process results in a set of generator points along with their respective weights, thus defining the Voronoi diagram. The study also presents a detailed and advanced perspective for understanding spatial behavioral patterns in experimental contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On December 15, 2023, The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) released a report entitled: Foundational Research Gaps and Future Directions for Digital Twins. The ostensible purpose of this report was to bring some structure to the burgeoning field of digital twins by providing a working definition and a series of research challenges that need to be addressed to allow this technology to fulfill its full potential. In the work presented herein we focus on five specific findings from the NASEM Report: 1) definition of a Digital Twin, 2) using fit-for-purpose guidance, 3) developing novel approaches to Verification, Validation and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) of Digital Twins, 4) incorporating control as an explicit purpose for a Digital Twin and 5) using a Digital Twin to guide data collection and sensor development, and describe how these findings are addressed through the design specifications for a Critical Illness Digital Twin (CIDT) aimed at curing sepsis.</description>
