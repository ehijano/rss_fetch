      <title>MarketGANs: Multivariate financial time-series data augmentation using generative adversarial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces MarketGAN, a factor-based generative framework for high-dimensional asset return generation under severe data scarcity. We embed an explicit asset-pricing factor structure as an economic inductive bias and generate returns as a single joint vector, thereby preserving cross-sectional dependence and tail co-movement alongside inter-temporal dynamics. MarketGAN employs generative adversarial learning with a temporal convolutional network (TCN) backbone, which models stochastic, time-varying factor loadings and volatilities and captures long-range temporal dependence. Using daily returns of large U.S. equities, we find that MarketGAN more closely matches empirical stylized facts of asset returns, including heavy-tailed marginal distributions, volatility clustering, leverage effects, and, most notably, high-dimensional cross-sectional correlation structures and tail co-movement across assets, than conventional factor-model-based bootstrap approaches. In portfolio applications, covariance estimates derived from MarketGAN-generated samples outperform those derived from other methods when factor information is at least weakly informative, demonstrating tangible economic value.</description>

      <title>Momentum-integrated Multi-task Stock Recommendation with Converge-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stock recommendation is critical in Fintech applications, which leverage price series and alternative information to estimate future stock performance. Traditional time-series forecasting training often fails to capture stock trends and rankings simultaneously, which are essential factors for investors. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework for stock recommendation, \textbf{M}omentum-\textbf{i}ntegrated \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{Stoc}k \textbf{R}ecommendation with Converge-based Optimization (\textbf{MiM-StocR}). To improve the model's ability to capture short-term trends, we incorporate a momentum line indicator in model training. To prioritize top-performing stocks and optimize investment allocation, we propose a listwise ranking loss function called Adaptive-k ApproxNDCG. Moreover, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock market, existing MTL frameworks face overfitting issues when applied to stock time series. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Converge-based Quad-Balancing (CQB) method. We conducted extensive experiments on three stock benchmarks: SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300. MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art MTL baselines across both ranking and profitability evaluations.</description>

      <title>Modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9 within a multistate regression framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lifetime behaviour of loans is notoriously difficult to model, which can compromise a bank's financial reserves against future losses, if modelled poorly. Therefore, we present a data-driven comparative study amongst three techniques in modelling a series of default risk estimates over the lifetime of each loan, i.e., its term-structure. The behaviour of loans can be described using a nonstationary and time-dependent semi-Markov model, though we model its elements using a multistate regression-based approach. As such, the transition probabilities are explicitly modelled as a function of a rich set of input variables, including macroeconomic and loan-level inputs. Our modelling techniques are deliberately chosen in ascending order of complexity: 1) a Markov chain; 2) beta regression; and 3) multinomial logistic regression. Using residential mortgage data, our results show that each successive model outperforms the previous, likely as a result of greater sophistication. This finding required devising a novel suite of simple model diagnostics, which can itself be reused in assessing sampling representativeness and the performance of other modelling techniques. These contributions surely advance the current practice within banking when conducting multistate modelling. Consequently, we believe that the estimation of loss reserves will be more timeous and accurate under IFRS 9.</description>
