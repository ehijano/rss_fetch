      <title>Asymptotics of Random Feature Regression Beyond the Linear Scaling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have been achieved by using overparametrized models trained until near interpolation of the training data. It was shown, e.g., through the double descent phenomenon, that the number of parameters is a poor proxy for the model complexity and generalization capabilities. This leaves open the question of understanding the impact of parametrization on the performance of these models. How does model complexity and generalization depend on the number of parameters $p$? How should we choose $p$ relative to the sample size $n$ to achieve optimal test error?
  In this paper, we investigate the example of random feature ridge regression (RFRR). This model can be seen either as a finite-rank approximation to kernel ridge regression (KRR), or as a simplified model for neural networks trained in the so-called lazy regime. We consider covariates uniformly distributed on the $d$-dimensional sphere and compute sharp asymptotics for the RFRR test error in the high-dimensional polynomial scaling, where $p,n,d \to \infty$ while $p/ d^{\kappa_1}$ and $n / d^{\kappa_2}$ stay constant, for all $\kappa_1 , \kappa_2 \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$. These asymptotics precisely characterize the impact of the number of random features and regularization parameter on the test performance. In particular, RFRR exhibits an intuitive trade-off between approximation and generalization power. For $n = o(p)$, the sample size $n$ is the bottleneck and RFRR achieves the same performance as KRR (which is equivalent to taking $p = \infty$). On the other hand, if $p = o(n)$, the number of random features $p$ is the limiting factor and RFRR test error matches the approximation error of the random feature model class (akin to taking $n = \infty$). Finally, a double descent appears at $n= p$, a phenomenon that was previously only characterized in the linear scaling $\kappa_1 = \kappa_2 = 1$.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Microcanonical Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microcanonical gradient descent is a sampling procedure for energy-based models allowing for efficient sampling of distributions in high dimension. It works by transporting samples from a high-entropy distribution, such as Gaussian white noise, to a low-energy region using gradient descent. We put this model in the framework of normalizing flows, showing how it can often overfit by losing an unnecessary amount of entropy in the descent. As a remedy, we propose a mean-field microcanonical gradient descent that samples several weakly coupled data points simultaneously, allowing for better control of the entropy loss while paying little in terms of likelihood fit. We study these models in the context of financial time series, illustrating the improvements on both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity linear regression for scientific machine learning from scarce data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods, which fit to data the parameters of a given parameterized model class, have garnered significant interest as potential methods for learning surrogate models for complex engineering systems for which traditional simulation is expensive. However, in many scientific and engineering settings, generating high-fidelity data on which to train ML models is expensive, and the available budget for generating training data is limited. ML models trained on the resulting scarce high-fidelity data have high variance and are sensitive to vagaries of the training data set. We propose a new multifidelity training approach for scientific machine learning that exploits the scientific context where data of varying fidelities and costs are available; for example high-fidelity data may be generated by an expensive fully resolved physics simulation whereas lower-fidelity data may arise from a cheaper model based on simplifying assumptions. We use the multifidelity data to define new multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators for the unknown parameters of linear regression models, and provide theoretical analyses that guarantee the approach's accuracy and improved robustness to small training budgets. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that multifidelity learned models trained on scarce high-fidelity data and additional low-fidelity data achieve order-of-magnitude lower model variance than standard models trained on only high-fidelity data of comparable cost. This illustrates that in the scarce data regime, our multifidelity training strategy yields models with lower expected error than standard training approaches.</description>

      <title>Neural reproducing kernel Banach spaces and representer theorems for deep networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the function spaces defined by neural networks helps to understand the corresponding learning models and their inductive bias. While in some limits neural networks correspond to function spaces that are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, these regimes do not capture the properties of the networks used in practice. In contrast, in this paper we show that deep neural networks define suitable reproducing kernel Banach spaces.
  These spaces are equipped with norms that enforce a form of sparsity, enabling them to adapt to potential latent structures within the input data and their representations. In particular, leveraging the theory of reproducing kernel Banach spaces, combined with variational results, we derive representer theorems that justify the finite architectures commonly employed in applications. Our study extends analogous results for shallow networks and can be seen as a step towards considering more practically plausible neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature.The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Sketching the Heat Kernel: Using Gaussian Processes to Embed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, non-deterministic method for embedding data in low-dimensional Euclidean space based on computing realizations of a Gaussian process depending on the geometry of the data. This type of embedding first appeared in (Adler et al, 2018) as a theoretical model for a generic manifold in high dimensions.
  In particular, we take the covariance function of the Gaussian process to be the heat kernel, and computing the embedding amounts to sketching a matrix representing the heat kernel. The Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion reveals that the straight-line distances in the embedding approximate the diffusion distance in a probabilistic sense, avoiding the need for sharp cutoffs and maintaining some of the smaller-scale structure.
  Our method demonstrates further advantage in its robustness to outliers. We justify the approach with both theory and experiments.</description>

      <title>Characterising harmful data sources when constructing multi-fidelity surrogate models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate modelling techniques have seen growing attention in recent years when applied to both modelling and optimisation of industrial design problems. These techniques are highly relevant when assessing the performance of a particular design carries a high cost, as the overall cost can be mitigated via the construction of a model to be queried in lieu of the available high-cost source. The construction of these models can sometimes employ other sources of information which are both cheaper and less accurate. The existence of these sources however poses the question of which sources should be used when constructing a model. Recent studies have attempted to characterise harmful data sources to guide practitioners in choosing when to ignore a certain source. These studies have done so in a synthetic setting, characterising sources using a large amount of data that is not available in practice. Some of these studies have also been shown to potentially suffer from bias in the benchmarks used in the analysis. In this study, we present a characterisation of harmful low-fidelity sources using only the limited data available to train a surrogate model. We employ recently developed benchmark filtering techniques to conduct a bias-free assessment, providing objectively varied benchmark suites of different sizes for future research. Analysing one of these benchmark suites with the technique known as Instance Space Analysis, we provide an intuitive visualisation of when a low-fidelity source should be used and use this analysis to provide guidelines that can be used in an applied industrial setting.</description>

      <title>Early Directional Convergence in Deep Homogeneous Neural Networks for Small Initializations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the gradient flow dynamics that arise when training deep homogeneous neural networks, starting with small initializations. The present work considers neural networks that are assumed to have locally Lipschitz gradients and an order of homogeneity strictly greater than two. This paper demonstrates that for sufficiently small initializations, during the early stages of training, the weights of the neural network remain small in norm and approximately converge in direction along the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the neural correlation function introduced in [1]. Additionally, for square loss and under a separability assumption on the weights of neural networks, a similar directional convergence of gradient flow dynamics is shown near certain saddle points of the loss function.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Hybrid Latent Dynamics: A Learn-to-Identify Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern applications increasingly require unsupervised learning of latent dynamics from high-dimensional time-series. This presents a significant challenge of identifiability: many abstract latent representations may reconstruct observations, yet do they guarantee an adequate identification of the governing dynamics? This paper investigates this challenge from two angles: the use of physics inductive bias specific to the data being modeled, and a learn-to-identify strategy that separates forecasting objectives from the data used for the identification. We combine these two strategies in a novel framework for unsupervised meta-learning of hybrid latent dynamics (Meta-HyLaD) with: 1) a latent dynamic function that hybridize known mathematical expressions of prior physics with neural functions describing its unknown errors, and 2) a meta-learning formulation to learn to separately identify both components of the hybrid dynamics. Through extensive experiments on five physics and one biomedical systems, we provide strong evidence for the benefits of Meta-HyLaD to integrate rich prior knowledge while identifying their gap to observed data.</description>

      <title>Efficient geometric Markov chain Monte Carlo for nonlinear Bayesian inversion enabled by derivative-informed neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an operator learning approach to accelerate geometric Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for solving infinite-dimensional nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems. While geometric MCMC employs high-quality proposals that adapt to posterior local geometry, it requires computing local gradient and Hessian information of the log-likelihood, incurring a high cost when the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map is defined through expensive model simulations. We consider a delayed-acceptance geometric MCMC method driven by a neural operator surrogate of the PtO map, where the proposal is designed to exploit fast surrogate approximations of the log-likelihood and, simultaneously, its gradient and Hessian. To achieve a substantial speedup, the surrogate needs to be accurate in predicting both the observable and its parametric derivative (the derivative of the observable with respect to the parameter). Training such a surrogate via conventional operator learning using input--output samples often demands a prohibitively large number of model simulations. In this work, we present an extension of derivative-informed operator learning [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., J. Comput. Phys., 496 (2024)] using input--output--derivative training samples. Such a learning method leads to derivative-informed neural operator (DINO) surrogates that accurately predict the observable and its parametric derivative at a significantly lower training cost than the conventional method. Cost and error analysis for reduced basis DINO surrogates are provided. Numerical studies on PDE-constrained Bayesian inversion demonstrate that DINO-driven MCMC generates effective posterior samples 3--9 times faster than geometric MCMC and 60--97 times faster than prior geometry-based MCMC. Furthermore, the training cost of DINO surrogates breaks even after collecting merely 10--25 effective posterior samples compared to geometric MCMC.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization that Limits Search Region to Lower Dimensions Utilizing Local GPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization of product and system characteristics is required in many fields, including design and control. Bayesian optimization (BO) is often used when there are high observing costs, because BO theoretically guarantees an upper bound on regret. However, computational costs increase exponentially with the number of parameters to be optimized, decreasing search efficiency. We propose a BO that limits the search region to lower dimensions and utilizes local Gaussian process regression (LGPR) to scale the BO to higher dimensions. LGPR treats the low-dimensional search region as "local," improving prediction accuracies there. The LGPR model is trained on a local subset of data specific to that region. This improves prediction accuracy and search efficiency and reduces the time complexity of matrix inversion in the Gaussian process regression. In evaluations with 20D Ackley and Rosenbrock functions, search efficiencies are equal to or higher than those of the compared methods, improved by about 69% and 40% from the case without LGPR. We apply our method to an automatic design task for a power semiconductor device. We successfully reduce the specific on-resistance to 25% better than a conventional method and 3.4% better than without LGPR.</description>

      <title>A Sparsity Principle for Partially Observable Causal Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal representation learning aims at identifying high-level causal variables from perceptual data. Most methods assume that all latent causal variables are captured in the high-dimensional observations. We instead consider a partially observed setting, in which each measurement only provides information about a subset of the underlying causal state. Prior work has studied this setting with multiple domains or views, each depending on a fixed subset of latents. Here, we focus on learning from unpaired observations from a dataset with an instance-dependent partial observability pattern. Our main contribution is to establish two identifiability results for this setting: one for linear mixing functions without parametric assumptions on the underlying causal model, and one for piecewise linear mixing functions with Gaussian latent causal variables. Based on these insights, we propose two methods for estimating the underlying causal variables by enforcing sparsity in the inferred representation. Experiments on different simulated datasets and established benchmarks highlight the effectiveness of our approach in recovering the ground-truth latents.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Locally Adaptive and Scalable Diffusion-Based Sampling Methods for Deep Bayesian Neural Network Posteriors</title>

Abstract: Achieving robust uncertainty quantification for deep neural networks represents an important requirement in many real-world applications of deep learning such as medical imaging where it is necessary to assess the reliability of a neural network's prediction. Bayesian neural networks are a promising approach for modeling uncertainties in deep neural networks. Unfortunately, generating samples from the posterior distribution of neural networks is a major challenge. One significant advance in that direction would be the incorporation of adaptive step sizes, similar to modern neural network optimizers, into Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling algorithms without significantly increasing computational demand. Over the past years, several papers have introduced sampling algorithms with claims that they achieve this property. However, do they indeed converge to the correct distribution? In this paper, we demonstrate that these methods can have a substantial bias in the distribution they sample, even in the limit of vanishing step sizes and at full batch size.</description>

      <title>Verifix: Post-Training Correction to Improve Label Noise Robustness with Verified Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Label corruption, where training samples have incorrect labels, can significantly degrade the performance of machine learning models. This corruption often arises from non-expert labeling or adversarial attacks. Acquiring large, perfectly labeled datasets is costly, and retraining large models from scratch when a clean dataset becomes available is computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we propose Post-Training Correction, a new paradigm that adjusts model parameters after initial training to mitigate label noise, eliminating the need for retraining. We introduce Verifix, a novel Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based algorithm that leverages a small, verified dataset to correct the model weights using a single update. Verifix uses SVD to estimate a Clean Activation Space and then projects the model's weights onto this space to suppress activations corresponding to corrupted data. We demonstrate Verifix's effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world label noise. Experiments on the CIFAR dataset with 25% synthetic corruption show 7.36% generalization improvements on average. Additionally, we observe generalization improvements of up to 2.63% on naturally corrupted datasets like WebVision1.0 and Clothing1M.</description>

      <title>Human Alignment of Large Language Models through Online Preference Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring alignment of language models' outputs with human preferences is critical to guarantee a useful, safe, and pleasant user experience. Thus, human alignment has been extensively studied recently and several methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Policy Optimisation (DPO) and Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) have emerged. In this paper, our contribution is two-fold. First, we show the equivalence between two recent alignment methods, namely Identity Policy Optimisation (IPO) and Nash Mirror Descent (Nash-MD). Second, we introduce a generalisation of IPO, named IPO-MD, that leverages the regularised sampling approach proposed by Nash-MD.
  This equivalence may seem surprising at first sight, since IPO is an offline method whereas Nash-MD is an online method using a preference model. However, this equivalence can be proven when we consider the online version of IPO, that is when both generations are sampled by the online policy and annotated by a trained preference model. Optimising the IPO loss with such a stream of data becomes then equivalent to finding the Nash equilibrium of the preference model through self-play. Building on this equivalence, we introduce the IPO-MD algorithm that generates data with a mixture policy (between the online and reference policy) similarly as the general Nash-MD algorithm. We compare online-IPO and IPO-MD to different online versions of existing losses on preference data such as DPO and SLiC on a summarisation task.</description>

      <title>Extracting Explanations, Justification, and Uncertainty from Black-Box Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) do not inherently compute or exhibit empirically-justified task confidence. In mission critical applications, it is important to both understand associated DNN reasoning and its supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian approach to extract explanations, justifications, and uncertainty estimates from DNNs. Our approach is efficient both in terms of memory and computation, and can be applied to any black box DNN without any retraining, including applications to anomaly detection and out-of-distribution detection tasks. We validate our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and show that it can significantly improve the interpretability and reliability of DNNs.</description>

      <title>When can we Approximate Wide Contrastive Models with Neural Tangent Kernels and Principal Component Analysis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning is a paradigm for learning representations from unlabelled data that has been highly successful for image and text data. Several recent works have examined contrastive losses to claim that contrastive models effectively learn spectral embeddings, while few works show relations between (wide) contrastive models and kernel principal component analysis (PCA). However, it is not known if trained contrastive models indeed correspond to kernel methods or PCA. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics of two-layer contrastive models, with non-linear activation, and answer when these models are close to PCA or kernel methods. It is well known in the supervised setting that neural networks are equivalent to neural tangent kernel (NTK) machines, and that the NTK of infinitely wide networks remains constant during training. We provide the first convergence results of NTK for contrastive losses, and present a nuanced picture: NTK of wide networks remains almost constant for cosine similarity based contrastive losses, but not for losses based on dot product similarity. We further study the training dynamics of contrastive models with orthogonality constraints on output layer, which is implicitly assumed in works relating contrastive learning to spectral embedding. Our deviation bounds suggest that representations learned by contrastive models are close to the principal components of a certain matrix computed from random features. We empirically show that our theoretical results possibly hold beyond two-layer networks.</description>

      <title>Implicit Regularization of Gradient Flow on One-Layer Softmax Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gradient flow on the exponential loss for a classification problem with a one-layer softmax attention model, where the key and query weight matrices are trained separately. Under a separability assumption on the data, we show that when gradient flow achieves the minimal loss value, it further implicitly minimizes the nuclear norm of the product of the key and query weight matrices. Such implicit regularization can be described by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) problem with respect to the attention weights. This finding contrasts with prior results showing that the gradient descent induces an implicit regularization on the Frobenius norm on the product weight matrix when the key and query matrices are combined into a single weight matrix for training. For diagonal key and query matrices, our analysis builds upon the reparameterization technique and exploits approximate KKT conditions of the SVM associated with the classification data. Moreover, the results are extended to general weights configurations given proper alignment of the weight matrices' singular spaces with the data features at initialization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise plagues many numerical datasets, where the recorded values in the data may fail to match the true underlying values due to reasons including: erroneous sensors, data entry/processing mistakes, or imperfect human estimates. We consider general regression settings with covariates and a potentially corrupted response whose observed values may contain errors. By accounting for various uncertainties, we introduced veracity scores that distinguish between genuine errors and natural data fluctuations, conditioned on the available covariate information in the dataset. We propose a simple yet efficient filtering procedure for eliminating potential errors, and establish theoretical guarantees for our method. We also contribute a new error detection benchmark involving 5 regression datasets with real-world numerical errors (for which the true values are also known). In this benchmark and additional simulation studies, our method identifies incorrect values with better precision/recall than other approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Monte Carlo sampler from the reverse diffusion process. Unlike the practice of diffusion models, where the intermediary updates -- the score functions -- are learned with a neural network, we transform the score matching problem into a mean estimation one. By estimating the means of the regularized posterior distributions, we derive a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm called reverse diffusion Monte Carlo (rdMC), which is distinct from the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We determine the sample size from the error tolerance and the properties of the posterior distribution to yield an algorithm that can approximately sample the target distribution with any desired accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate and prove under suitable conditions that sampling with rdMC can be significantly faster than that with MCMC. For multi-modal target distributions such as those in Gaussian mixture models, rdMC greatly improves over the Langevin-style MCMC sampling methods both theoretically and in practice. The proposed rdMC method offers a new perspective and solution beyond classical MCMC algorithms for the challenging complex distributions.</description>

Abstract: Single-cell technologies offer insights into molecular feature distributions, but comparing them poses challenges. We propose a kernel-testing framework for non-linear cell-wise distribution comparison, analyzing gene expression and epigenomic modifications. Our method allows feature-wise and global transcriptome/epigenome comparisons, revealing cell population heterogeneities. Using a classifier based on embedding variability, we identify transitions in cell states, overcoming limitations of traditional single-cell analysis. Applied to single-cell ChIP-Seq data, our approach identifies untreated breast cancer cells with an epigenomic profile resembling persister cells. This demonstrates the effectiveness of kernel testing in uncovering subtle population variations that might be missed by other methods.</description>

      <title>A path-norm toolkit for modern networks: consequences, promises and challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01225v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces the first toolkit around path-norms that fully encompasses general DAG ReLU networks with biases, skip connections and any operation based on the extraction of order statistics: max pooling, GroupSort etc. This toolkit notably allows us to establish generalization bounds for modern neural networks that are not only the most widely applicable path-norm based ones, but also recover or beat the sharpest known bounds of this type. These extended path-norms further enjoy the usual benefits of path-norms: ease of computation, invariance under the symmetries of the network, and improved sharpness on layered fully-connected networks compared to the product of operator norms, another complexity measure most commonly used.
  The versatility of the toolkit and its ease of implementation allow us to challenge the concrete promises of path-norm-based generalization bounds, by numerically evaluating the sharpest known bounds for ResNets on ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Entropic (Gromov) Wasserstein Flow Matching with GENOT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) theory has reshaped the field of generative modeling: Combined with neural networks, recent \textit{Neural OT} (N-OT) solvers use OT as an inductive bias, to focus on ``thrifty'' mappings that minimize average displacement costs. This core principle has fueled the successful application of N-OT solvers to high-stakes scientific challenges, notably single-cell genomics. N-OT solvers are, however, increasingly confronted with practical challenges: while most N-OT solvers can handle squared-Euclidean costs, they must be repurposed to handle more general costs; their reliance on deterministic Monge maps as well as mass conservation constraints can easily go awry in the presence of outliers; mapping points \textit{across} heterogeneous spaces is out of their reach. While each of these challenges has been explored independently, we propose a new framework that can handle, natively, all of these needs. The \textit{generative entropic neural OT} (GENOT) framework models the conditional distribution $\pi_\varepsilon(\*y|\*x)$ of an optimal \textit{entropic} coupling $\pi_\varepsilon$, using conditional flow matching. GENOT is generative, and can transport points \textit{across} spaces, guided by sample-based, unbalanced solutions to the Gromov-Wasserstein problem, that can use any cost. We showcase our approach on both synthetic and single-cell datasets, using GENOT to model cell development, predict cellular responses, and translate between data modalities.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret Bounds of (Multinomial) Logistic Bandits via Regret-to-Confidence-Set Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logistic bandit is a ubiquitous framework of modeling users' choices, e.g., click vs. no click for advertisement recommender system. We observe that the prior works overlook or neglect dependencies in $S \geq \lVert \theta_\star \rVert_2$, where $\theta_\star \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the unknown parameter vector, which is particularly problematic when $S$ is large, e.g., $S \geq d$. In this work, we improve the dependency on $S$ via a novel approach called {\it regret-to-confidence set conversion (R2CS)}, which allows us to construct a convex confidence set based on only the \textit{existence} of an online learning algorithm with a regret guarantee. Using R2CS, we obtain a strict improvement in the regret bound w.r.t. $S$ in logistic bandits while retaining computational feasibility and the dependence on other factors such as $d$ and $T$. We apply our new confidence set to the regret analyses of logistic bandits with a new martingale concentration step that circumvents an additional factor of $S$. We then extend this analysis to multinomial logistic bandits and obtain similar improvements in the regret, showing the efficacy of R2CS. While we applied R2CS to the (multinomial) logistic model, R2CS is a generic approach for developing confidence sets that can be used for various models, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The AL$\ell_0$CORE Tensor Decomposition for Sparse Count Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces AL$\ell_0$CORE, a new form of probabilistic non-negative tensor decomposition. AL$\ell_0$CORE is a Tucker decomposition where the number of non-zero elements (i.e., the $\ell_0$-norm) of the core tensor is constrained to a preset value $Q$ much smaller than the size of the core. While the user dictates the total budget $Q$, the locations and values of the non-zero elements are latent variables and allocated across the core tensor during inference. AL$\ell_0$CORE -- i.e., $allo$cated $\ell_0$-$co$nstrained $core$-- thus enjoys both the computational tractability of CP decomposition and the qualitatively appealing latent structure of Tucker. In a suite of real-data experiments, we demonstrate that AL$\ell_0$CORE typically requires only tiny fractions (e.g.,~1%) of the full core to achieve the same results as full Tucker decomposition at only a correspondingly tiny fraction of the cost.</description>

      <title>Terminal Embeddings in Sublinear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently (Elkin, Filtser, Neiman 2017) introduced the concept of a {\it terminal embedding} from one metric space $(X,d_X)$ to another $(Y,d_Y)$ with a set of designated terminals $T\subset X$. Such an embedding $f$ is said to have distortion $\rho\ge 1$ if $\rho$ is the smallest value such that there exists a constant $C&gt;0$ satisfying
  \begin{equation*}
  \forall x\in T\ \forall q\in X,\ C d_X(x, q) \le d_Y(f(x), f(q)) \le C \rho d_X(x, q) .
  \end{equation*}
  When $X,Y$ are both Euclidean metrics with $Y$ being $m$-dimensional, recently (Narayanan, Nelson 2019), following work of (Mahabadi, Makarychev, Makarychev, Razenshteyn 2018), showed that distortion $1+\epsilon$ is achievable via such a terminal embedding with $m = O(\epsilon^{-2}\log n)$ for $n := |T|$. This generalizes the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which only preserves distances within $T$ and not to $T$ from the rest of space. The downside of prior work is that evaluating their embedding on some $q\in \mathbb{R}^d$ required solving a semidefinite program with $\Theta(n)$ constraints in~$m$ variables and thus required some superlinear $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ runtime. Our main contribution in this work is to give a new data structure for computing terminal embeddings. We show how to pre-process $T$ to obtain an almost linear-space data structure that supports computing the terminal embedding image of any $q\in\mathbb{R}^d$ in sublinear time $O^* (n^{1-\Theta(\epsilon^2)} + d)$. To accomplish this, we leverage tools developed in the context of approximate nearest neighbor search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.07835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With model trustworthiness being crucial for sensitive real-world applications, practitioners are putting more and more focus on improving the uncertainty calibration of deep neural networks. Calibration errors are designed to quantify the reliability of probabilistic predictions but their estimators are usually biased and inconsistent. In this work, we introduce the framework of proper calibration errors, which relates every calibration error to a proper score and provides a respective upper bound with optimal estimation properties. This relationship can be used to reliably quantify the model calibration improvement. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the shortcomings of commonly used estimators compared to our approach. Due to the wide applicability of proper scores, this gives a natural extension of recalibration beyond classification.</description>

      <title>Can Direct Latent Model Learning Solve Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning state representations from potentially high-dimensional observations, with the goal of controlling an unknown partially observable system. We pursue a direct latent model learning approach, where a dynamic model in some latent state space is learned by predicting quantities directly related to planning (e.g., costs) without reconstructing the observations. In particular, we focus on an intuitive cost-driven state representation learning method for solving Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, one of the most fundamental partially observable control problems. As our main results, we establish finite-sample guarantees of finding a near-optimal state representation function and a near-optimal controller using the directly learned latent model. To the best of our knowledge, despite various empirical successes, prior to this work it was unclear if such a cost-driven latent model learner enjoys finite-sample guarantees. Our work underscores the value of predicting multi-step costs, an idea that is key to our theory, and notably also an idea that is known to be empirically valuable for learning state representations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis for Over-parameterized Linear Model without Sparsity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of high-dimensional Bayesian statistics, a plethora of methodologies have been developed, including various prior distributions that result in parameter sparsity. However, such priors exhibit limitations in handling the spectral eigenvector structure of data, rendering estimations less effective for analyzing the over-parameterized models (high-dimensional linear models that do not assume sparsity) developed in recent years. This study introduces a Bayesian approach that employs a prior distribution dependent on the eigenvectors of data covariance matrices without inducing parameter sparsity. We also provide contraction rates of the derived posterior estimation and develop a truncated Gaussian approximation of the posterior distribution. The former demonstrates the efficiency of posterior estimation, whereas the latter facilitates the uncertainty quantification of parameters via a Bernstein--von Mises-type approach. These findings suggest that Bayesian methods capable of handling data spectra and estimating non-sparse high-dimensional parameters are feasible.</description>

      <title>DataInf: Efficiently Estimating Data Influence in LoRA-tuned LLMs and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the impact of training data points is crucial for understanding the outputs of machine learning models and for improving the transparency of the AI pipeline. The influence function is a principled and popular data attribution method, but its computational cost often makes it challenging to use. This issue becomes more pronounced in the setting of large language models and text-to-image models. In this work, we propose DataInf, an efficient influence approximation method that is practical for large-scale generative AI models. Leveraging an easy-to-compute closed-form expression, DataInf outperforms existing influence computation algorithms in terms of computational and memory efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows that DataInf is particularly well-suited for parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we show that DataInf accurately approximates influence scores and is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods. In applications to RoBERTa-large, Llama-2-13B-chat, and stable-diffusion-v1.5 models, DataInf effectively identifies the most influential fine-tuning examples better than other approximate influence scores. Moreover, it can help to identify which data points are mislabeled.</description>

Abstract: Consistency Models (CM) (Song et al., 2023) accelerate score-based diffusion model sampling at the cost of sample quality but lack a natural way to trade-off quality for speed. To address this limitation, we propose Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM), a generalization encompassing CM and score-based models as special cases. CTM trains a single neural network that can -- in a single forward pass -- output scores (i.e., gradients of log-density) and enables unrestricted traversal between any initial and final time along the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in a diffusion process. CTM enables the efficient combination of adversarial training and denoising score matching loss to enhance performance and achieves new state-of-the-art FIDs for single-step diffusion model sampling on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.73) and ImageNet at 64x64 resolution (FID 1.92). CTM also enables a new family of sampling schemes, both deterministic and stochastic, involving long jumps along the ODE solution trajectories. It consistently improves sample quality as computational budgets increase, avoiding the degradation seen in CM. Furthermore, unlike CM, CTM's access to the score function can streamline the adoption of established controllable/conditional generation methods from the diffusion community. This access also enables the computation of likelihood. The code is available at https://github.com/sony/ctm.</description>

      <title>Effective Structural Encodings via Local Curvature Profiles</title>

Abstract: Structural and Positional Encodings can significantly improve the performance of Graph Neural Networks in downstream tasks. Recent literature has begun to systematically investigate differences in the structural properties that these approaches encode, as well as performance trade-offs between them. However, the question of which structural properties yield the most effective encoding remains open. In this paper, we investigate this question from a geometric perspective. We propose a novel structural encoding based on discrete Ricci curvature (Local Curvature Profiles, short LCP) and show that it significantly outperforms existing encoding approaches. We further show that combining local structural encodings, such as LCP, with global positional encodings improves downstream performance, suggesting that they capture complementary geometric information. Finally, we compare different encoding types with (curvature-based) rewiring techniques. Rewiring has recently received a surge of interest due to its ability to improve the performance of Graph Neural Networks by mitigating over-smoothing and over-squashing effects. Our results suggest that utilizing curvature information for structural encodings delivers significantly larger performance increases than rewiring.</description>

      <title>A Hitchhiker's Guide to Geometric GNNs for 3D Atomic Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in computational modelling of atomic systems, spanning molecules, proteins, and materials, represent them as geometric graphs with atoms embedded as nodes in 3D Euclidean space. In these graphs, the geometric attributes transform according to the inherent physical symmetries of 3D atomic systems, including rotations and translations in Euclidean space, as well as node permutations. In recent years, Geometric Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the preferred machine learning architecture powering applications ranging from protein structure prediction to molecular simulations and material generation. Their specificity lies in the inductive biases they leverage - such as physical symmetries and chemical properties - to learn informative representations of these geometric graphs.
  In this opinionated paper, we provide a comprehensive and self-contained overview of the field of Geometric GNNs for 3D atomic systems. We cover fundamental background material and introduce a pedagogical taxonomy of Geometric GNN architectures: (1) invariant networks, (2) equivariant networks in Cartesian basis, (3) equivariant networks in spherical basis, and (4) unconstrained networks. Additionally, we outline key datasets and application areas and suggest future research directions. The objective of this work is to present a structured perspective on the field, making it accessible to newcomers and aiding practitioners in gaining an intuition for its mathematical abstractions.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Score Estimation in Diffusion Models: Optimization and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool rivaling GANs in generating high-quality samples with improved fidelity, flexibility, and robustness. A key component of these models is to learn the score function through score matching. Despite empirical success on various tasks, it remains unclear whether gradient-based algorithms can learn the score function with a provable accuracy. As a first step toward answering this question, this paper establishes a mathematical framework for analyzing score estimation using neural networks trained by gradient descent. Our analysis covers both the optimization and the generalization aspects of the learning procedure. In particular, we propose a parametric form to formulate the denoising score-matching problem as a regression with noisy labels. Compared to the standard supervised learning setup, the score-matching problem introduces distinct challenges, including unbounded input, vector-valued output, and an additional time variable, preventing existing techniques from being applied directly. In this paper, we show that with proper designs, the evolution of neural networks during training can be accurately modeled by a series of kernel regression tasks. Furthermore, by applying an early-stopping rule for gradient descent and leveraging recent developments in neural tangent kernels, we establish the first generalization error (sample complexity) bounds for learning the score function with neural networks, despite the presence of noise in the observations. Our analysis is grounded in a novel parametric form of the neural network and an innovative connection between score matching and regression analysis, facilitating the application of advanced statistical and optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Stein Boltzmann Sampling: A Variational Approach for Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04689v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new flow-based method for global optimization of Lipschitz functions, called Stein Boltzmann Sampling (SBS). Our method samples from the Boltzmann distribution that becomes asymptotically uniform over the set of the minimizers of the function to be optimized. Candidate solutions are sampled via the \emph{Stein Variational Gradient Descent} algorithm. We prove the asymptotic convergence of our method, introduce two SBS variants, and provide a detailed comparison with several state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms on various benchmark functions. The design of our method, the theoretical results, and our experiments, suggest that SBS is particularly well-suited to be used as a continuation of efficient global optimization methods as it can produce better solutions while making a good use of the budget.</description>

      <title>Computational-Statistical Gaps in Gaussian Single-Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-Index Models are high-dimensional regression problems with planted structure, whereby labels depend on an unknown one-dimensional projection of the input via a generic, non-linear, and potentially non-deterministic transformation. As such, they encompass a broad class of statistical inference tasks, and provide a rich template to study statistical and computational trade-offs in the high-dimensional regime.
  While the information-theoretic sample complexity to recover the hidden direction is linear in the dimension $d$, we show that computationally efficient algorithms, both within the Statistical Query (SQ) and the Low-Degree Polynomial (LDP) framework, necessarily require $\Omega(d^{k^\star/2})$ samples, where $k^\star$ is a "generative" exponent associated with the model that we explicitly characterize. Moreover, we show that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by establishing matching upper bounds using a partial-trace algorithm. Therefore, our results provide evidence of a sharp computational-to-statistical gap (under both the SQ and LDP class) whenever $k^\star&gt;2$. To complete the study, we provide examples of smooth and Lipschitz deterministic target functions with arbitrarily large generative exponents $k^\star$.</description>
