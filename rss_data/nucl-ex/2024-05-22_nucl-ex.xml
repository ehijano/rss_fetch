      <title>Electric field induction in quark-gluon plasma due to thermoelectric effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions produce quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is locally thermalized. QGP with higher thermal conductivity advances towards global thermalization. Being made of electrically charged particles (quarks), QGP exhibits interesting thermoelectric phenomena during its evolution, resulting in the induction of an electric field in the medium. For the first time, we estimate the induced electric field in the QGP due to thermoelectric effect. This can be seen even in the QGP produced in the head-on collisions. The Seebeck coefficient is essential in determining the induced field. However, spectator current can produce a magnetic field in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. This breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric coefficient matrix and introduces magneto-Seebeck and Nernst coefficients that contribute to the induced electric field in peripheral collisions. We have taken care of the temperature evolution of QGP with different hydrodynamic cooling rates to calculate the transport coefficients. The induced electric field is estimated with the cooling rate obtained from Gubser hydrodynamic flow. We estimated the space-time profile of the induced field and found that it is zero at the center and increases as we go away from the center. At the early time of evolution, the electric field can reach a maximum value of $eE \approx 1~m_\pi^2$, and the strength decreases in time. Moreover, we estimated the transport coefficients in the presence of the external time-varying magnetic field. The effect of the intensity and decay parameter of the magnetic field on the induced electric field is also explored.</description>

      <title>Prompt fission neutron spectra of 240Pu(n, F)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variation of fission neutron spectra of 240Pu (sf) and 240Pu (n, F) for E up to 20 MeV predicted.Features of angle-integrated prompt fission neutron spectra of 240Pu (n, F) stem from simultaneous analysis of data for 238U (n, F), 239Pu (n, F) and available data on 240Pu (n, F) prompt fission neutron spectra.The data on average energies of 240Pu (n, F) prompt fission neutron spectra support the approach pursued in case of 238U (n, F) and 239Pu (n, F). Soft influence of exclusive neutron spectra on prompt fission neutron spectra observed in case of 240Pu (n, F) and 240Pu (n, xnf) at E = 7-8 MeV. The largest relative amplitude of exclusive neutron spectra 240Pu (n, xnf) is envisaged at E = 6-6.25 MeV. Prompt fission neutron spectra of 240Pu (n, F) are harder than those of 238U (n,F), but softer than prompt fission neutron spectra for 239Pu(n, F). 240Pu (n, F) prompt fission neutron spectra 240Pu shape is rather close to that of 239Pu(n, F), though the contribution of pre-fission neutrons is relatively higher. Exclusive neutron spectra (n, xnf) are consistent with (n,F) cross sections of 237-240Pu(n, F), as well as neutron emissive spectra of 239Pu(n, xn) at E = 14 MeV. We predict the exclusive pre-fission neutron spectra, exclusive neutron spectra of (n,xn) reactions, average total kinetic energy TKE of fission fragments and products, partials of of average prompt fission neutron number and observed prompt fission neutron spectra.</description>

      <title>Kaonic lead feasibility measurement at DA{\Phi}NE to solve the charged kaon mass discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An HPGe detector equipped with a transistor reset preamplifier and readout with a CAEN DT5781 fast pulse digitizer was employed in the measurement of X-rays from kaonic lead at the DA$\Phi$NE $e^+e^-$ collider at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati of INFN. A thin scintillator in front of a lead target was used to select kaons impinging on it and to form the trigger for the HPGe detector. We present the results of the kaonic lead feasibility measurement, where we show that the resolution of the HPGe detector in regular beam conditions remains the same as that without the beam and that a satisfactory background reduction can be achieved. This measurement serves as a test bed for future dedicated kaonic X-rays measurements for the more precise determination of the charged kaon mass.</description>

      <title>Analog-antianalog isospin mixing in $^{47}$K $\beta^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have measured the isospin mixing of the I$^\pi$= 1/2$^+$ E$_x$=2.599 MeV state in nearly-doubly-magic $^{47}$Ca with the isobaric analog 1/2$^+$ state of $^{47}$K. Using the TRIUMF atom trap for $\beta$ decay, we have measured a nonzero asymmetry of the progeny $^{47}$Ca with respect to the initial $^{47}$K spin polarization, which together with the $\beta$ asymmetry implies a nonzero ratio of Fermi to Gamow-Teller matrix elements $y$= 0.098$\pm$0.037 for the $1/2^+ \rightarrow 1/2^+$ transition. Interpreting $y$ as mixing between this state and the isobaric analog state implies a Coulomb matrix element magnitude 101 $\pm$ 37 keV. This relatively large matrix element supports a model from the literature of analog-antianalog isospin mixing, which predicts large matrix elements in cases involving excess neutrons over protons occupying more than one major shell. The result supports pursuing a search for time-reversal odd, parity-even, isovector interactions using a correlation in $^{47}$K $\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Probing configuration of $\alpha$ clusters with spectator particles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to use spectator particle yield ratios to probe the configuration of $\alpha$ clusters in $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O by their collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. The idea is illustrated based on initial density distributions with various $\alpha$-cluster configurations generated by a microscopic cluster model, and without $\alpha$ clusters from mean-field calculations. The multifragmentation of the spectator matter produces more spectator light nuclei including $\alpha$ clusters in collisions of nuclei with chain structure of $\alpha$ clusters, compared to those of nuclei with a more compact structure. The yield ratio of free spectator neutrons to spectator particles with mass-to-charge ratio $A/Z=2$ scaled by their masses can be practically measured by the zero-degree calorimeter (ZDC) at RHIC and LHC, serving as a clean probe free from modeling the complicated dynamics at midrapidities.</description>

      <title>A study of the fine-structure constant dependence of radiative capture in Halo-EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fine-structure constant dependence of the rates of some selected radiative capture reactions within the framework of so-called Halo Effective Field Theory in order to assess the adequacy of some assumptions made on the Coulomb penetrability. We find that this dependence deviates from that implied by a parameterization of the cross sections of this effect via a simple penetration factor. Some features of this fine-structure dependence are discussed, in particular its potential impact on the abundances of the light elements in primordial nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres predicts the stability of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the empirical success of the Weizsaecker mass formula, a predictive, physics-based, analytical estimate of the stability chart of nuclei has remained elusive. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides an excellent description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory is able to predict the most quoted ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$ for stable nuclides, in agreement with experimental observations without any fitting parameter. This provides a solution to a longstanding mystery in nuclear physics: until now, the stability of atomic nuclei was empirically described by the Bethe-Weizsaecker mass formula, which, only thanks to 4-5 adjustable fitting parameters, can capture the tendency of large nuclei to be rich in neutrons. The latter phenomenon was traditionally (qualitatively) explained in terms of a subtle balance between electrostatics and asymmetry effects due to the Pauli exclusion principle. We show that the larger stability of neutron-rich nuclei is the result of a maximized nuclear density, which is controlled by geometric packing considerations.</description>
