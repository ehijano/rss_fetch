      <title>Neutron matter from local chiral EFT interactions at large cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron matter is an important many-body system that provides valuable constraints for the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. Neutron-matter calculations employing chiral effective field theory (EFT) interactions have been extensively used for this purpose. Among the various many-body methods, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods stand out due to their nonperturbative nature and the achievable precision. However, QMC methods require local interactions as input, which leads to the appearance of stronger regulator artifacts as compared to non-local interactions. To circumvent this, we employ large-cutoff interactions derived within chiral EFT (400 MeV $\leq \Lambda_c \leq$ 700 MeV) for studies of pure neutron matter. These interactions have been adjusted to nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts, the triton binding energy, as well as the triton beta-decay half life. We find that regulator artifacts significantly decrease with increasing cutoff, leading to a significant reduction of uncertainties in the neutron-matter EOS. We discuss implications for the symmetry energy and demonstrate how our new calculations lead to a reduction in the theoretical uncertainty of predicted neutron-star radii by up to 30% for low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Emergence of High-Order Deformation in Rotating Transfermium Nuclei: A Microscopic Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational properties of the transfermium nuclei are investigated in the full deformation space by implementing a shell-model-like approach in the cranking covariant density functional theory on a three-dimensional lattice, where the pairing correlations, deformations, and moments of inertia are treated in a microscopic and self-consistent way. The kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia of the rotational bands observed in the transfermium nuclei $^{252}$No, $^{254}$No, $^{254}$Rf, and $^{256}$Rf are well reproduced without any adjustable parameters using a well-determined universal density functional. It is found for the first time that the emergence of the octupole deformation should be responsible for the significantly different rotational behavior observed in $^{252}$No and $^{254}$No. The present results provide a microscopic solution to the long-standing puzzle on the rotational behavior in No isotopes, and highlight the risk of investigating only the hexacontetrapole ($\beta_{60}$) deformation effects in rotating transfermium nuclei without considering the octupole deformation.</description>

      <title>Polarized Dipole Scattering Amplitudes meet the Valence Quark Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently revised small-$x$ helicity evolution, resumming the double-logarithmic factor, $\alpha_s\ln^2(1/x)$, allows for the study of helicity distributions of quarks and gluons at small Bjorken $x$, corresponding to high center-of-mass energy. In this work, we calculate the moderate-$x$ initial conditions in the regime, $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)\sim 1$, for the small-$x$ helicity evolution using a light-front valence quark model of the proton, which provides additional physical information about the target. The perturbative emission and absorption of a gluon by the valence quarks are also included. The results, given in Eqs. (35), provide a new set of initial conditions with a significantly reduced number of free parameters than conventional models. Consequently, the predictive power of small-$x$ helicity evolution is expected to improve once the initial conditions from this work are incorporated.</description>

      <title>High-precision analysis of the critical point in heavy-quark QCD at $N_t=6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binder-cumulant analysis of the critical point in the heavy-quark region of QCD is performed by Monte-Carlo simulations with the hopping-parameter expansion at $N_t=6$. We extend our previous analysis at $N_t=4$ to finer lattices and perform high-precision analyses on large spatial volumes up to the aspect ratio $LT=N_s/N_t=18$. Higher order terms in the hopping-parameter expansion are incorporated effectively up to 14th order. The numerical results show that the violation of the finite-size scaling becomes more prominent on the finer lattice at a given aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Understanding the approach to thermalization from the eigenspectrum of non-Abelian gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of SU(3) gauge theory with and without dynamical quarks (QCD) at thermal equilibrium using lattice gauge theory techniques. By measuring eigenstates of a massless overlap Dirac operator on the gauge configurations, we provide a gauge invariant method to study spectral properties of non-Abelian gauge theories. Whereas the majority of these eigenstates below the magnetic scale have universal nearest-neighbor level spacing fluctuations consistent with certain class of random matrix theories at temperatures away from the chiral crossover transition in QCD, a few among them start to become prominent just above the crossover forming clusters percolating over the entire volume. By matching the non-perturbative magnetic scales in a high temperature thermal state and a particular non-equilibrium chaotic state of QCD, we provide an estimate of thermalization time $\sim 1.44$ fm/c.</description>

      <title>Neutron-quark stars: Discerning viable alternatives for the higher-density part of the equation of state of compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By taking into account the latest observations and theoretical constraints, we investigate the merger and post-merger of binary neutron stars (NSs) with numerical simulations employing hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EOSs). We name our hybrid stars Neutron-quark stars (NQS), because the transition from hadrons to quarks starts at a density lower than the central density of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}$ stars. The two scenarios of transition to quark matter, a strong first-order phase transition (1PT) or a crossover, feature either a drop to almost zero or a rapid increase (peak) in the square of the sound speed $c_s^2$, implying a softening or stiffening during the transition, respectively. Although the properties of NQSs in equilibrium may not be distinguishable from those of NSs, we find that the post-merger gravitational-wave (GW) main frequency $f_2$ for the crossover scenario is generally lower than that of hadronic models with the same tidal deformability, indicating that a crossover transition is in principle observable when both the inspiral and post-merger signals are detected. Since it is viable according to current multi-messenger constraints, we also consider an EOS with a 1PT taking place at 1.8 times the nuclear saturation density ($n_0$), with a stiff quark EOS ($c_s^2 = 2/3~c^2$) after the transition. It is the first time that such a binary merger is studied numerically in full general relativity. Although its $f_2$ is $\sim 300$ Hz higher than that of its baseline, the relation between $f_2$ and the tidal deformability of inspiralling stars is close to that for hadronic EOSs.</description>

      <title>Ab initio investigation of the $^7$Li($p,e^+e^-$)$^8$Be process and the X17 boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of anomalies in the electron-positron angular correlations in high-energy decays in $^4$He, $^8$Be, and $^{12}$C have been reported recently by the ATOMKI collaboration. These could be explained by the creation and subsequent decay of a new boson with a mass of ${\sim}17$ MeV. Theoretical understanding of pair creation in the proton capture reactions used in these experiments is important for the interpretation of the anomalies. We apply the ab initio No-Core Shell Model with Continuum (NCSMC) to the proton capture on $^7$Li. The NCSMC describes both bound and unbound states in light nuclei in a unified way with chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions as the only input. We investigate the structure of $^8$Be, the $p+^7$Li elastic scattering, the $^7$Li($p,\gamma$)$^8$Be cross section and the internal pair creation $^7$Li($p,e^+ e^-$)$^8$Be. We discuss the impact of a proper treatment of the initial scattering state on the electron-positron angular correlation spectrum and compare our results to available ATOMKI data sets. Finally, we calculate $^7$Li($p,X$)$^8$Be cross sections for several proposed models of the hypothetical X17 particle.</description>

      <title>Factorization of photon induced processes in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate photon-photon scattering in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions (UPCs). We start by deriving an effective Lagrangian from first principles and then apply factorization techniques from Soft-Collinear effective theory (SCET). This approach allows us to decompose the photon-photon scattering cross-section into two primary factors: the generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs) and the hard scattering amplitude. We further analyze the emission of soft photons by final state leptons, incorporating a soft function into the cross section through an evolution method. Our analysis yields detailed predictions for observable angular correlations among the final state leptons. Specifically, we calculate the angular correlations characterized by the azimuthal parameters $\langle\cos 2\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\cos 4\phi\rangle$, highlighting the influence of initial photons polarization and recoil effects from final state soft photons.</description>
