      <title>Local aspects of topological quantization and the Wu-Yang Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we review how local potentials arise in the Wu-Yang topological quantization. We also discuss the isomorphism between the de Rham cohomology classes and Cech cohomology classes in such topological quantization. We also emphasize the importance and application of local and global information in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Optimal version of the fundamental theorem of chronogeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lightlikeness preserving mappings from the $4$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime $\mathcal{M}_4$ to itself under no additional regularity assumptions like continuity, surjectivity, or injectivity. We prove that such a mapping $\phi$ satisfies one of the following three conditions. (1) The mapping $\phi$ can be written as a composition of a Lorentz transformation, a multiplication by a positive scalar, and a translation. (2) There is an event $r\in \mathcal{M}_4$ such that $\phi(\mathcal{M}_4\setminus\{r\})$ is contained in one light cone. (3) There is a lightlike line $\ell$ such that $\phi(\mathcal{M}_4\setminus \ell)$ is contained in another lightlike line. Here, a line that is contained in some light cone in $\mathcal{M}_4$ is called a lightlike line. We also give several similar results on mappings defined on a certain subset of $\mathcal{M}_4$ or the compactification of $\mathcal{M}_4$.</description>

      <title>A Novel Generalisation of Supersymmetry: Quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-Oscillators and their `superisation'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a very simple toy model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-supersymmetric quantum system and show, via Klein's construction, how to understand the system as being an $N=2$ supersymmetric system with an extra $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading. That is, the commutation/anticommutation rules are defined via the standard boson/fermion rules, but the system still has an underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading that needs to be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Explicit Hamiltonian representations of meromorphic connections and duality from different perspectives: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose the explicit studies of $\hbar$-deformed meromorphic connections in $\mathfrak{gl}_3(\mathbb{C})$ with an unramified irregular pole at infinity of order $r_\infty=3$ and its spectral dual corresponding to the $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ Painlev\'{e} $4$ Lax pair with one vanishing monodromy at the finite pole. Using the apparent singularities and their dual partners on the spectral curves as Darboux coordinates, we obtain the Hamiltonian evolutions, their reductions to only one non-trivial direction, the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno tau-functions, the fundamental symplectic two-forms and some associated Hermitian matrix models on both sides. We then prove that the spectral duality connecting both sides extends to all these aspects as an explicit illustration of generalized Harnad's duality. We finally propose a conjecture relating the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential as the $\hbar=0$ evaluation of the Hamiltonian differential in these Darboux coordinates that could provide insights on the geometric interpretation of the $\hbar$ formal parameter.</description>

      <title>Towards 2-dimensional non-commutative integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We collect evidence that the notion of path-ordered non-abelian integration admits an extension to two dimensions. We propose the corresponding notion of non-abelian 2-form along the lines of Lie algebroid theory and argue it is an appropriate one. The processes of parallel transport and integration turn out to be subtly different in the 2-dimensional case; we discuss parallel transport along surfaces and present an indirect definition of a non-abelian integral. This integral includes, for specific choices of 2-forms, both abelian integrals and the continuous limit of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula as special cases; it interpolates between those cases and broadly generalizes them, allowing, for example, an analog of path-exponential with local, point-depending commutators to be spoken about. We comment on all these objects, their relations, gauge symmetries and geometrical meaning, and roughly sketch a plausible order-by-order procedure for obtaining formulas for non-abelian integrals. The exposition is reasonably concrete, relying on no notions more abstract than sections of vector bundles and homotopies.</description>

      <title>Modular Hamiltonian and modular flow of massless fermions on a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine explicitly the modular flow and the modular Hamiltonian for massless free fermions in diamonds on a cylinder in 1+1 dimensions. We consider both periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions, the ground state in the antiperiodic case and the most general family of quasi-free zero-energy ground states in the periodic case, which depend on four parameters and are generally mixed. While for the antiperiodic ground state and one periodic ground state (the maximally mixed zero-temperature state) the modular data is known, our results for the generic ground state in the periodic case are completely new. We find that generically both the modular flow and the modular Hamiltonian are non-local, and we show that in the parametric limit where the state becomes pure the modular data becomes local. Moreover, even in the local case the modular flow generically mixes the two chiralities. This kind of behavior has not been observed previously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate time-dependent spherically symmetric Kantowski-Sachs teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity in vacuum and in a perfect isotropic fluid. We first find the field equations and solve for new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. By using a power-law ansatz for the coframe functions, we find some new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ vacuum solutions. We then proceed to find new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions in a perfect isotropic fluid with both linear and non-linear equation of state. We find several new exact and approximate teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. These classes of new solutions are relevant for future cosmological applications.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent expansion and field-theoretic renormalization group for a singular nonlinear diffusion equation with anomalous scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of self-consistent expansions is a powerful tool for handling strong coupling problems that might otherwise be beyond the reach of perturbation theory, providing surprisingly accurate approximations even at low order. First applied in its embryonic form to fully-developed turbulence, it has subsequently been successfully applied to a variety of problems that include polymer statistics, interface dynamics and high order perturbation theory for the anharmonic oscillator. Here we show that the self-consistent expansion can be applied to singular perturbation problems arising in the theory of partial differential equations. We demonstrate its application to Barenblatt's nonlinear diffusion equation for porous media filtration, where the long-time asymptotics exhibits anomalous dimensions which can be systematically calculated using the perturbative renormalization group. We find that even the first order self-consistent expansion improves the approximation of the anomalous dimension obtained by the first order perturbative renormalization group, especially in the strong coupling regime. We also develop a field-theoretic framework for deterministic partial differential equations to facilitate the application of self-consistent expansions to other dynamic systems, and illustrate its application using the example of Barenblatt's equation. The scope of our results on the combination of renormalization group and self-consistent expansions is limited to partial differential equations whose long-time asymptotics is controlled by incomplete similarity. However, our work suggests that these methods could be applied to a broader suite of singular perturbation problems such as boundary layer theory, multiple scales analysis and matched asymptotic expansions, for which excellent approximations using renormalization group methods alone are already available.</description>

      <title>Topological winding guaranteed coherent orthogonal scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control has enabled various novel phenomena in wave scattering. We introduce an effect called coherent orthogonal scattering, where the output wave becomes orthogonal to the reference output state without scatterers. This effect leads to a unity extinction coefficient and complete mode conversion. We examine the conditions for this effect and reveal its topological nature by relating it to the indivisibility between the dimension and the winding number of scattering submatrices. These findings deepen our understanding of topological scattering phenomena.</description>

      <title>Viscous Instabilities in Transversely Strained Channel Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate here linear stability in a canonical three-dimensional boundary layer generated by the superposition of a spanwise pressure gradient upon an otherwise standard channel flow. As the main result, we introduce a simple coordinate transformation that enables the complete description of modal and non-modal stability using previous results on Poiseuille flow. We leverage this insight to derive closed forms for some relevant stability metrics. In particular, the critical Reynolds number for exponential-in-time growth is found to monotonically decrease with the strength of the cross-flow. A suitably chosen re-scaling, however, shows that the stability characteristics ultimately approach those of channel flow, despite the presence of a non-zero spanwise shear. Unstable eigenmodes akin to the Tollmien-Schlichting wave are found to propagate along the direction of the net flow. From a non-modal perspective, the maximal transient (algebraic) growth increases quadratically with the spanwise pressure differential and, similar to two-dimensional flows, is fueled by the lift-up effect. In this regard, the linear energy budget highlights a dramatic increase in energy production against the spanwise shear.</description>

      <title>Semi-definite optimization of the measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels find operational significance in quantum information theory as achievable error rates in hypothesis testing tasks. They are of interest in the near term, as they correspond to hybrid quantum-classical strategies with technological requirements far less challenging to implement than required by the most general strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we prove that these measured relative entropies can be calculated efficiently by means of semi-definite programming, by making use of variational formulas for the measured relative entropies of states and semi-definite representations of the weighted geometric mean and the operator connection of the logarithm. Not only do the semi-definite programs output the optimal values of the measured relative entropies of states and channels, but they also provide numerical characterizations of optimal strategies for achieving them, which is of significant practical interest for designing hypothesis testing protocols.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Quantization of Modified Maxwell Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified Maxwell electrodynamics, or ModMax for short, is the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's theory that preserves its notable symmetries: conformal invariance and electromagnetic duality. ModMax has been studied extensively at the classical level, however remains largely untouched in a quantum context due to its non-analytic nature.
  In this thesis, we perform the perturbative quantization of this theory. Using the background field method and dimensional regularization, we obtain novel corrections by calculating the one loop quantum effective action. These corrections vanish in a background with constant field strength, and are not of the form of the classical theory for a general background field. Motivated by the corrections obtained for ModMax, we applied the method developed to quantize ModMax to its two dimensional analogue theory. We similarly obtain the one loop quantum effective action for this theory in a general background by evaluating all one loop Feynman diagrams. In addition, we study the divergence of the separate infinite series of two vertex diagrams.</description>

      <title>A new class of non-Einstein pp-wave solutions to quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a new family of exact vacuum solutions to quadratic gravity that describe pp-waves with two-dimensional wave surfaces that can have any prescribed constant curvature. When the wave surfaces are flat we recover the Peres waves obtained by Madsen, a subset of which forms precisely the vacuum pp-waves of general relativity. If, on the other hand, the wave surfaces have non-vanishing constant curvature then all our solutions are non-Einstein (i.e. they do not solve Einstein's equations in vacuum, with or without cosmological constant) and we find that the curvature is linearly related to the value of the cosmological constant. We show that the vacuum field equations reduce to a simple linear biharmonic equation on the curved wave surfaces, and as consequence, the general solution can be written down. We also provide some simple explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the equilibrium for the free boundary problem of a compressible atmospheric primitive model with physical vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the free boundary problem of the compressible primitive equations in atmospheric dynamics with physical vacuum. Up to second order of the perturbations of an equilibrium, we have introduced a model of the compressible primitive equations with a specific viscosity and shown that the physical vacuum free boundary problem for this model system has a global-in-time solution converging to an equilibrium exponentially, provided that the initial data is a small perturbation of the equilibrium. More precisely, we introduce a new coordinate system by choosing the enthalpy (the square of sound speed) as the vertical coordinate, and thanks to the hydrostatic balance, the degenerate density at the free boundary admits a representation with separation of variables in the new coordinates. Such a property allows us to establish horizontal derivative estimates without involving the singular vertical derivative of the density profile, which plays a key role in our analysis.</description>

Abstract: Let $(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{U}^\imath)$ be a split affine quantum symmetric pair of type $\mathsf{B}_n^{(1)}, \mathsf{C}_n^{(1)}$ or $\mathsf{D}_n^{(1)}$. We prove factorization and coproduct formulae for the Drinfeld-Cartan operators $\Theta_i(z)$ in the Lu-Wang Drinfeld-type presentation, generalizing the type $\mathsf{A}_n^{(1)}$ result from [Prz23]. As an application, we show that a boundary analogue of the $q$-character map, defined via the spectra of these operators, is compatible with the usual $q$-character map. As an auxiliary result, we also produce explicit reduced expressions for the fundamental weights in the extended affine Weyl groups of classical types.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic solutions to KZ equations, ordinary crystals, and $p^s$-hypergeometric solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the KZ connection associated with a family of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over the ring of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Then the dual connection is the Gauss-Manin connection of that family. We observe that the Gauss-Manin connection has an ordinary $F$-crystal structure and its unit root subcrystal is of rank $g$. We prove that all local flat sections of the KZ connection annihilate the unite root subcrystal, and the space of all local flat sections of the KZ connection is a free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module of rank $g$. We also consider the reduction modulo $p^s$ of the unit root subcrystal for any $s\geq 1$. We prove that its annihilator is generated by the so-called $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections of the KZ connection. In particular, that means that the reduction modulo $p^s$ of an arbitrary local flat section of the KZ connection over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a linear combination of the $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections.</description>

Abstract: Fractional Gaussian fields are scalar-valued random functions or generalized functions on an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, indexed by a parameter $s$. They include white noise ($s = 0$), Brownian motion ($s=1, n=1$), the 2D Gaussian free field ($s = 1, n=2$) and the membrane model ($s = 2$). These simple objects are ubiquitous in math and science, and can be used as a starting point for constructing non-Gaussian theories.
  The $\textit{differential form}$ analogs of these objects are equally natural: for example, instead of considering an instance $h(x)$ of the GFF on $\mathbb R^2$, one might write $h_1(x)dx_1 + h_2(x) dx_2$ where $h_1$ and $h_2$ are independent GFF instances.
  In general, given $k \in \{0,1,\ldots,n\}$, an instance of the $\textit{fractional Gaussian $k$-form}$ with parameter $s \in \mathbb R$ (abbreviated $\mathrm{FGF}_s^k(M)$) is given by $(-\Delta)^{-\frac{s}{2}} W_k,$ where $W_k$ is a $k$-form-valued white noise. We write $$\textrm{FGF}_s^k(M)_{d=0} \quad \textrm{and} \quad \textrm{FGF}_s^k(M)_{d^*=0}$$ for the $L^2$ orthogonal projections of $\textrm{FGF}_s^k(M)$ onto the space of $k$-forms on which $d$ (resp.\ $d^*$) vanishes. We explain how $\mathrm{FGF}_s^k(M)$ and its projections transform under $d$ and $d^*$, as well as wedge/Hodge-star operators, subspace restrictions, and axial projections.
  We discuss how the $1$-form $\textrm{FGF}_1^1(M)$ and its $\textit{gauge-fixed}$ projection $\textrm{FGF}_1^1(M)_{d^*=0}$ are related to gauge theories, and we formulate several conjectures and open problems about scaling limits, including possible off-critical/non-Gaussian limits, whose construction in the Yang-Mills setting is a famous open problem.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Lommel functions $s_{\mu,\nu}(z)$ for different values of the parameters $(\mu,\nu)$. We show that if $(\mu,\nu)$ are half integers, then it is possible to describe these functions with an explicit combination of polynomials and trigonometric functions. The polynomials turn out to give Pad\'e approximants for the trigonometric functions. Numerical properties of the zeros of the polynomials are discussed. Also, when $\mu$ is an integer, $s_{\mu,\nu}(z)$ can be written as an integral involving an explicit combination of trigonometric functions. A closed formula for $_2F_1\left(\frac{1}{2}+\nu,\frac{1}{2}-\nu;\mu+\frac{1}{2};\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})^2\right)$ with $\mu$ an integer is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete and rigorous derivation of the mechanical energy for twisted 2D bilayer heterostructures without any approximation beyond the existence of an empirical many-body site energy. Our results apply to both the continuous and discontinuous continuum limit. Approximating the intralayer Cauchy-Born energy by linear elasticity theory and assuming an interlayer coupling via pair potentials, our model reduces to a modified Allen-Cahn functional. We rigorously control the error, and, in the case of sufficiently smooth lattice displacements, provide a rate of convergence for twist angles satisfying a Diophantine condition.</description>

      <title>Slow propagation velocities in Schr\"odinger operators with large periodic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger operators with periodic potential have generally been shown to exhibit ballistic transport. In this work, we investigate if the propagation velocity, while positive, can be made arbitrarily small by a suitable choice of the periodic potential. We consider the discrete one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator $\Delta+\mu V$, where $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian, $V$ is a $p$-periodic non-degenerate potential, and $\mu&gt;0$. We establish a Lieb-Robinson-type bound with a group velocity that scales like $\mathcal{O}(1/\mu)$ as $\mu\rightarrow\infty$. This shows the existence of a linear light cone with a maximum velocity of quantum propagation that is decaying at a rate proportional to $1/\mu$. Furthermore, we prove that the asymptotic velocity, or the average velocity of the time-evolved state, exhibits a decay proportional to $\mathcal{O}(1/\mu^{p-1})$ as $\mu\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <title>General characterisation of Hamiltonians generating velocity-independent forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamics generated from Hamiltonians enjoy potential pathways to quantisation, but standard Hamiltonians are only capable of generating conservative forces. Classes of Hamiltonians have been proposed in Berry et al. capable of generating non-conservative velocity-independent forces. Such Hamiltonians have been classified in the past, under the strict assumption that they are polynomial in momentum. This assumption is relaxed here to analyticity. In doing so, broader classes of Hamiltonians are discovered.
  By considering the Hamiltonian as a function of state space without introducing the Lagrangian and constructing a metric-like tensor, we develop strong general constraints on Hamiltonians generating velocity-independent forces and exhibit a surprising dichotomy between classes of such Hamiltonians. These results are applicable to any spatial domain of any dimension admitting well-defined Hamiltonian dynamics. As an example application, we apply these constraints to classify all Hamiltonian velocity-independent forces in two spatial dimensions, as well as all such Hamiltonians which do not generate an isotropic simple harmonic motion. The case of one spatial dimension is also discussed for the sake of completeness.</description>

Abstract: The paper deals with the semi-Dirac operator in a half-space arising in the description of quasiparticles in quantum mechanics as well as in semi-metals materials and related structures. It completely shows the self-adjointness, computes the square and the spectrum of the operator. We also set up sufficient conditions for the existence of the point and discrete spectrum by including some appropriate potentials in the problem and study the spectral stability properties for perturbed operators.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of the Mayer Series Coefficients for a Dimer Gas on a Rectangular Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05388v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues and complements the research in the earlier version of this paper
  (essentially Part 3 and Part 4 herein.) We now assume as suggested at the end of Part 4 that $b(n)$ is asymptotically of the form in eq.(A1).
  \begin{equation}\label{A1} \tag{A1}
  (-1)^{n+1} * b(n) \sim \exp{( k_{-1} n + k_{0} ln(n) + \frac{k_{1}}{n} + \frac{k_{2}}{n^{2}}...)} \end{equation} Using the details of the six approximations used in Part 3, corresponding to the six values of $r$, $ 1 \leq r \leq 6$, in dimensions $d$ equal $2$. $3$, $5$, $11$ and $20$ we find in Part 1 an approximate value for the right side of eq.(A1) keeping the three terms in the exponent in $k_{-1}$, $k_{0}$, and $k_{1}$. In the range $5 \leq n \leq 20$ the two sides of eq.(A1) may be said to agree roughly to 5 parts per 100. ( With an appropriate choice of a constant of proportionality. )
  In Part 2 an approximation is found keeping the term in $k_{2}$ also that may be said to agree to 5 parts in 1000 in the range $8 \leq n \leq 20$. Not only is it amazing that the relation in eq.(A1) seems to hold, it is equally amazing that it is so accurate for such small values of $n$.</description>

      <title>Reliability Function of Quantum Information Decoupling via the Sandwiched R\'enyi Divergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information decoupling is a fundamental quantum information processing task, which also serves as a crucial tool in a diversity of topics in quantum physics. In this paper, we characterize the reliability function of catalytic quantum information decoupling, that is, the best exponential rate under which perfect decoupling is asymptotically approached. We have obtained the exact formula when the decoupling cost is below a critical value. In the situation of high cost, we provide meaningful upper and lower bounds. This result is then applied to quantum state merging, exploiting its inherent connection to decoupling. In addition, as technical tools, we derive the exact exponents for the smoothing of the conditional min-entropy and max-information, and we prove a novel bound for the convex-split lemma. Our results are given in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence, providing it with a new type of operational meaning in characterizing how fast the performance of quantum information tasks approaches the perfect.</description>

Abstract: We perform a variational analysis of an elastic membrane spanning a closed curve which may sustain bending and torsion. First, we deal with parametrized curves and linear elastic membranes proving the existence of equilibria and finding first-order necessary conditions for minimizers computing the first variation. Second, we study a more general case, both for the boundary curve and for the membrane, using the framed curve approach. The infinite dimensional version of the Lagrange multipliers' method is applied to get the first-order necessary conditions. Finally, a numerical approach is presented and employed in several numerical test cases.</description>

      <title>Strong Converse Exponent for Entanglement-Assisted Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the exact strong converse exponent for entanglement-assisted classical communication of a quantum channel. Our main contribution is the derivation of an upper bound for the strong converse exponent which is characterized by the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence. It turns out that this upper bound coincides with the lower bound of Gupta and Wilde (Commun. Math. Phys. 334:867-887, 2015). Thus, the strong converse exponent follows from the combination of these two bounds. Our result has two implications. Firstly, it implies that the exponential bound for the strong converse property of quantum-feedback-assisted classical communication, derived by Cooney, Mosonyi and Wilde (Commun. Math. Phys. 344:797-829, 2016), is optimal. This answers their open question in the affirmative. Hence, we have determined the exact strong converse exponent for this problem as well. Secondly, due to an observation of Leung and Matthews, it can be easily extended to deal with the transmission of quantum information under the assistance of entanglement or quantum feedback, yielding similar results. The above findings provide, for the first time, a complete operational interpretation to the channel's sandwiched R\'enyi information of order $\alpha &gt; 1$.</description>

Abstract: Equations of a heavy rotating body with one fixed point can be deduced starting from a variational problem with holonomic constraints. When applying this formalism to the particular case of a Lagrange top, in the formulation with a diagonal inertia tensor the potential energy has more complicated form as compared with that assumed in the literature on dynamics of a rigid body. This implies the corresponding improvements in equations of motion. Therefore, we revised this case, presenting several examples of analytical solutions to the improved equations. The case of precession without nutation has a surprisingly rich relationship between the rotation and precession rates, and this is discussed in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Level statistics is a crucial tool in the exploration of localization physics. The level spacing distribution of the disordered localized phase follows Poisson statistics, and many studies naturally apply it to the quasiperiodic localized phase. Here we analytically obtain the level spacing distribution of the quasiperiodic localized phase, and find that it deviates from Poisson statistics. Moreover, based on this level statistics, we derive the ratio of adjacent gaps and find that for a single sample, it is a $\delta$ function, which is in excellent agreement with numerical studies. Additionally, unlike disordered systems, in quasiperiodic systems, there are variations in the level spacing distribution across different regions of the spectrum, and increasing the size and increasing the sample are non-equivalent. Our findings carry significant implications for the reevaluation of level statistics in quasiperiodic systems and a profound understanding of the distinct effects of quasiperiodic potentials and disorder induced localization.</description>

      <title>Lower bound for large transversal fluctuations in exactly solvable KPZ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of transversal fluctuation of the optimal path has been a crucial aspect of the Kadar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In this paper, we establish a new probability lower bound, with optimal exponential order, for the rare event in which a given level of the optimal path has a large transversal fluctuation. We present our results in both zero and positive temperature settings. The previously known lower bounds were obtained in zero temperature models, and they hold for the maximum transversal fluctuation along the entire geodesic (Hammond-Sarkar'20) or the starting portion of the geodesic at a local scale (Agarwal'23). Our result improves upon these as now the rare event can demand where the large fluctuation occurs exactly along the optimal path, on both local and global scales. Our proof utilizes the coupling method: we first obtain a version of the estimate in the semi-infinite setting using duality and then transfer the result to finite paths using planar monotonicity. Our method differs from the previous works (Agarwal'23, Hammond-Sarkar'20), and in fact, we do not require fine information about the left tail moderate deviation, which played a crucial role in (Agarwal'23, Hammond-Sarkar'20).</description>

      <title>Multirate Time-Integration based on Dynamic ODE Partitioning through Adaptively Refined Meshes for Compressible Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta (P-ERK) schemes by Vermeire et. al. (2019, 2022) to dynamically partitioned systems arising from adaptive mesh refinement. The P-ERK schemes enable multirate time-integration with no changes in the spatial discretization methodology, making them readily implementable in existing codes that employ a method-of-lines approach.
  We show that speedup compared to a range of state of the art Runge-Kutta methods can be realized, despite additional overhead due to the dynamic re-assignment of flagging variables and restricting nonlinear stability properties. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated for a range of simulation setups for viscous and inviscid convection-dominated compressible flows for which we provide a reproducibility repository.
  In addition, we perform a thorough investigation of the nonlinear stability properties of the Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes regarding limitations due to the violation of monotonicity properties of the underlying spatial discretization. Furthermore, we present a novel approach for estimating the relevant eigenvalues of large Jacobians required for the optimization of stability polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We combine Hilbert module and algebraic techniques to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an Hermitian torsion-free connection on the bimodule of differential one-forms of a first order differential calculus. In the presence of the extra structure of a bimodule connection, we give sufficient conditions for uniqueness. We prove that any $\theta$-deformation of a compact Riemannian manifold admits a unique Hermitian torsion-free bimodule connection and provide an explicit construction of it. Specialising to classical Riemannian manifolds yields a novel construction of the Levi-Civita connection on the cotangent bundle.</description>

Abstract: Using the Levi-Civita connection on the noncommutative differential one-forms of a spectral triple $(\B,\H,\D)$, we define the full Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci curvature tensor and scalar curvature. We give a definition of Dirac spectral triples and derive a general Weitzenbock formula for them. We apply these tools to $\theta$-deformations of compact Riemannian manifolds. We show that the Riemann and Ricci tensors transform naturally under $\theta$-deformation, whereas the connection Laplacian, Clifford representation of the curvature and the scalar curvature are all invariant under deformation.</description>

      <title>The complete exterior spacetime of spherical Brans-Dicke stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the complete expression for the Brans Class I exterior spacetime explicitly in terms of the energy and pressures profiles of a stationary spherisymmetric gravity source. This novel and generic expression is achieved in a parsimonious manner, requiring only a subset of the Brans-Dicke field equation and the scalar equation. For distant orbiting test particles, this expression promptly provides a simple, closed and exact formula of the [textgreek]&lt;LaTeX&gt;\textgreek{g}&lt;/LaTeX&gt; Eddington parameter, which reads {\gamma}_{exact}=(({\omega}+1+({\omega}+2){\Theta})/({\omega}+2+({\omega}+1){\Theta})), where {\Theta} is the ratio of the star's "total pressure" integral over its energy integral. This non-perturbative result reproduces the usual Post-Newtonian (({\omega}+1)/({\omega}+2)) expression in the case of a "Newtonian star", in which the pressure is negligible with respect to the energy density. Furthermore, it converges to the General Relativity value ({\gamma}_{GR}=1) as the star's equation of state approaches that of ultra-relativistic matter (in which case {\Theta} approaches 1), a behavior consistent with broader studies on scalar-tensor gravity. Our derivation underscores the essence of these results involving (1) the key relevant portion of the Brans-Dicke field equations, (2) the uniqueness of the Brans Class I vacuum solution for the non-phantom action, viz. {\omega}&gt;-3/2, and (3) the involvement of only two free parameters in this solution, hence requiring two quantities (energy and pressure integrals) of the mass source to fully characterize the solution. From a practical standpoint, it elucidates how a given stellar interior structure model determines the star's exterior gravitational field and impacts the motions of light objects (such as planets and accretion disks) orbiting it.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a constant factor. Taking a scaling limit, we prove a similar result for functions $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: {\Bbb R}^n \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ that are 1-Lipschitz in the $\ell^1$ metric of ${\Bbb R}^n$ and where the expectation is taken with respect to the standard Gaussian measure in ${\Bbb R}^n$. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>

      <title>Porosity and topological properties of triply periodic minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triple periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) have garnered significant interest due to their structural efficiency and controllable geometry, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. This paper investigates the relationships between porosity and persistence entropy with the shape factor of TPMS. We propose conjectures suggesting that these relationships are polynomial in nature, derived through the application of machine learning techniques. This study exemplifies the integration of machine learning methodologies in pure mathematical research. Besides the conjectures, we provide the mathematical models that might have the potential implications for the design and modeling of TPMS structures in various practical applications.</description>
