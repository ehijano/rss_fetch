      <title>Collective dynamics of active dumbbells near a circular obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the collective dynamics of active dumbbells in the presence of a static circular obstacle using Brownian dynamics simulation. The active dumbbells aggregate on the surface of a circular obstacle beyond a critical radius. The aggregation is non-uniform along the circumference, and the aggregate size increases with the activity and the curvature radius. The dense aggregate of active dumbbells displays persistent rotational motion with a certain angular speed, which linearly increases with the activity. Further, we show the strong polar ordering of the active dumbbells within the aggregate. The polar ordering exhibits a long-range correlation, with the correlation length corresponding to the aggregate size. Additionally, we show that the residence time of an active dumbbell on the obstacle surface grows rapidly with area fraction due to many-body interactions that lead to a slowdown of the rotational diffusion. The article further considers the dynamical behavior of a tracer particle in the solution of active dumbbells. Interestingly, the speed of the passive tracer particle displays a crossover from monotonically decreasing to increasing with the tracer particle's size upon increasing the dumbbells' speed. Furthermore, the effective diffusion of the tracer particle displays the non-monotonic behavior with area fraction; the initial increase of the diffusivity is followed by a decrease for larger area fraction.</description>

      <title>Experimental Modeling of Chiral Active Robots and a Minimal Model of Non-Gaussian Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design 3D-printed motor-driven active particles and find that their dynamics can be characterized using the model of overdamped chiral active Brownian particles (ABPs), as demonstrated by measured angular statistics and translational mean squared displacements (MSDs). Furthermore, we propose a minimal model that reproduces the double-peak velocity distributions and further predicts a transition from the single-peak to the double-peak displacement distributions in short-time regimes. The model provides a clear physics picture of these phenomena, originating from the competition between the active motion and the translational diffusion. Our experiments confirm such picture. The minimal model enhances our understanding of activity-driven non-Gaussian phenomena. The designed particles could be further applied in the study of collective chiral motions.</description>

      <title>Periodic phase-separation during meniscus-guided deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the meniscus-guided coating of a binary fluid mixture containing a solute and a volatile solvent that phase separates via spinodal decomposition. Motivation is the evaporation-driven deposition of material during the fabrication of organic thin film electronics. We find a transition in the phase-separation morphology from an array of droplet-shaped domains deposited periodically parallel to the slot opening to isotropically dispersed solute-rich droplets with increasing coating velocity. This transition originates from the competition between the hydrodynamic injection of the solution into the film and diffusive transport that cannot keep up with replenishing the depletion of solute near the solute-rich domains. The critical velocity separating the two regimes and the characteristic length scale of the phase-separated morphologies are determined by the ratio of two emergent length scales: (i) the spinodal length, which implicitly depends on the evaporation rate and the properties of the solution, and (ii) a depletion length proportional to the ratio of the tracer diffusivity of the solute and the coating velocity. For coating below the critical velocity, an array of droplet-shaped domains is deposited periodically parallel to the slot opening, with the domain size and deposition wavelength proportional to a solute depletion length. As the competition in the mass transport is inherent in any kind of unidirectional deposition of demixing solutions, our findings should apply to a broad range of coating techniques and forced demixing processes.</description>

      <title>Path-based packing of icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for building a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. Our predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations for different systems.</description>

      <title>Energy transduction reconfigures the micro-viscoelasticity of striated muscle myosin solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the high-frequency micro-mechanical response of suspensions composed by cardiac and skeletal muscle myosin by optical trapping interferometry. We observe that in low ionic strength solutions upon the addition of magnesium adenosine triphosphate (MgATP$^{2-}$), myosin suspensions radically change their micro-mechanics properties, generating a viscoelastic fluid characterized by a complex modulus analogous to a suspension of worm-like micelles. This transduction of energy, from chemical to mechanical, may be related to the relaxed states of myosin, which regulate muscle contractility and can be involved in the etiology of many myopathies. Within a similar generic mechanical response, cardiac and skeletal myosin suspensions provide different stress relaxation times, elastic modulus values, and characteristic lengths. These discrepancies probably rely on the dissimilar physiological functions of cardiac and skeletal muscle, on the different MgATPase hydrolysis rates of cardiac and skeletal myosins, and on the observed distinct cooperative behavior of their myosin heads in the super-relaxed state. \textit{In vitro} studies like these allow to understand the foundations of muscle cells mechanics on the micro-scale, and may contribute to the engineering of biological materials whose micro-mechanics can be activated by energy regulators.</description>

      <title>Theory of Capillary Tension and Interfacial Dynamics of Motility-Induced Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statistical mechanics of equilibrium interfaces has been well-established for over a half century. In the last decade, a wealth of observations have made increasingly clear that a new perspective is required to describe interfaces arbitrarily far from equilibrium. In this work, beginning from microscopic particle dynamics that break time-reversal symmetry, we systematically derive the interfacial dynamics of coexisting motility-induced phases. Doing so allows us to identify the athermal energy scale that excites interfacial fluctuations and the nonequilibrium surface tension that resists these excitations. Our theory identifies that, in contrast to equilibrium fluids, this active surface tension contains contributions arising from nonconservative forces which act to suppress interfacial fluctuations and, crucially, is distinct from the mechanical surface tension of Kirkwood and Buff. We find that the interfacial stiffness scales linearly with the intrinsic persistence length of the constituent active particle trajectories, in agreement with simulation data. We demonstrate that at wavelengths much larger than the persistence length, the interface obeys surface area minimizing Boltzmann statistics with our derived nonequilibrium interfacial stiffness playing an identical role to that of equilibrium systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamic structure of lipid domain inclusions embedded within a phase-separated reconstituted lipid bilayer in contact with a swarming flow of gliding filamentous actin. Passive circular domains transition into highly-deformed morphologies that continuously elongate, rotate, and pinch off into smaller fragments, leading to a dynamic steady state with approximately 23x speed up in the relaxation of the intermediate scattering function compared to passive membrane domains driven by purely thermal forces. To corroborate experimental results, we develop a phase-field model of the lipid domains with two-way coupling to the Toner-Tu equations. We report phase domains that become entrained in the chaotic eddy patterns, with oscillating waves of domains that correlate with the dominant wavelengths of the Toner-Tu flow fields.</description>

      <title>Deformation localisation in stretched liquid crystal elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model within the framework of finite elasticity two inherent instabilities observed in liquid crystal elastomers under uniaxial tension. First is necking which occurs when a material sample suddenly elongates more in a small region where it appears narrower than the rest of the sample. Second is shear striping, which forms when the in-plane director rotates gradually to realign and become parallel with the applied force. These phenomena are due to the liquid crystal molecules rotating freely under mechanical loading. To capture necking, we assume that the uniaxial order parameter increases with tensile stretch, as reported experimentally during polydomain-monodomain transition. To account for shear striping, we maintain the uniaxial order parameter fixed, as suggested by experiments. Our finite element simulations capture well these phenomena. As necking in liquid crystal elastomers has not been satisfactorily modelled before, our theoretical and numerical findings related to this effect can be of wide interest. Shear striping has been well studied, yet our computed examples also show how optimal stripe width increases with the nematic penetration depth measuring the competition between the Frank elasticity of liquid crystals and polymer elasticity. Although known theoretically, this result has not been confirmed numerically by previous nonlinear elastic models.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and nonlinear dynamics of the follower force model for active filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biofilament-motor protein complexes are ubiquitous in biology and drive the transport of cargo vital for many fundamental cellular processes. As they move, motor proteins exert compressive forces on the filaments to which they are attached, leading to buckling and a subsequent range of dynamics. The follower force model, in which a single compressive force is imposed at the filament tip, is the standard and most basic model for an elastic filament, such as a microtubule, driven by a motor protein. Depending on the force value, one can observe different states including whirling, beating and writhing, though the bifurcations giving rise to these states are not completely understood. In this paper, we utilise techniques from computational dynamical systems to determine and characterise these bifurcations. We track emerging time-periodic branches and identify new, quasiperiodic states. We investigate the effect of filament slenderness on the bifurcations and, in doing so, present a comprehensive overview of the dynamics which emerge in the follower force model.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Generative Knowledge Extraction, Graph-Based Representation, and Multimodal Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we have transformed a dataset comprising 1,000 scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph. Through an in-depth structural analysis, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities and connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. The graph has an inherently scale-free nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. We compute deep node embeddings for combinatorial node similarity ranking for use in a path sampling strategy links dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's 'Composition VII' painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos/order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections.</description>
