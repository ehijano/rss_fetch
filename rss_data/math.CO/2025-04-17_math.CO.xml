      <title>Laplacian quantum walks on blow-up graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel to the work of Bhattacharjya et al.\ (J. Phys. A-Math. 57.33: 335303, https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ad6653) on quantum state transfer on blow-up graphs, where instead of the adjacency matrix, we take the Laplacian matrix as the time-independent Hamiltonian associated with a blow-up graph. We characterize strong cospectrality, periodicity, perfect state transfer (LPST) and pretty good state transfer (LPGST) on blow-up graphs. We present several constructions of blow-up graphs with LPST and produce new infinite families of regular graphs where each vertex is involved in LPST. We also determine LPST and LPGST in blow-ups of classes of trees. Finally, if $n\equiv 0$ (mod 4), then the blow-up of $n$ copies of a graph $G$ has no LPST, but we show that under certain conditions, the addition of an appropriate matching this blow-up graph results in LPST.</description>

      <title>Leaf-to-leaf paths and cycles in degree-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex graph is degree 3-critical if it has $2n - 2$ edges and no proper induced subgraph with minimum degree at least 3. In 1988, Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Gy\'arf\'as, and Schelp asked whether one can always find cycles of all short lengths in these graphs, which was disproven by Narins, Pokrovskiy, and Szab\'o through a construction based on leaf-to-leaf paths in trees whose vertices have degree either 1 or 3. They went on to suggest several weaker conjectures about cycle lengths in degree 3-critical graphs and leaf-to-leaf path lengths in these so-called 1-3 trees. We resolve three of their questions either fully or up to a constant factor. Our main results are the following:
  - every $n$-vertex degree 3-critical graph has $\Omega(\log n)$ distinct cycle lengths;
  -every tree with maximum degree $\Delta \ge 3$ and $\ell$ leaves has at least $\log_{\Delta-1}\, ((\Delta-2)\ell)$ distinct leaf-to-leaf path lengths;
  - for every integer $N\geq 1$, there exist arbitrarily large 1-3 trees which have $O(N^{0.91})$ distinct leaf-to-leaf path lengths smaller than $N$, and, conversely, every 1-3 tree on at least $2^N$ vertices has $\Omega(N^{2/3})$ distinct leaf-to-leaf path lengths smaller than $N$.
  Several of our proofs rely on purely combinatorial means, while others exploit a connection to an additive problem that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The characterization of graphs with two trivial distance ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distance ideals of graphs are algebraic invariants that generalize the Smith normal form (SNF) and the spectrum of several distance matrices associated with a graph. In general, distance ideals are not monotone under taking induced subgraphs. However, in [7] the characterizations of connected graphs with one trivial distance ideal over $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and over $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ were obtained in terms of induced subgraphs, where $X$ is a set of variables indexed by the vertices. Later, in [3], the first attempt was made to characterize the family of connected graphs with at most two trivial distance ideals over $\mathbb{Z}[X]$. There, it was proven that these graphs are $\{ \mathcal {F},\textsf{odd-holes}_{7}\}$-free, where $\textsf{odd-holes}_{7}$ consists of the odd cycles of length at least seven and $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of sixteen graphs. Here, we give a characterization of the $\{\mathcal{F},\textsf{odd-holes}_{7}\}$-free graphs and prove that the $\{\mathcal{F},\textsf{odd-holes}_{7}\}$-free graphs are precisely the graphs with at most two trivial distance ideals over $\mathbb{Z}[X]$. As byproduct, we also find that the determinant of the distance matrix of a connected bipartite graph is even, this suggests that it is possible to extend, to connected bipartite graphs, the Graham-Pollak-Lov\'asz celebrated formula $\det(D(T_{n+1}))=(-1)^nn2^{n-1}$, and the Hou-Woo result stating that $\text{SNF}(D(T_{n+1}))=\textsf{I}_2\oplus 2\textsf{I}_{n-2}\oplus (2n)$, for any tree $T_{n+1}$ with $n+1$ vertices. Finally, we also give the characterizations of graphs with at most two trivial distance ideals over $\mathbb{Q}[X]$, and the graphs with at most two trivial distance univariate ideals.</description>

      <title>The Topological Structures of the Orders of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide first a categorical exploration of, and then completion of the mapping of the relationships among, three fundamental perspectives on binary relations: as the incidence matrices of hypergraphs, as the formal contexts of concept lattices, and as specifying topological cosheaves of simplicial (Dowker) complexes on simplicial (Dowker) complexes. We provide an integrative, functorial framework combining previously known with three new results: 1) given a binary relation, there are order isomorphisms among the bounded edge order of the intersection complexes of its dual hypergraphs and its concept lattice; 2) the concept lattice of a context is an isomorphism invariant of the Dowker cosheaf (of abstract simplicial complexes) of that context; and 3) a novel Dowker cosheaf (of chain complexes) of a relation is an isomorphism invariant of the concept lattice of the context that generalizes Dowker's original homological result. We illustrate these concepts throughout with a running example, and demonstrate relationships to past results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic normality of coefficients of P-recursive polynomial sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the asymptotic normality of some famous combinatorial sequences has been the subject of extensive study. However, the methods used to prove the asymptotic normality of various combinatorial sequences differ significantly. In this paper, we present a sufficient condition for establishing the asymptotic normality of the coefficients of a general P-recursive polynomial sequence. Additionally, we provide two examples that illustrate the application of this sufficient condition.</description>

      <title>Dividing sums of cycles in the semiring of functional digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional digraphs are unlabelled finite digraphs where each vertex has exactly one out-neighbor. They are isomorphic classes of finite discrete-time dynamical systems. Endowed with the direct sum and product, functional digraphs form a semiring with an interesting multiplicative structure. For instance, we do not know if the following division problem can be solved in polynomial time: given two functional digraphs $A$ and $B$, does $A$ divide $B$? That $A$ divides $B$ means that there exists a functional digraph $X$ such that $AX$ is isomorphic to $B$, and many such $X$ can exist. We can thus ask for the number of solutions $X$. In this paper, we focus on the case where $B$ is a sum of cycles (a disjoint union of cycles, corresponding to the limit behavior of finite discrete-time dynamical systems). There is then a na\"ive sub-exponential algorithm to compute the non-isomorphic solutions $X$, and our main result is an improvement of this algorithm which has the property to be polynomial when $A$ is fixed. It uses a divide-and-conquer technique that should be useful for further developments on the division problem.</description>

      <title>Neumaier graphs from cyclotomy with small coherent rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using cyclotomy, we construct a new infinite family of Neumaier graphs that includes infinitely many strongly regular graphs. Notably, this family conjecturally contains infinitely many graphs with coherent rank $6$. Our construction also provides the first known examples that answer a question posed by Evans, Goryainov, and Panasenko regarding the existence of Neumaier graphs whose nexus is not a power of $2$. In addition, we show that a construction of Greaves and Koolen yields an infinite family of Neumaier graphs with coherent rank $6$.</description>

      <title>The Gray graph is pseudo 2-factor isomorphic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is pseudo 2-factor isomorphic if all of its 2-factors have the same parity of number of cycles. Abreu et al. [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 98 (2008) 432--442] conjectured that $K_{3,3}$, the Heawood graph and the Pappus graph are the only essentially 4-edge-connected pseudo 2-factor isomorphic cubic bipartite graphs. This conjecture was disproved by Goedgebeur [Discr. Appl. Math. 193 (2015) 57--60] who constructed a counterexample $\mathcal{G}$ (of girth 6) on 30 vertices. Using a computer search, he also showed that this is the only counterexample up to at least 40 vertices and that there are no counterexamples of girth greater than 6 up to at least 48 vertices.
  In this manuscript, we show that the Gray graph -- which has 54 vertices and girth 8 -- is also a counterexample to the pseudo 2-factor isomorphic graph conjecture. Next to the graph $\mathcal{G}$, this is the only other known counterexample. Using a computer search, we show that there are no smaller counterexamples of girth 8 and show that there are no other counterexamples up to at least 42 vertices of any girth. Moreover, we also verified that there are no further counterexamples among the known censuses of symmetrical graphs.
  Recall that a graph is 2-factor Hamiltonian if all of its 2-factors are Hamiltonian cycles. As a by-product of the computer searches performed for this paper, we have verified that the $2$-factor Hamiltonian conjecture of Funk et al. [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 87(1) (2003) 138--144], which is still open, holds for cubic bipartite graphs of girth at least 8 up to 52 vertices, and up to 42 vertices for any girth.</description>

      <title>Undirected edge geography games on grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The undirected edge geography is a two-player combinatorial game on an undirected rooted graph. The players alternatively perform a move consisting of choosing an edge incident to the root vertex, removing the chosen edge, and marking the other endpoint as a new root vertex. The first player who cannot perform a move is the loser. In this paper, we are interested in the undirected edge geography game on the grid graph $P_m\square P_n$. We completely determine whether the root vertex is a winning position (N-position) or a losing position (P-position). Moreover, we give a winning strategy for the winner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the length of {\em ordered loose paths} in the random $r$-uniform hypergraph $H=H^{(r)}(n, p)$. A ordered loose path is a sequence of edges $E_1,E_2,\ldots,E_\ell$ where $\max\{j\in E_i\}=\min\{j\in E_{i+1}\}$ for $1\leq i&lt;\ell$. We establish fairly tight bounds on the length of the longest ordered loose path in $H$ that hold with high probability.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Hyperplane Arrangements: Algebra, Combinatorics, and its Geometric Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an affine hyperplane arrangement, $L(\mathcal{A})$ its intersection poset, and $\chi_{\mathcal{A}}(t)$ its characteristic polynomial. This paper aims to find combinatorial conditions for the factorization of $\chi_{\mathcal{A}}(t)$ and investigate corresponding algebraic interpretations. To this end, we introduce the concept of ideal decomposition in a finite ranked meet-semilattice. Notably, it extends two celebrated concepts: modular element proposed by Stanley in 1971 and nice partition proposed by Terao in 1992.
  The main results are as follows. An ideal decomposition of $L(\mathcal{A})$ leads to a factorization of its characteristic polynomial $\chi_{\mathcal{A}}(t)$, which is an extension of Terao's factorization under a nice partition. A special type of two-part ideal decomposition, modular ideal, is studied, which extends Stanley's factorization to affine hyperplane arrangements. We also show that any modular ideal of $L(\mathcal{A})$ has a geometric realization. Moreover, we extend Terao's factorization of the Orlik-Solomon algebra for central arrangements, originally induced by modular elements, to arbitrary affine hyperplane arrangements via the modular ideals.</description>

      <title>Set families: restricted distances via restricted intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denote by $f_D(n)$ the maximum size of a set family $\mathcal{F}$ on $[n] = \{1, \dots, n\}$ with distance set $D$. That is, $|A \bigtriangleup B| \in D$ holds for every pair of distinct sets $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$. Kleitman's celebrated discrete isodiametric inequality states that $f_D(n)$ is maximized at Hamming balls of radius $d/2$ when $D = \{1, \dots, d\}$. We study the generalization where $D$ is a set of arithmetic progression and determine $f_D(n)$ asymptotically for all homogeneous $D$. In the special case when $D$ is an interval, our result confirms a conjecture of Huang, Klurman, and Pohoata. Moreover, we demonstrate a dichotomy in the growth of $f_D(n)$, showing linear growth in $n$ when $D$ is a non-homogeneous arithmetic progression. Different from previous combinatorial and spectral approaches, we deduce our results by converting the restricted distance problems to restricted intersection problems.
  Our proof ideas can be adapted to prove upper bounds on $t$-distance sets in Hamming cubes (also known as binary $t$-codes), which has been extensively studied by algebraic combinatorialists community, improving previous bounds from polynomial methods and optimization approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planes are familiar mathematical objects which lie at the subtle boundary between continuous geometry and discrete combinatorics. A plane is geometrical, certainly, but the ways that two planes can interact break cleanly into discrete sets: the planes can intersect or not. Here we review how oriented matroids can be used to try to capture the combinatorial aspect, giving a way to encode with finite sets all the ways that $n$ planes can interact. We mention how the one-to-one correspondence breaks down in 2 dimensions for 9 lines, and in 3D for 8 planes. We include illustrations of all the types of plane arrangements using $n=4$ and 5.</description>

      <title>Admissible matchings and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of square-free powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $I$ be any square-free monomial ideal, and $\mathcal{H}_I$ denote the hypergraph associated with $I$. Refining the concept of $k$-admissible matching of a graph defined by Erey and Hibi, we introduce the notion of generalized $k$-admissible matching for any hypergraph. Using this, we give a sharp lower bound on the (Castelnuovo-Mumford) regularity of $I^{[k]}$, where $I^{[k]}$ denotes the $k^{\text{th}}$ square-free power of $I$. In the special case when $I$ is equigenerated in degree $d$, this lower bound can be described using a combinatorial invariant $\mathrm{aim}(\mathcal{H}_I,k)$, called the $k$-admissible matching number of $\mathcal{H}_I$. Specifically, we prove that $\mathrm{reg}(I^{[k]})\ge (d-1)\mathrm{aim}(\mathcal{H}_I,k)+k$, whenever $I^{[k]}$ is non-zero. Even for the edge ideal $I(G)$ of a graph $G$, it turns out that $\mathrm{aim}(G,k)+k$ is the first general lower bound for the regularity of $I(G)^{[k]}$. In fact, when $G$ is a forest, $\mathrm{aim}(G,k)$ coincides with the $k$-admissible matching number introduced by Erey and Hibi. Next, we show that if $G$ is a block graph, then $\mathrm{reg}(I(G)^{[k]})= \mathrm{aim}(G,k)+k$, and this result can be seen as a generalization of the corresponding regularity formula for forests. Additionally, for a Cohen-Macaulay chordal graph $G$, we prove that $\mathrm{reg}(I(G)^{[2]})= \mathrm{aim}(G,2)+2$. Finally, we propose a conjecture on the regularity of square-free powers of edge ideals of chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Computation of dominant ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining whether a monomial ideal is dominant. This property is critical for determining for which monomial ideals the Taylor resolution is minimal. We first analyze dominant ideals with a fixed least common multiple of generators using combinatorial methods. Then, we adopt a probabilistic approach via the \er\ type model, examining both homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases. This model offers an efficient alternative to exhaustive enumeration, allowing the study of dominance through small random samples, even in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Tangled Paths: A Random Graph Model from Mallows Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04786v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the random graph $\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ which results from taking the union of two paths of length $n\geq 1$, where the vertices of one of the paths have been relabelled according to a Mallows permutation with parameter $0&lt;q(n)\leq 1$. This random graph model, the tangled path, goes through an evolution: if $q$ is close to $0$ the graph bears resemblance to a path, and as $q$ tends to $1$ it becomes an expander. In an effort to understand the evolution of $\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ we determine the treewidth and cutwidth of $\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ up to log factors for all $q$. We also show that the property of having a separator of size one has a sharp threshold. In addition, we prove bounds on the diameter, and vertex isoperimetric number for specific values of $q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cop-width and flip-width are new families of graph parameters introduced by Toru\'nczyk (2023) that generalise treewidth, degeneracy, generalised colouring numbers, clique-width and twin-width. In this paper, we bound the cop-width and flip-width of a graph by its strong colouring numbers. In particular, we show that for every $r\in \mathbb{N}$, every graph $G$ has $\text{copwidth}_r(G)\leq \text{scol}_{4r}(G)$. This implies that every class of graphs with linear strong colouring numbers has linear cop-width and linear flip-width. We use this result to deduce improved bounds for cop-width and flip-width for various sparse graph classes.</description>

Abstract: The $d$-dimensional hypercube graph $Q_d$ has as vertices all subsets of $\{1,\ldots,d\}$, and an edge between any two sets that differ in a single element. The Ruskey-Savage conjecture asserts that every matching of $Q_d$, $d\ge 2$, can be extended to a Hamilton cycle, i.e., to a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. We prove that every matching of $Q_d$, $d\ge 2$, can be extended to a cycle that visits at least a $2/3$-fraction of all vertices.</description>

      <title>Weak colourings of Kirkman triple systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $\delta$-colouring of the point set of a block design is said to be {\em weak} if no block is monochromatic. The {\em chromatic number} $\chi(S)$ of a block design $S$ is the smallest integer $\delta$ such that $S$ has a weak $\delta$-colouring. It has previously been shown that any Steiner triple system has chromatic number at least $3$ and that for each $v\equiv 1$ or $3\pmod{6}$ there exists a Steiner triple system on $v$ points that has chromatic number $3$. Moreover, for each integer $\delta \geq 3$ there exist infinitely many Steiner triple systems with chromatic number $\delta$.
  We consider colourings of the subclass of Steiner triple systems which are resolvable. We show that for each $v\equiv 3\pmod{6}$ there exists a Kirkman triple system on $v$ points with chromatic number $3$. We also show that for each integer $\delta \geq 3$, there exist infinitely many Kirkman triple systems with chromatic number $\delta$. We close with several open problems.</description>

      <title>Clonal cores and flexipaths in matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partitioned matroid $(M, \{X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n\})$ consists of a matroid $M$ and a partition $\{X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n\}$ of its ground set. As such structures arise frequently in structural matroid theory, this paper introduces a general technique for analyzing those special properties of partitioned matroids that depend solely on the values of the connectivities $\lambda(X_i)$, the local connectivities $\sqcap(\cup_{j\in J}X_j, \cup_{k\in K}X_k,)$, and the dual local connectivities $\sqcap^*(\cup_{h\in H}X_h, \cup_{g\in G}X_g)$. In particular, we consider those partitioned matroids in which each $X_i$ is an independent, coindependent set of clones of cardinality $\lambda(X_i)$. Calling such partitioned matroids clonal-core matroids, we show that special results of the above type for partitioned matroids can be verified in general by proving them just for clonal-core matroids. Aiming at the long-term goal of finding the unavoidable minors of $4$-connected matroids, we illustrate this technique by studying $4$-paths. These are sequences $(L,P_1,P_2,\ldots, P_n,R)$ of sets that partition the ground set of a matroid so that the union of any proper initial segment of parts is $4$-separating. Viewing the ends $L$ and $R$ as fixed, we call such a partition a $4$-flexipath if $(L,Q_1,Q_2,\ldots, Q_n,R)$ is a $4$-path for all permutations $(Q_1,Q_2,\ldots, Q_n)$ of $(P_1,P_2,\ldots, P_n)$. A straightforward simplification enables us to focus on $(4,c)$-flexipaths for some $c$ in $\{1,2,3\}$, that is, those $4$-flexipaths for which $\lambda(Q_i) = c$ and $\lambda(Q_i \cup Q_j) &gt; c$ for all distinct $i$ and $j$. Our main result for $4$-paths is that the only non-trivial case that arises here is when $c=2$. In that case, there are essentially only two possible dual pairs of $(4,c)$-flexipaths when $n \ge 5$.</description>

      <title>Bound vertices of longest paths between two vertices in cubic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thomassen's chord conjecture from 1976 states that every longest cycle in a $3$-connected graph has a chord. This is one of the most important unsolved problems in graph theory. Let $H$ be a subgraph of a graph $G$. A vertex $v$ of $H$ is said to be $H$-bound if all the neighbors of $v$ in $G$ lie in $H$. Recently, Zhan has made the more general conjecture that in a $k$-connected graph, every longest path $P$ between two vertices contains at least $k-1$ internal $P$-bound vertices. In this paper, we prove that Zhan's conjecture holds for $2$-connected cubic graphs. This conclusion generalizes a result of Thomassen [{\em J. Combin. Theory Ser. B} \textbf{129} (2018) 148--157]. Furthermore, we prove that if the two vertices are adjacent, Zhan's conjecture holds for $3$-connected cubic graphs, from which we deduce that every longest cycle in a $3$-connected cubic graph has at least two chords. This strengthens a result of Thomassen [{\em J. Combin. Theory Ser. B} \textbf{71} (1997) 211--214].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Centraliser algebras of monomial representations of finite groups may be constructed and studied using methods similar to those employed in the study of permutation groups. Guided by results of D. G. Higman and others, we give an explicit construction for a basis of the centraliser algebra of a monomial representation. The character table of this algebra is then constructed via character sums over double cosets. We locate the theory of group-developed and cocyclic-developed Hadamard matrices within this framework. We apply Gr\"obner bases to produce a new classification of highly symmetric complex Hadamard matrices.</description>

      <title>The BBDVW Conjecture for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of lower intervals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blundell, Buesing, Davies, Veli\v{c}kovi\'c, and Williamson (BBDVW) introduced the notion of a hypercube decomposition of an interval in Bruhat order. They conjectured a recursive formula in terms of this structure which, if shown for all intervals, would imply the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture of Lusztig and Dyer, for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of the symmetric group. In this article, we prove implications between the BBDVW Conjecture and several other recurrences for hypercube decompositions, under varying hypotheses, which have appeared in the recent literature. As an application, we prove the BBDVW Conjecture for lower intervals $[e,v]$, the first non-trivial class of intervals for which it has been established.</description>

      <title>A generalisation of bent vectors for Butson Hadamard matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n\times n$ complex matrix $M$ with entries in the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ roots of unity which satisfies $MM^{\ast} = nI_{n}$ is called a Butson Hadamard matrix. While a matrix with entries in the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ roots typically does not have an eigenvector with entries in the same set, such vectors and their generalisations turn out to have multiple applications. A bent vector for $M$ satisfies $M{\bf x} = \lambda {\bf y}$ where ${\bf x}$ has entries in the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ roots of unity and all entries of $\textbf{y}$ are complex numbers of norm $1$. Such a bent vector ${\bf x}$ is self-dual if ${\bf y} = \mu{\bf x}$ and conjugate self-dual if ${\bf y} = \mu\overline{\bf x}$ for some $\mu$ of norm $1$.
  Using techniques from algebraic number theory, we prove some order conditions and non-existence results for self-dual and conjugate self-dual bent vectors; using tensor constructions and Bush-type matrices we give explicit examples. We conclude with an application to the covering radius of certain non-linear codes generalising the Reed Muller codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to diagnose the cause of some defects in the category of canonical hypergroups, we investigate several categories of hyperstructures that generalize hypergroups. By allowing hyperoperations with possibly empty products, one obtains categories with desirable features such as completeness and cocompleteness, free functors, regularity, and closed monoidal structures. We show by counterexamples that such constructions cannot be carried out within the category of canonical hypergroups. This suggests that (commutative) unital, reversible hypermagmas -- which we call mosaics -- form a worthwhile generalization of (canonical) hypergroups from the categorical perspective. Notably, mosaics contain pointed simple matroids as a subcategory, and projective geometries as a full subcategory.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles has the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$, defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$, is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts, since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$, and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Rademacher chaos of low degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resilience of a Rademacher chaos is the maximum number of adversarial sign-flips that the chaos can sustain without having its largest atom probability significantly altered. Inspired by probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of linear Rademacher chaos, obtained by Bandeira, Ferber, and Kwan (Advances in Mathematics, Vol. $319$, $2017$), we provide probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low degree.
  Our main results distinguish between Rademacher chaos of order two and those of higher order. In that, our first main result pertains to the resilience of decoupled bilinear Rademacher forms where different asymptotic behaviour is observed for sparse and dense matrices. For our second main result, we bootstrap our first result in order to provide resilience guarantees for quadratic Rademacher chaos. Our third main result, generalises the first and handles the resilience of decoupled Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low order.
  Our results for decoupled Rademacher chaos of order two and that of higher order whilst are established through the same conceptual framework, differ substantially. A difference incurred due to the implementation of the same conceptual argument. The order two result is established using Dudley's maximal inequality for sub-Gaussian processes, the Hanson-Wright inequality, as well as the Kolmogorov-Rogozin inequality. To handle higher order chaos, appeals to Dudley's inequality as well as the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with tools suited for random tensors. Appeals to the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with appeals to a concentration result for random tensors put forth by Adamczak and Wolff.
  Our results are instance-dependent and thus allow for the efficient computation of resilience guarantees provided the order of the chaos is constant.</description>

      <title>Generic Global Rigidity in $\ell_p$-Space and the Identifiability of the $p$-Cayley-Menger Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated result of Gortler-Healy-Thurston (independently, Jackson-Jord\'an for $d=2$) shows that the global rigidity of graphs realised in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is a generic property. Extending this result to the global rigidity problem in $\ell_p$-spaces remains an open problem. In this paper we affirmatively solve this problem when $d=2$ and $p$ is an even positive integer. A key tool in our proof is a sufficient condition for the $d$-tangential weak non-defectivity of projective varieties due to Bocci, Chiantini, Ottaviani, and Vannieuwenhoven. By specialising the condition to the $p$-Cayley-Menger variety, which is the $\ell_p$-analogue of the Cayley-Menger variety for Euclidean distance, we provide an $\ell_p$-extension of the generic global rigidity theory of Connelly. As a by-product of our proof, we also offer a purely graph-theoretical characterisation of the $2$-identifiability of an orthogonal projection of the $p$-Cayley-Menger variety along a coordinate axis of the ambient affine space.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Shenanigans: Permutons from pipe dreams via integrable probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random permutations arising from reduced pipe dreams. Our main model is motivated by Grothendieck polynomials with parameter $\beta=1$ arising in K-theory of the flag variety. The probability weight of a permutation is proportional to the principal specialization (setting all variables to 1) of the corresponding Grothendieck polynomial. By mapping this random permutation to a version of TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process), we describe the limiting permuton and fluctuations around it as the order $n$ of the permutation grows to infinity. The fluctuations are of order $n^{\frac13}$ and have the Tracy-Widom GUE distribution, which places this algebraic (K-theoretic) model into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.
  We also investigate non-reduced pipe dreams and make progress on a recent open problem on the asymptotic number of inversions of the resulting permutation. Inspired by Stanley's question for the maximal value of principal specializations of Schubert polynomials, we resolve the analogous question for $\beta=1$ Grothendieck polynomials, and provide bounds for general $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Non-Archimedean GUE corners and Hecke modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the joint distribution of singular numbers for all principal corners of a $p$-adic Hermitian (resp. alternating) matrix with additive Haar distribution, the non-archimedean analogue of the GUE (resp. aGUE) corners process. In the alternating case we find that it is a Hall-Littlewood process, explaining -- and recovering as a corollary -- results of Fulman-Kaplan. In the Hermitian case we obtain a `marginal distribution' of a formal Hall-Littlewood process with both positive and negative transition `probabilities'. The proofs relate natural random matrix operations to structural results of Hironaka and Hironaka-Sato on modules over the spherical Hecke algebra, yielding other probabilistic statements of independent interest along the way.</description>

      <title>The Density Finite Sums Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density and any $k\geq 1$, we show the existence of an infinite set $B\subset{\mathbb N}$ and a shift $t\geq0$ such that $A-t$ contains all sums of $m$ distinct elements from $B$ for all $m\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. This can be viewed as a density analog of Hindman's finite sums theorem. Our proof reveals the natural relationships among infinite sumsets, the dynamics underpinning arithmetic progressions, and homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie groups.</description>
