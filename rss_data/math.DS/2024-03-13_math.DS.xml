      <title>Test for amenability for extensions of infinite residually finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group that admits a minimal equicontinuous action on the Cantor set (for example, a residually finite group). We show that the family of almost automorphic actions of $G$ on the Cantor set, is a test for amenability for $G$. More precisely, we show that if $G$ is non-amenable, then for every minimal equicontinuous system $(Y, G)$, such that $Y$ is a Cantor set, there exists a Toeplitz subshift with no invariant probability measures, whose maximal equicontinuous factor is $(Y,G)$. Consequently, we obtain that $G$ is amenable if and only if every Toeplitz $G$-subshift has at least one invariant probability measure.</description>

      <title>Intraspecific and monotone enzyme catalysis with oscillatory substrate and inhibitor supplies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enzyme catalysis in reactors for industrial applications usually require an external intervention of the species for the chemical reactions. We analyze the most elementary open enzyme catalysis with competitive inhibition where a time-dependent inflow of substrate and inhibitor supplies is modeled by almost periodic functions. Under mild conditions we prove global stability of an almost periodic solution for the non-autonomous dynamical system arising from the mass-law action. This predicts a well behaved situation in which the reactor oscillates with global stability.</description>

      <title>Heating from Above in Non-scattering Suspensions: Phototactic Bioconvection under Collimated Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Examining phototactic bioconvection in non-scattering suspensions with upper heating and collimated irradiation, this study delves into the intricate dynamics influenced by light and microorganisms. The study focuses on the linear stability of the basic state, examining neutral curves. The numerical analysis involves solving a system of equations using the MATLAB bvp4c solver. The investigation considers the impact of parameters, such as the thermal Rayleigh number, critical total intensity, and Lewis number, on the critical bioconvection Rayleigh number. As the critical total intensity varies, a transition from a stationary to an oscillatory solution (and vice versa) is observed. Phototactic microorganisms are incorporated into the model, and results show how varying parameters affect convection patterns and stability. The findings reveal interesting phenomena, including Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Data driven approach to study the transition from dispersive to dissipative systems through dimensionality reduction techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complexity is often exhibited in dynamical systems, where certain parameters evolve with time in a strange and chaotic nature. These systems lack predictability and are common in the physical world. Dissipative systems are one of such systems where the volume of the phase space contracts with time. On the other hand, we employ dimensionality reduction techniques to study complicated and complex data, which are tough to analyse. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used as a means to study complex data. Through PCA, we studied the reduced dimensional features of the numerical data generated by a nonlinear partial differential equation called the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation, which is a nonlinear dispersive system, where solitary waves travel along a specific direction with finite amplitude. Dissipative nature, specific to that of the Lorenz system, were observed in the dimensionally reduced data, which implies a transition from a dispersive system to a dissipative system.</description>

      <title>Exploring simplicity bias in 1D dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arguments inspired by algorithmic information theory predict an inverse relation between the probability and complexity of output patterns in a wide range of input-output maps. This phenomenon is known as \emph{simplicity bias}. By viewing the parameters of dynamical systems as inputs, and resulting (digitised) trajectories as outputs, we study simplicity bias in the logistic map, Gauss map, sine map, Bernoulli map, and tent map. We find that the logistic map, Gauss map, and sine map all exhibit simplicity bias upon sampling of map initial values and parameter values, but the Bernoulli map and tent map do not. The simplicity bias upper bound on output pattern probability is used to make \emph{a priori} predictions for the probability of output patterns. In some cases, the predictions are surprisingly accurate, given that almost no details of the underlying dynamical systems are assumed. More generally, we argue that studying probability-complexity relationships may be a useful tool in studying patterns in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Chaos and Regularity in the Double Pendulum with Lagrangian Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we apply the method of Lagrangian descriptors as an indicator to study the chaotic and regular behavior of trajectories in the phase space of the classical double pendulum system. In order to successfully quantify the degree of chaos with this tool, we first derive Hamilton's equations of motion for the problem in non-dimensional form, showing that they can be written compactly using matrix algebra. Once the dynamical equations are obtained, we carry out a parametric study in terms of the system's total energy and the other model parameters (lengths and masses of the pendulums, and gravity), to determine the extent of the chaotic and regular regions in the phase space. Our numerical results show that for a given mass ratio, the maximum chaotic fraction of phase space trajectories is attained when the pendulums have equal lengths. Moreover, we give a characterization of the growth and decay of chaos in the system in terms of the model parameters, and explore the hypothesis that the chaotic fraction follows an exponential law over different energy regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonautonomous periodic chemostat model with delays modelling $n$ species in competition is considered. Sufficient conditions on the coefficients and consumption functions for the species are given, for both the extinction of the species and for the existence of $n$ nontrivial and nonnegative periodic solutions. Further criteria guarantee that the system admits at least one strictly positive periodic solution.</description>

  \beta z^2(\sigma t)+y^2(\beta\sigma t)=\rho x^2(\beta t)+\nu e^{-2\beta\sigma t},
  \]where $\nu\in\mathbb{R}$ is a constant. And we will see some applications of this identity.</description>

      <title>On Uniqueness of Participation Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modal analysis and control of a nonlinear dynamical system, participation factors of state variables with respect to a mode of interest serve as pivotal tools for stability studies. Linear participation factors are uniquely determined by the mode's shape and composition, which are defined by the right and left eigenvectors of the linearized model. For nonlinear participation factors as well as five other variants of participation factors, this paper finds the sufficient conditions for them to be unique against scaling factors on the shape and composition of a mode. Besides, the similarity between the scaling factor and perturbation amplitude is also discussed.</description>

      <title>On non-tameness of the Ellis semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ellis semigroup of a dynamical system $(X,T)$ is tame if every element is the limit of a sequence (as opposed to a net) of homeomorphisms coming from the $T$ action. This topological property is related to the cardinality of the semigroup. Non-tame Ellis semigroups have a cardinality which is that of the power set of the continuum $2^{\mathfrak c}$.The semigroup admits a minimal bilateral ideal and this ideal is a union of isomorphic copies of a group $\mathcal H$, the so-called structure group of $(X,T)$.  For almost automorphic systems the cardinality of $\mathcal H$ is at most $\mathfrak c$, that of the continuum. We show a partial converse for minimal $(X,T)$ with abelian $T$, namely  that the cardinality of the structure group is $2^{\mathfrak c}$ if the proximal relation is not transitive and the subgroup generated by differences of singular points in the maximal equicontinuous factor is not open.This refines the above statement about non-tame Ellis semigroups, as it locates a particular algebraic component of the latter which has such a large cardinality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove new cases of the Hilbert-Smith conjecture for actions by natural homeomorphisms in symplectic topology. Specifically, we prove that the group of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb Z_p$ does not admit non-trivial continuous actions by Hamiltonian homeomorphisms, the $C^0$ limits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, on symplectically aspherical symplectic manifolds. For a class of symplectic manifolds, including all standard symplectic tori, we deduce that a locally compact group acting faithfully by homeomorphisms in the $C^0$ closure of time-one maps of symplectic isotopies must be a Lie group. Our methods of proof differ from prior approaches to the question and involve barcodes and power operations in Floer cohomology. They also apply to other natural metrics in symplectic topology, notably Hofer's metric. An appendix by Leonid Polterovich uses this to deduce obstructions on Hamiltonian actions by semi-simple $p$-adic analytic groups.</description>

      <title>Exploring iterative and non-iterative Fourier series-based methods of control optimization in application to a discontinuous capsule drive model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper explains iterative and non-iterative approaches to control optimization with use of the Fourier series-based method. Both variants of the presented algorithm are used to numerically approximate optimal control of a discontinuous pendulum capsule drive. Firstly, the general algorithm and its two realizations (iterative and non-iterative) are presented. It is shown that the iterative variant assures non-decreasing quality of solutions in subsequent repetitions of the procedure and the background of such guarantees is explained. A numerical example follows: control of a self-propelled capsule drive is optimized using both approaches. Results are compared and discussed. It is expected that the presented methods can be useful in optimal control estimation for complex systems, particularly discontinuous ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic and let $X$ be an irreducible projective variety over $K$. Let $G\subseteq\text{Bir}(X)$ be a bounded-degree subgroup. We prove that there exists an irreducible projective variety $Y$ birational to $X$, such that every element of $G$ becomes an automorphism of $Y$ after the birational transformation. If $K=\mathbb{C}$, this result is stated in [Can14, Theorem 2.5] and the proof backs to [HZ96, Section 5]. The proof in [HZ96] is not purely algebraic. Inheriting the methods in [HZ96], we give a purely algebraic proof of this statement in arbitrary characteristic. We will also discuss a corollary of this result which is useful in arithmetic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence characteristics of dynamics that are \emph{globally weakly} and \emph{locally strongly contracting}. Such dynamics naturally arise in the context of convex optimization problems with a unique minimizer. We show that convergence to the equilibrium is \emph{linear-exponential}, in the sense that the distance between each solution and the equilibrium is upper bounded by a function that first decreases linearly and then exponentially. As we show, the linear-exponential dependency arises naturally in certain dynamics with saturations. Additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for local input-to-state stability. Finally, we illustrate our results on, and propose a conjecture for, continuous-time dynamical systems solving linear programs.</description>

      <title>The frequency problem of the three gap theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three gap theorem was originally a conjecture by Steinhaus, who asserted that there are at most three distinct gap lengths in the fractional parts of the sequence {\alpha},{2}{\alpha},{\cdots},{N}{\alpha} for any integer {N} and real number {\alpha}. This conjecture has been proved by many different methods, and extended to higher dimensional cases. For the three gap theorem, what is the frequence of two gaps or three gaps? On the basis of Ravenstein's work, this paper studies the frequency of the three gap theorem through cake model. We show that for almost all {\alpha\in (0,1)\backslash \mathbb {Q}} in the sence of the Lebesgue measure, the frequency of the two gaps is {0}, in other words, the frequency of the three gaps is {1}. The proof makes full use of the continued fraction expansion of {\alpha}, as well as partial results in the Diophantine approximation. Finally, we illustrate that two gaps occur with a frequency of {0}.</description>

      <title>Time-discretization method for a multi-term time fractional differential equation with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses a multi-term time-fractional delay differential equation in a real Hilbert space. An iterative scheme for a multi-term time-fractional differential equation is established using Rothe's method. The method of semi-discretization is extended to this kind of time fractional problem with delay in the case that the time delay parameter $\nu &gt;0$ satisfies $\nu\leq T$, where $T$ denotes the final time. We apply the accretivity of the operator $A$ in an iterative scheme to establish the existence and regularity of strong solutions to the considered problem. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate the abstract result.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariants for non-compactly supported Hamiltonians on the disc, and an application to the mean action spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a symplectic isotopy on the two-dimensional disc we show that the classical spectral invariants of Viterbo [20] can be extended in a meaningful way to {\it non-compactly} supported Hamiltonians. We establish some basic properties of these extended invariants and as an application we show that Hutchings' inequality in [8] between the Calabi invariant and the mean action spectrum holds without any assumptions on the isotopy; in [8] it is assumed that the Calabi invariant is less than the rotation number (or action) on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Convergence of martingale solutions to the hybrid slow-fast system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.06878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the weak convergence for a slow-fast system with jumps modulated by Markovian switching regimes with the martingale method. However, due to the coexistence of fast component and Markovian switching regimes, the martingale method and perturbed test functions can not be applied directly. In this situation, a combination of perturbed test functions and the time discretization is applied efficiently. And the choice of appropriate perturbed test functions, which are related to the averaged coefficients, plays a decisive role. Our results also cover the case of slow-fast system without Markovian switching regimes. Finally, some examples are presented,and numerical simulations are carried out to observe a good agreement.</description>

      <title>Takagi type functions and dynamical systems: the smoothness of the SBR measure and the existence and smoothness of local time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Takagi-type functions with roughness parameter $\gamma$ that are H\"older continuous with coefficient $H=\frac{\log\gamma}{\log \frac{1}{2}}.$ Analytical access is provided by an embedding into a dynamical system related to the baker transform where the graphs of the functions are identified as their global attractors. They possess stable manifolds hosting Sinai-Bowen-Ruelle (SBR) measures. We identify these measures with the laws of certain symmetric Bernoulli convolutions. Dually, where duality is related to ''time'' reversal, we give a representation of the Takagi-type curves centered around fibers of the associated stable manifold in terms of Bernoulli convolutions. Duality also relates SBR to occupation measure. As opposed to SBR measure - Bernoulli convolutions belong to the first chaos - occupation measure turns out to be a functional in the second Rademacher chaos, in terms of this non-Gaussian Malliavin calculus. Using a Fourier analytic criterion and variants of Weyl's equidistribution theorem, we prove for smoothness parameters $\gamma = 2^{-\frac{1}{m}}, m\in\mathbb{N},$ that the Takagi-type curves possess square integrable local times with $m-2$ smooth derivatives.</description>

Abstract: In this paper I introduce the property CBD which is a more convenient variant of the UC property and show one of the possible relationships between them, I also extend the concept of a fixed point, introducing the concept of a weak fixation of a point about a sequence. I introduce contraction map sets with an external factor and formulate a theorem for them, on which the main focus of this article falls.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviations for two-time scale systems with mixed fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on moderate deviations for two-time scale systems with mixed fractional Brownian motion. Our proof uses the weak convergence method which is based on the variational representation formula for mixed fractional Brownian motion. Throughout this paper, Hurst parameter of fractional Brownian motion is larger than $1/2$ and the integral along the fractional Brownian motion is understood as the generalized Riemann-Stieltjes integral. First, we consider single-time scale systems with fractional Brownian motion. The key of our proof is showing the weak convergence of the controlled system. Next, we extend our method to show moderate deviations for two-time scale systems. To this goal, we combine the Khasminskii-type averaging principle and the weak convergence approach.</description>

      <title>Anosov flows in dimension 3 from gluing building blocks with quasi-transverse boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a new result allowing to construct Anosov flows in dimension 3 by gluing building blocks. By a building block, we mean a compact 3-manifold with boundary $P$, equipped with a $C^1$ vector field $X$, such that the maximal invariant set $\cap_{t \in \mathbb{R}} X^t (P)$ is a saddle hyperbolic set, and the boundary $\partial P$ is quasi-transverse to $X$, i.e. transverse except for a finite number of periodic orbits contained in $\partial P$. Our gluing theorem is a generalization of a recent result of F. B\'eguin, C. Bonatti, and B. Yu who only considered the case where the block does not contain attractors nor repellers, and the boundary $\partial P$ is transverse to $X$. The quasi-transverse setting is much more natural. Indeed, our result can be seen as a counterpart of a theorem by Barbot and Fenley which roughly states that every 3-dimensional Anosov flow admits a canonical decomposition into building blocks (with quasi-transverse boundary). We will also show a number of applications of our theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.08683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on parallels between geometric quantum mechanics and classical mechanics, we explore an alternative basis for quantum thermodynamics that exploits the differential geometry of the underlying state space. We develop both microcanonical and canonical ensembles, introducing continuous mixed states as distributions on the manifold of quantum states. We call out the experimental consequences for a gas of qudits. We define quantum heat and work in an intrinsic way, including single-trajectory work, and reformulate thermodynamic entropy in a way that accords with classical, quantum, and information-theoretic entropies. We give both the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics and Jarzynki's Fluctuation Theorem. The result is a more transparent physics, than conventionally available, in which the mathematical structure and physical intuitions underlying classical and quantum dynamics are seen to be closely aligned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $b\geq2$ be an integer and $A=(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a strictly increasing subsequence of positive integers with $\eta:=\limsup\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}&lt;+\infty$. For each irrational real number $\xi$, we denote by $\hat{v}_{b,A}(\xi)$ the supremum of the real numbers $\hat{v}$ for which, for every sufficiently large integer $N$, the equation $\|b^{a_n}\xi\|&lt;(b^{a_N})^{-\hat{v}}$ has a solution $n$ with $1\leq n\leq N$. For every $\hat{v}\in[0,\eta]$, let $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{b,A}(\hat{v})$ ($\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{b,A}^{\ast}(\hat{v})$) be the set of all real numbers $\xi$ such that $\hat{v}_{b,A}(\xi)\geq\hat{v}$ ($\hat{v}_{b,A}(\xi)=\hat{v}$) respectively. In this paper, we give some results of the Hausdorfff dimensions of $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{b,A}(\hat{v})$ and $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{b,A}^{\ast}(\hat{v})$. When $\eta=1$, we prove that the Hausdorfff dimensions of $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{b,A}(\hat{v})$ and $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{b,A}^{\ast}(\hat{v})$ are equal to $\left(\frac{1-\hat{v}}{1+\hat{v}}\right)^{2}$ for any $\hat{v}\in[0,1]$. When $\eta&gt;1$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}$ exists, we show that the Hausdorfff dimension of $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{b,A}(\hat{v})$ is strictly less than $\left(\frac{\eta-\hat{v}}{\eta+\hat{v}}\right)^{2}$ for some $\hat{v}$, which is different with the case $\eta=1$, and we give a lower bound of the Hausdorfff dimensions of $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{b,A}(\hat{v})$ and $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{b,A}^{\ast}(\hat{v})$ for any $\hat{v}\in[0,\eta]$. Furthermore, we show that this lower bound can be reached for some $\hat{v}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with breather solutions of a radially symmetric curl-curl wave equation with double power nonlinearity. By considering the solutions with a special form, we obtain a family of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterized by the radial variable. Then we characterize periodic behaviors and analyze the joint effects of the double power nonlinear terms on the minimal period and the maximal amplitude. Under certain conditions, we construct a breather solution for the original curl-curl wave equation and find such a solution which can generate a continuum of phase-shifted breathers.</description>

      <title>Invariant rational functions under rational transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic variety equipped with a dominant rational self-map $\phi:X\to X$. A new quantity measuring the interaction of $(X,\phi)$ with trivial dynamical systems is introduced; the stabilised algebraic dimension of $(X,\phi)$ captures the maximum number of new algebraically independent invariant rational functions on the cartesian product of $(X, \phi)$ and $(Y, \psi)$, as $(Y,\psi)$ ranges over all algebraic dynamical systems. It is shown that this birational invariant agrees with the maximum dimension of a dominant equivariant rational image $(X',\phi')$ where $\phi'$ is part of an algebraic group action on $X'$. As a consequence, it is deduced that if some cartesian power of $(X,\phi)$ admits a nonconstant invariant rational function, then already the second cartesian power does.</description>

      <title>Shelukhin's Hofer distance and a symplectic cohomology barcode for contactomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper constructs a persistence module of Floer cohomology groups associated to a contactomorphism of the ideal boundary of a Liouville manifold. The barcode (or, bottleneck) distance between the persistence modules is bounded from above by Shelukhin's Hofer distance. Moreover, the barcode is supported (i.e., has spectrum) on the lengths of translated points of the contactomorphism. We use this structure to prove various existence results for translated points and to construct spectral invariants for contactomorphisms which are monotone with respect to positive paths and continuous with respect to Shelukhin's Hofer distance. While this paper was nearing completion, the author was made aware of similar upcoming work by Djordjevi\'c, Uljarevi\'c, Zhang.</description>

      <title>On elementary cellular automata asymptotic (a)synchronism sensitivity and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the fundamental questions in computer science is that of the impact of synchronism/asynchronism on computations, which has been addressed in various fields of the discipline: in programming, in networking, in concurrence theory, in artificial learning, etc. In this paper, we tackle this question from a standpoint which mixes discrete dynamical system theory and computational complexity, by highlighting that the chosen way of making local computations can have a drastic influence on the performed global computation itself. To do so, we study how distinct update schedules may fundamentally change the asymptotic behaviors of finite dynamical systems, by analyzing in particular their limit cycle maximal period. For the message itself to be general and impacting enough, we choose to focus on a ``simple'' computational model which prevents underlying systems from having too many intrinsic degrees of freedom, namely elementary cellular automata. More precisely, for elementary cellular automata rules which are neither too simple nor too complex (the problem should be meaningless for both), we show that update schedule changes can lead to significant computational complexity jumps (from constant to superpolynomial ones) in terms of their temporal asymptotes.</description>
