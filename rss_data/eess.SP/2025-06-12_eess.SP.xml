      <title>Deep Semantic Segmentation for Multi-Source Localization Using Angle of Arrival Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a solution for multi source localization using only angle of arrival measurements. The receiver platform is in motion, while the sources are assumed to be stationary. Although numerous methods exist for single source localization, many relying on pseudo-linear formulations or non convex optimization techniques, there remains a significant gap in research addressing multi source localization in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we propose a deep learning-based framework that leverages semantic segmentation models for multi source localization. Specifically, we employ UNet and UNetPP as backbone models, processing input images that encode the platform's positions along with the corresponding direction finding lines at each position. By analyzing the intersections of these lines, the models effectively identify and localize multiple sources. Through simulations, we evaluate both single- and multi-source localization scenarios. Our results demonstrate that while the proposed approach performs comparably to traditional methods in single source localization, it achieves accurate source localization even in challenging conditions with high noise levels and an increased number of sources.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Data Requirements for EEG Independent Component Analysis Using AMICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR) and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition quality.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Travel Activity Monitoring: Generalized Distributed Acoustic Sensing Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining data on active travel activities such as walking, jogging, and cycling is important for refining sustainable transportation systems (STS). Effectively monitoring these activities not only requires sensing solutions to have a joint feature of being accurate, economical, and privacy-preserving, but also enough generalizability to adapt to different climate environments and deployment conditions. In order to provide a generalized sensing solution, a deep learning (DL)-enhanced distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system for monitoring active travel activities is proposed. By leveraging the ambient vibrations captured by DAS, this scheme infers motion patterns without relying on image-based or wearable devices, thereby addressing privacy concerns. We conduct real-world experiments in two geographically distinct locations and collect comprehensive datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. To address the generalization challenges posed by heterogeneous deployment environments, we propose two solutions according to network availability: 1) an Internet-of-Things (IoT) scheme based on federated learning (FL) is proposed, and it enables geographically different DAS nodes to be trained collaboratively to improve generalizability; 2) an off-line initialization approach enabled by meta-learning is proposed to develop high-generality initialization for DL models and to enable rapid model fine-tuning with limited data samples, facilitating generalization at newly established or isolated DAS nodes. Experimental results of the walking and cycling classification problem demonstrate the performance and generalizability of the proposed DL-enhanced DAS system, paving the way for practical, large-scale DAS monitoring of active travel.</description>

      <title>Ground Reaction Force Estimation via Time-aware Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy, and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force (GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process, effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from wearable sensor data.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous-IRS-Assisted MIMO Systems: Channel Estimation and Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has gained great attention for its ability to create favorable propagation environments. However, the power consumption of conventional IRSs cannot be ignored due to the large number of reflecting elements and control circuits. To balance performance and power consumption, we previously proposed a heterogeneous-IRS (HE-IRS), a green IRS structure integrating dynamically tunable elements (DTEs) and statically tunable elements (STEs). Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the unique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel estimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user multiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel estimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated is decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent channel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based channels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity information, a robust rank selection rule is developed. For beamforming, we propose an offline algorithm to optimize the STE phase shifts for wide beam coverage, and an online algorithm to optimize the BS precoder and the DTE phase shifts using the estimated HE-IRS channel. Simulation results show that the HE-IRS requires less pilot overhead than conventional IRSs with the same number of elements. With the proposed channel estimation and beamforming schemes, the green HE-IRS achieves competitive sum rate performance with significantly reduced power consumption.</description>

      <title>Relaxation-Free Min-k-Partition for PCI Assignment in 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical Cell Identity (PCI) is a critical parameter in 5G networks. Efficient and accurate PCI assignment is essential for mitigating mod-3 interference, mod-30 interference, collisions, and confusions among cells, which directly affect network reliability and user experience. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for PCI assignment by decomposing the problem into Min-3-Partition, Min-10-Partition, and a graph coloring problem, leveraging the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Furthermore, we develop a relaxation-free approach to the general Min-$k$-Partition problem by reformulating it as a quadratic program with a norm-equality constraint and solving it using a penalized mirror descent (PMD) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates superior computational efficiency and scalability, significantly reducing interference while eliminating collisions and confusions in large-scale 5G networks. Numerical evaluations on real-world datasets show that our approach reduces computational time by up to 20 times compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it highly practical for real-time PCI optimization in large-scale networks. These results highlight the potential of our method to improve network performance and reduce deployment costs in modern 5G systems.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network-aided Low Complexity Chase Decoder for URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand decoding algorithms that simultaneously offer high reliability and low complexity under stringent latency constraints. While iterative decoding schemes for LDPC and Polar codes offer a good compromise between performance and complexity, they fall short in approaching the theoretical performance limits in the typical URLLC short block length regime. Conversely, quasi-ML decoding schemes for algebraic codes, like Chase-II decoding, exhibit a smaller gap to optimum decoding but are computationally prohibitive for practical deployment in URLLC systems. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced Chase-II decoding algorithm that leverages a neural network (NN) to predict promising perturbation patterns, drastically reducing the number of required decoding trials. The proposed approach combines the reliability of quasi-ML decoding with the efficiency of NN inference, making it well-suited for time-sensitive and resource-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for Pinching Antennas Assisted RSMA System With Multiple Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, a pinching antennas (PAs) assisted rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) system with multiple waveguides is investigated to maximize sum rate. A two-step algorithm is proposed to determine PA activation scheme and optimize the waveguide beamforming. Specifically, a low complexity spatial correlation and distance based method is proposed for PA activation selection. After determining the PA activation status, a semi-definite programming (SDP) based successive convex approximation (SCA) is leveraged to obtain the optimal waveguide beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed multiple waveguides based PAs assisted RSMA method achieves better performance than various benchmarking schemes.</description>

      <title>Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized reflection coefficients of its unit elements.</description>

      <title>A Novel Signal Processing Strategy for Short-Range Laser Feedback Interferometry Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of wearable technologies, such as AR glasses, demands compact, energy-efficient sensors capable of high-precision measurements in dynamic environments. Traditional Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) Laser Feedback Interferometry (LFI) sensors, while promising, falter in applications that feature small distances, high velocities, shallow modulation, and low-power constraints. We propose a novel sensor-processing pipeline that reliably extracts distance and velocity measurements at distances as low as 1 cm. As a core contribution, we introduce a four-ramp modulation scheme that resolves persistent ambiguities in beat frequency signs and overcomes spectral blind regions caused by hardware limitations. Based on measurements of the implemented pipeline, a noise model is defined to evaluate its performance and sensitivity to several algorithmic and working point parameters. We show that the pipeline generally achieves robust and low-noise measurements using state-of-the-art hardware.</description>

      <title>Automotive Radar Online Channel Imbalance Estimation via NLMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automotive radars are one of the essential enablers of advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs). Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and reliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents and increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this context is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the reliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter variations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may affect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In this work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel imbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean squares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to estimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected targets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior knowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in combination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed method suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the normal operation of the radar. Furthermore, it features reduced dependency on specific targets of interest and faster update rates of the channel imbalance estimation compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods. This improvement is achieved by allowing for multiple targets in the angular spectrum, whereas most other methods are restricted to only single targets in the angular spectrum. The performance of the proposed method is validated using various simulation scenarios and is supported by measurement results.</description>

      <title>DeepPolar+: Breaking the BER-BLER Trade-off with Self-Attention and SMART (SNR-MAtched Redundancy Technique) decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DeepPolar codes have recently emerged as a promising approach for channel coding, demonstrating superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional polar codes. Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these codes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a fundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment in communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural polar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off by simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER characteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough through three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture that leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly optimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an adaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code (DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for robust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code configuration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and BLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and DeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved architecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further amplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error rate metrics over existing approaches. DeepPolar+ effectively bridges the gap between theoretical potential and practical implementation of neural polar codes, offering a viable path forward for next-generation error correction systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Learning Between ECG and PCG: Exploring Common and Exclusive Characteristics of Bimodal Electromechanical Cardiac Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Low-rank Factorizations of Conditional Correlation Matrices in Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems, we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance trade-off can be achieved with this approach.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models-Empowered Wireless Networks: Fundamentals, Architecture, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of wireless networks has resulted in numerous challenges stemming from their extensive demands for quality of service towards innovative quality of experience metrics (e.g., user-defined metrics in terms of sense of physical experience for haptics applications). In the meantime, large language models (LLMs) emerged as promising solutions for many difficult and complex applications/tasks. These lead to a notion of the integration of LLMs and wireless networks. However, this integration is challenging and needs careful attention in design. Therefore, in this article, we present a notion of rational wireless networks powered by \emph{telecom LLMs}, namely, \emph{LLM-native wireless systems}. We provide fundamentals, vision, and a case study of the distributed implementation of LLM-native wireless systems. In the case study, we propose a solution based on double deep Q-learning (DDQN) that outperforms existing DDQN solutions. Finally, we provide open challenges.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection for Sensing Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various approaches in the field of physical layer security involve anomaly detection, such as physical layer authentication, sensing attacks, and anti-tampering solutions. Depending on the context in which these approaches are applied, anomaly detection needs to be computationally lightweight, resilient to changes in temperature and environment, and robust against phase noise. We adapt moving average filters, autoregression filters and Kalman filters to provide predictions of feature vectors that fulfill the above criteria. Different hypothesis test designs are employed that allow omnidirectional and unidirectional outlier detection. In a case study, a sensing attack is investigated that employs the described algorithms with various channel features based on commodity WiFi devices. Thereby, various combinations of algorithms and channel features show effectiveness for motion detection by an attacker. Countermeasures only utilizing transmit power randomization are shown insufficient to mitigate such attacks if the attacker has access to channel state information (CSI) measurements, suggesting that mitigation solutions might require frequency-variant randomization.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration with Structural Nonparametric Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning. Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at https://github.com/tinymilky/SmoothProper.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Beyond 5G and 6G Connectivity: Leveraging NTN and RIS Synergies for Optimized Coverage and Capacity in High-Density Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for reliable, high-capacity communication during large-scale outdoor events poses significant challenges for traditional Terrestrial Networks (TNs), which often struggle to provide consistent coverage in high-density environments. This paper presents a novel 6G radio network planning framework that integrates Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to deliver ubiquitous coverage and enhanced network capacity. Our framework overcomes the limitations of conventional deployable base stations by leveraging NTN architectures, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and passive RIS platforms seamlessly integrated with Beyond 5G (B5G) TNs. By incorporating advanced B5G technologies such as Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and beamforming, and by optimizing spectrum utilization across the C, S, and Ka bands, we implement a rigorous interference management strategy based on a dynamic SINR model. Comprehensive calculations and simulations validate the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in connectivity, reliability, and cost-efficiency in crowded scenarios. This integration strategy represents a promising solution for meeting the evolving demands of future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>On Secret-Message Transmission by Echoing Encrypted Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scheme for secure communications, called ``Secret-message Transmission by Echoing Encrypted Probes (STEEP)'', is revisited. STEEP is a round-trip scheme with a probing phase from one user to another and an echoing phase in the reverse direction. STEEP is shown to be broadly applicable to yield a positive secrecy rate in bits per channel use even if the receive channels at eavesdropper (Eve) are stronger than those between legitimate users in both forward and reverse directions. This paper focuses on STEEP in the following settings: using Gaussian probing signal and Gaussian linear encryption over MIMO Gaussian channel (G-STEEP); using phase-shift-keying probing signal and a nonlinear encryption over SISO channel (P-STEEP); and a variation of G-STEEP for multiple access communication (M-STEEP). In each of the settings, Eve is assumed to have any given number of antennas, and STEEP is shown to yield a positive secrecy rate subject to a sufficiently large power in the echoing phase, as long as Eve's receive channel in the probing phase is not noiseless. It is also shown that G-STEEP, subject to asymmetric large powers in forward and reverse directions, has its secrecy rate approaching the secret-key capacity based on Gaussian probing signal over MIMO Gaussian channel. STEEP does not require secure feedback channel, collaborative third party, in-band full-duplex or reciprocal channels between users, but only needs a design for echoing encrypted probes, asymmetric power allocation and/or collaborative round-trip coding.</description>

      <title>WiFi-Diffusion: Achieving Fine-Grained WiFi Radio Map Estimation With Ultra-Low Sampling Rate by Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained radio map presents communication parameters of interest, e.g., received signal strength, at every point across a large geographical region. It can be leveraged to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization for a large area, particularly critical for the unlicensed WiFi spectrum. The problem of fine-grained radio map estimation is to utilize radio samples collected by sparsely distributed sensors to infer the map. This problem is challenging due to the ultra-low sampling rate, where the number of available samples is far less than the fine-grained resolution required for radio map estimation. We propose WiFi-Diffusion -- a novel generative framework for achieving fine-grained WiFi radio map estimation using diffusion models. WiFi-Diffusion employs the creative power of generative AI to address the ultra-low sampling rate challenge and consists of three blocks: 1) a boost block, using prior information such as the layout of obstacles to optimize the diffusion model; 2) a generation block, leveraging the diffusion model to generate a candidate set of radio maps; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model as a guide to find the best radio map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations demonstrate that 1) the fine-grained radio map generated by WiFi-Diffusion is ten times better than those produced by state-of-the-art (SOTA) when they use the same ultra-low sampling rate; and 2) WiFi-Diffusion achieves comparable fine-grained radio map quality with only one-fifth of the sampling rate required by SOTA.</description>

      <title>Network-level ISAC: An Analytical Study of Antenna Topologies Ranging from Massive to Cell-Free MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cooperative architecture is proposed for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks, incorporating coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission along with multi-static sensing. We investigate how the allocation of antennas-to-base stations (BSs) affects cooperative sensing and cooperative communication performance. More explicitly, we balance the benefits of geographically concentrated antennas in the massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) fashion, which enhance beamforming and coherent processing, against those of geographically distributed antennas towards cell-free transmission, which improve diversity and reduce service distances. Regarding sensing performance, we investigate three localization methods: angle-of-arrival (AOA)-based, time-of-flight (TOF)-based, and a hybrid approach combining both AOA and TOF measurements, for critically appraising their effects on ISAC network performance. Our analysis shows that in networks having N ISAC nodes following a Poisson point process, the localization accuracy of TOF-based methods follows a \ln^2 N scaling law (explicitly, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) reduces with \ln^2 N). The AOA-based methods follow a \ln N scaling law, while the hybrid methods scale as a\ln^2 N + b\ln N, where a and b represent parameters related to TOF and AOA measurements, respectively. The difference between these scaling laws arises from the distinct ways in which measurement results are converted into the target location. Specifically, when converting AOA measurements to the target location, the localization error introduced during this conversion is inversely proportional to the distance between the BS and the target, leading to a more significant reduction in accuracy as the number of transceivers increases.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scalogram for Computational Complexity Reduction in Acoustic Recognition Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.</description>
