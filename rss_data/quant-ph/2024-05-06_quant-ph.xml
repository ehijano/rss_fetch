      <title>Spontaneous Strong Symmetry Breaking in Open Systems: Purification Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the landscape of the decoherence effect in mixed-state ensembles from a purification perspective. We analyze the spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) in mixed states triggered by local quantum channels by mapping this decoherence process to unitary operations in the purified state within an extended Hilbert space. Our key finding is that mixed-state long-range order and SSSB can be mapped into symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order in the purified state. Notably, the measurement-induced long-range order in the purified SPT state mirrors the long-range order in the mixed state due to SSSB, characterized by the Renyi-2 correlator. We establish a correspondence between fidelity correlators in the mixed state, which serve as a measure of SSSB, and strange correlators in the purification, which signify the SPT order. This purification perspective is further extended to explore intrinsic mixed-state topological order and decoherent symmetry-protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Asynchronous Protocols for Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of entanglement in quantum networks is typically approached under idealized assumptions such as perfect synchronization and centralized control, while classical communication is often neglected. However, these assumptions prove impractical in large-scale networks. In this paper, we present a pragmatic perspective by exploring two minimal asynchronous protocols: a parallel scheme generating entanglement independently at the link level, and a sequential scheme extending entanglement iteratively from one party to the other. Our analysis incorporates non-uniform repeater spacings and classical communications and accounts for quantum memory decoherence. We evaluate network performance using metrics such as entanglement bit rate, end-to-end fidelity, and secret key rate for entanglement-based quantum key distribution. Our findings suggest the sequential scheme's superiority due to comparable performance with the parallel scheme, coupled with simpler implementation. Additionally, we propose a cutoff strategy to improve performance by discarding attempts with prolonged memory idle time, effectively eliminating low-quality entanglement links. Finally, we apply our methods to the real-world topology of SURFnet and report the performance as a function of memory coherence time.</description>

      <title>Transforming graph states via Bell state measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are key resources for measurement-based quantum computing which is particularly promising for photonic systems. Fusions are probabilistic Bell state measurements, measuring pairs of parity operators of two qubits. Fusions can be used to connect/entangle different graph states making them a powerful resource for measurement-based and the related fusion-based quantum computing. There are several different graph structures and types of Bell state measurements, yet the associated graph transformations have only been analyzed for a few specific cases. Here, we provide a full set of such graph transformation rules and we give an intuitive visualization based on Venn diagrams of local neighborhoods of graph nodes. We derive these graph transformations for all fusion types showing that there are five different types of fusion success cases. Finally, we give application examples of the derived graph transformation rules and show that they can be used for constructing graph codes or simulating fusion networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equations are obtained for the quantum distribution functions over discrete states in systems of non-interacting fermions and bosons with an arbitrary, including small, number of particles. The case of systems with two levels is considered in detail. The temperature dependences of entropy, heat capacities and pressure in two-level Fermi and Bose systems are calculated for various multiplicities of degeneracy of levels.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the time-dependent characteristics of AB-type effects holds significant importance in contemporary physics and its practical applications. Here, we delve into the investigation of time-dependent topological effects emerging in AB-type experimental setups. We first analyze the topological effects on magnetic dipoles moving in closed trajectories around the time-varying magnetic field source solenoid, then on electrical dipoles around a time-varying electric field source in 2+1 dimensions without any approximation. Last, we discuss the characteristics of the topological effects by considering the identity and dualities between phases from an integrated perspective.</description>

      <title>N-Way Frequency Beamsplitter for Quantum Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical networks are the leading platform for the transfer of information due to their low loss and ability to scale to many information channels using optical frequency modes. To fully leverage the quantum properties of light in this platform, it is desired to manipulate higher-dimensional superpositions by orchestrating linear, beamsplitter-type interactions between several channels simultaneously. We propose a method of achieving simultaneous, all-to-all coupling between N optical frequency modes via N-way Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing. By exploiting the frequency degree of freedom, additional modes can be multiplexed in an interaction medium of fixed volume and loss, avoiding the introduction of excess noise. We generalize the theory of the frequency-encoded two-mode interaction to N modes under this four-wave mixing approach and experimentally verify the quantum nature of this scheme by demonstrating three-way multiphoton interference. The two input photons are shared among three frequency modes and display interference differing from that of two classical (coherent-state) inputs. These results show the potential of our approach for the scalability of photonic quantum information processing to general N-mode systems in the frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Artificial-Intelligence-Driven Shot Reduction in Quantum Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) provides a powerful solution for approximating molecular ground state energies by combining quantum circuits and classical computers. However, estimating probabilistic outcomes on quantum hardware requires repeated measurements (shots), incurring significant costs as accuracy increases. Optimizing shot allocation is thus critical for improving the efficiency of VQE. Current strategies rely heavily on hand-crafted heuristics requiring extensive expert knowledge. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach that automatically learns shot assignment policies to minimize total measurement shots while achieving convergence to the minimum of the energy expectation in VQE. The RL agent assigns measurement shots across VQE optimization iterations based on the progress of the optimization. This approach reduces VQE's dependence on static heuristics and human expertise. When the RL-enabled VQE is applied to a small molecule, a shot reduction policy is learned. The policy demonstrates transferability across systems and compatibility with other wavefunction ansatzes. In addition to these specific findings, this work highlights the potential of RL for automatically discovering efficient and scalable quantum optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Toffoli-Depth Quantum Adder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient quantum arithmetic circuits are commonly found in numerous quantum algorithms of practical significance. Till date, the logarithmic-depth quantum adders includes a constant coefficient k &gt;= 2 while achieving the Toffoli-Depth of klog n + O(1). In this work, 160 alternative compositions of the carry-propagation structure are comprehensively explored to determine the optimal depth structure for a quantum adder. By extensively studying these structures, it is shown that an exact Toffoli-Depth of log n + O(1) is achievable. This presents a reduction of Toffoli-Depth by almost 50% compared to the best known quantum adder circuits presented till date. We demonstrate a further possible design by incorporating a different expansion of propagate and generate forms, as well as an extension of the modular framework. Our paper elaborates on these designs, supported by detailed theoretical analyses and simulation-based studies, firmly substantiating our claims of optimality. The results also mirror similar improvements, recently reported in classical adder circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>Design of an entanglement purification protocol selection module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement purification protocols, designed to improve the fidelity of Bell states over quantum networks for inter-node communications, have attracted significant attention over the last few decades. These protocols have great potential to resolve a core challenge in quantum networking of generating high-fidelity Bell states. However, previous studies focused on the theoretical discussion with limited consideration of realistic errors. Studies of dynamically selecting the right purification protocol under various realistic errors that populate in practice have yet to be performed. In this work, we study the performance of various purification protocols under realistic errors by conducting density matrix simulations over a large suite of error models. Based on our findings of how specific error channels affect the performance of purification protocols, we propose a module that can be embedded in the quantum network. This module determines and selects the appropriate purification protocol, considering not only expected specifications from the network layer but also the capabilities of the physical layer. Finally, the performance of our proposed module is verified using two benchmark categories. Compared with the default approach and exhaustive search approach, we show a success rate approaching 90% in identifying the optimal purification protocol for our target applications.</description>

      <title>Dirac Brackets $\leftrightarrow$ Open Quantum Systems: A Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time evolution of an open quantum system is governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindlad equation for the reduced density operator of the system. This operator is obtained from the full density operator of the composite system involving the system itself, the bath, and the interactions between them, by performing a partial trace over the bath degrees of freedom. The entanglement between the system and the bath leads to a generalized Liouville evolution that involves, amongst other things, dissipation and decoherence of the system.
  In a similar fashion, the time evolution of a physical observable in a classically constrained dynamical system is governed by a generalization of the Liouville equation, in which the usual Poisson bracket is replaced by the so-called Dirac bracket. The generalization takes into account the reduction in the phase space of the system because of constraints, which arise either because they are introduced by hand, or because of some underlying gauge invariance.
  We derive an intriguing, but precise classical-quantum correspondence between the aforementioned situations which connects the Lindblad operators to the constraints. The correspondence is illustrated in a system of coupled simple harmonic oscillators studied earlier in the context of the area law of black holes by Bombelli, Koul, Lee, and Sorkin, and independently by Srednicki.</description>

      <title>cuTN-QSVM: cuTensorNet-accelerated Quantum Support Vector Machine with cuQuantum SDK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) with an emphasis on the computational advancements enabled by NVIDIA's cuQuantum SDK, especially leveraging the cuTensorNet library. We present a simulation workflow that substantially diminishes computational overhead, as evidenced by our experiments, from exponential to quadratic cost. While state vector simulations become infeasible for qubit counts over 50, our evaluation demonstrates that cuTensorNet speeds up simulations to be completed within seconds on the NVIDIA A100 GPU, even for qubit counts approaching 784. By employing multi-GPU processing with Message Passing Interface (MPI), we document a marked decrease in computation times, effectively demonstrating the strong linear speedup of our approach for increasing data sizes. This enables QSVMs to operate efficiently on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, thereby opening a new window for researchers to explore complex quantum algorithms that have not yet been investigated. In accuracy assessments, our QSVM achieves up to 95\% on challenging classifications within the MNIST dataset for training sets larger than 100 instances, surpassing the capabilities of classical SVMs. These advancements position cuTensorNet within the cuQuantum SDK as a pivotal tool for scaling quantum machine learning simulations and potentially signpost the seamless integration of such computational strategies as pivotal within the Quantum-HPC ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Navigating the phase diagram of quantum many-body systems in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the unique capabilities of the Wigner function, particularly in its positive and negative parts, for exploring the phase diagram of the spin$-(\frac{1}{2\!}-\!\frac{1}{2})$ and spin$-(\frac{1}{2}\!-\!1)$ Ising-Heisenberg chains. We highlight the advantages and limitations of the phase space approach in comparison with the entanglement concurrence in detecting phase boundaries. We establish that the equal angle slice approximation in the phase space is an effective method for capturing the essential features of the phase diagram, but falls short in accurately assessing the negativity of the Wigner function for the homogeneous spin$-(\frac{1}{2}\!-\!\frac{1}{2})$ Ising-Heisenberg chain. In contrast, we find for the inhomogeneous spin$-(\frac{1}{2}\!-\!1)$ chain that an integral over the entire phase space is necessary to accurately capture the phase diagram of the system. This distinction underscores the sensitivity of phase space methods to the homogeneity of the quantum system under consideration.</description>

      <title>Fermi's golden rule rate expression for transitions due to nonadiabatic derivative couplings in the adiabatic basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a compact but general molecular Hamiltonian expressed in the bases of adiabatic electronic states and position states of nuclei, we make careful consideration of nonadiabatic derivative coupling (NDC) terms between adiabatic states. It is clarified that the conventional use of NDC terms evaluated for an adiabatic electronic state in the textbook expression for the Fermi's golden rule (FGR) rate implicitly invokes an additional approximation that ignores non-orthogonality of adiabatic states at different geometries. Thus, we derive a well-defined FGR rate expression based on a quasi-adiabatic approximation that explicitly uses the adiabatic states and NDC terms evaluated at the minimum potential energy state of the initial adiabatic states. We then clarify conditions and approximations leading to the modeling of all the nuclear degrees of freedom as a set of harmonic oscillators, and then derive a closed form FGR rate expression while accounting for the non-Condon effects due to momenta in NDC terms explicitly. The resulting rate expression includes terms due to quadratic contribution of NDC terms and also their couplings to Franck-Condon modes. Model calculations for the case where nuclear vibrations consist of both a sharp high frequency mode and a broad Ohmic bath spectral density illustrate new features and implications of the rate expression.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Fidelity in Quantum State Transfer Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer protocols are a major toolkit in many quantum information processing tasks, from quantum key distribution to quantum computation. To assess performance of a such a protocol, one often relies on the average fidelity between the input and the output states. Going beyond this scheme, we analyze the entire probability distribution of fidelity, providing a general framework to derive it for the transfer of single- and two-qubit states. Starting from the delta-like shape of the fidelity distribution, characteristic to perfect transfer, we analyze its broadening and deformation due to realistic features of the process, including non-perfect read-out timing. Different models of quantum transfer, sharing the same value of the average fidelity, display different distributions of fidelity, providing thus additional information on the protocol, including the minimum fidelity.</description>

      <title>On the role of chirping in pulsed single photon spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the precision of estimating the interaction strength between a two-level system (TLS) and a single-photon pulse when the latter is subject to chirping. We consider linear, quadratic, and sinusoidal temporal phases applied to Gaussian and exponential temporal profiles. At the asymptotic time, when the TLS has fully decayed to its ground state, the fundamental precision depends solely on the magnitude of its spectral amplitude. For quadratically phase-modulated Gaussian pulses, this is entirely determined by the spectral bandwidth. We provide expressions for evaluating the fundamental precision for general temporal profiles and phase modulations. Finally, we show that experimentally feasible mode-resolved measurements are optimal, or close to it, for chirped, pulsed single photon spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Enhanced Single-Photon Fock State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though heralded single-photon sources have been generated routinely through the spontaneous parametric down conversion, vacuum and multiple photon states are unavoidably involved. With machine-learning, we report the experimental implementation of single-photon quantum state tomography by directly estimating target parameters. Compared to the Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) measurements only with clicked events recorded, our neural network enhanced quantum state tomography characterizes the photon number distribution for all possible photon number states from the balanced homodyne detectors. By using the histogram-based architecture, a direct parameter estimation on the negativity in Wigner's quasi-probability phase space is demonstrated. Such a fast, robust, and precise quantum state tomography provides us a crucial diagnostic toolbox for the applications with single-photon Fock states and other non-Gaussisan quantum states.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical effects of photon-phonon antibunching in a multifield driven optomechanical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonclassical signature of a photon-phonon pair can be tested effectively by violating Cauchy-Schwarz and Bell's inequality, which can arise due to antibunching phenomena in coupled bosonic systems. In this paper, we analyze the measurement criteria imposed on the second-order coherence functions and investigate the quantum correlations leading to the suppression of multi-photon-phonon excitation in a single optomechanical cavity upon driving it with two pumping fields. It is also shown that the Cauchy-Schwarz violation can serve as an ideal precursor to demonstrate stronger tests of locality related to Bell's inequality. We consider weak driving and optomechanical coupling coefficient parameters in the system that enables the unconventional nature of photon (phonon) blockades while operating in the resonance of cavity detuning and mechanical frequency. These findings are valuable for generating sub-Poissonian signals in optimal conditions and have potential applications in hybrid systems for on-demand single photon (phonon) detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a model for the behavior of Dirac particles under the tensor effect in the spherical core/shell regime. We examine the change of energy levels corresponding to the particles localized in a space of approximately 1.0 fm in the core region of the quantum sphere, with the well width. It also occurs from the analytical solutions that the two different levels accompany particle states of the same mass. Additionally, the solutions exhibiting anomalous behavior, giving rise to antiparticle-type states, occur at heavier mass.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Kinetic Inductance in Tantalum-Based Superconducting Coplanar Waveguide Resonators for Alleviating Frequency Fluctuation Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in the fabrication of superconducting quantum devices have highlighted tantalum as a promising material, owing to its low surface oxidation microwave loss at low temperatures. However, tantalum films exhibit significantly larger kinetic inductances compared to materials such as aluminum or niobium. Given the inevitable variations in film thickness, this increased kinetic inductance leads to considerable, uncontrolled frequency variances and shifts in components like superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators. Achieving high precision in resonator frequencies is crucial, particularly when multiple resonators share a common Purcell filter with limited bandwidth in superconducting quantum information processors. Here, we tackle this challenge from both fabrication and design perspectives, achieving a reduction in resonator frequency fluctuation by a factor of more than 100. Concurrently, the internal quality factor of the SCPW resonator remains at high level. Our findings open up new avenues for the enhanced utilization of tantalum in large-scale superconducting chips.</description>

      <title>Trade-off relations between Bell nonlocality and local Kochen-Specker contextuality in generalized Bell scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relations between Bell nonlocality and Kochen-Specker contextuality have been subject of research from many different perspectives in the last decades. Recently, some interesting results on these relations have been explored in the so-called generalized Bell scenarios, that is, scenarios where Bell spatial separation (or agency independence) coexist with (at least one of the) parties' ability to perform compatible measurements at each round of the experiment. When this party has an $n$-cycle compatiblity setup, it was first claimed that Bell nonlocality could not be concomitantly observed with contextuality at this party's local experiment. However, by a more natural reading of the definition of locality, it turns out that both Bell nonlocality and local contextuality can, in fact, be jointly present. In spite of it, in this work we prove that there cannot be arbitrary amounts of both of these two resources together. That is, we show the existence of a trade-off relation between Bell nonlocality and local contextuality in such scenarios. We explore this trade-off both in terms of inequalities and quantifiers, and we discuss how it can be understood in terms of a `global' notion of contextuality. Furthermore, we show that such notion does not only encompass local contextuality and Bell nonlocality, but also other forms of nonclassical correlations.</description>

      <title>Efficient discrimination between real and complex quantum theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the test to show the impossibility of a quantum theory based on real numbers by a larger ratio of complex-to-real bound on a Bell-type parameter. In contrast to previous theoretical and experimental proposals the test requires three setting for the parties $A$ and $C$, but also six settings for the middle party $B$, assuming separability of the sources. The bound for this symmetric configuration imposed on a real theory is $14.88$ whilst the complex maximum is $18$. This large theoretical difference enables us to demonstrate the concomitant experimental violation on IBM quantum computer via a designed quantum network, obtaining as a result $15.44$ at more than $80$ standard deviations above the real bound.</description>

      <title>Understanding the effects of data encoding on quantum-classical convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning was recently applied to various applications and leads to results that are comparable or, in certain instances, superior to classical methods, in particular when few training data is available. These results warrant a more in-depth examination of when and why improvements can be observed. A key component of quantum-enhanced methods is the data encoding strategy used to embed the classical data into quantum states. However, a clear consensus on the selection of a fitting encoding strategy given a specific use-case has not yet been reached. This work investigates how the data encoding impacts the performance of a quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCCNN) on two medical imaging datasets. In the pursuit of understanding why one encoding method outperforms another, two directions are explored. Potential correlations between the performance of the quantum-classical architecture and various quantum metrics are first examined. Next, the Fourier series decomposition of the quantum circuits is analyzed, as variational quantum circuits generate Fourier-type sums. We find that while quantum metrics offer limited insights into this problem, the Fourier coefficients analysis appears to provide better clues to understand the effects of data encoding on QCCNNs.</description>

      <title>Logical Error Rates for a [[4,2,2]]-Encoded Variational Quantum Eigensolver Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application benchmarks that run on noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing devices require techniques for mitigating errors to improve accuracy and precision. Quantum error detection codes offer a framework by which to encode quantum computations and identify when errors occur. However, the subsequent logical error rate depends on the encoded application circuit as well as the underlying noise. Here, we quantify how the [[4,2,2]] quantum error detection code improves the logical error rate, accuracy, and precision of an encoded variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) application. We benchmark the performance of the encoded VQE for estimating the energy of the hydrogen molecule with a chemical accuracy of 1.6 mHa while managing the trade-off between probability of success of various post-selection methods. Using numerical simulation of the noisy mixed state preparation, we find that the most aggressive post-selection strategies improve the accuracy and precision of the encoded estimates even at the cost of increasing loss of samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative probabilities arise primarily in quantum theory and computing. Bartlett provides a definition based on characteristic functions and extraordinary random variables. As Bartlett observes, negative probabilities must always be combined with positive probabilities to yield a valid probability distribution before any physical interpretation is admissible. Negative probabilities arise as mixing distributions of unobserved latent variables in Bayesian modeling. Our goal is to provide a link with dual densities and the class of scale mixtures of normal distributions. We provide an analysis of the classic half coin distribution and Feynman's negative probability examples. A number of examples of dual densities with negative mixing measures including the linnik distribution, Wigner distribution and the stable distribution are provided. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong coupling limit to quantum mean force Gibbs state for anharmonic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium state of a quantum system can deviate from the Gibbs state if the system-environment coupling is not weak. An analytical expression for this mean force Gibbs state (MFGS) is known in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime for the Caldeira-Leggett (CL) model that assumes a harmonic environment. Here, we derive analytical expressions for the MFGS in the USC regime for more general system-environment models. For all the generalized models considered here, we find the USC state to be diagonal in the basis set by the system-environment interaction, just like in the CL case. While for the generic model considered, the corresponding USC-MFGS state is found to alter from the CL-result, we do identify a class of models more general than the CL-model for which the CL-USC result remains unchanged. We also provide numerical verification for our results. These results provide key tools for the study of strong coupling thermodynamics under more realistic system-environment models, going beyond the CL-model.</description>

      <title>A Greedy Quantum Route-Generation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing and scheduling problems with time windows have long been important optimization problems for logistics and planning. Many classical heuristics and exact methods exist for such problems. However, there are no satisfactory methods for generating routes using quantum computing (QC), for mainly two reasons: inequality constraints, and the trade-off of feasibility and solution quality. Inequality constraints are typically handled using slack variables; and feasible solutions are found by filtering samples. These challenges are amplified in the presence of noise inherent in QC. Here, we propose a greedy algorithm that generates routes by using information from all samples obtained from the quantum computer. By noticing the relationship between qubits in our formulation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we designed an algorithm that adaptively constructs a feasible solution.
  We prove its convergence to a feasible solution, and illustrate its efficacy by solving the Fleet Sizing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (FSVRPTW). Our computational results show that this method obtains a lower objective value than the current state-of-the-art annealing approaches, both classical and hybrid, for the same amount of time using D-Wave Hybrid Solvers. We also show its robustness to noise on D-Wave Advantage 4.1 through computational results as compared to the filtering approach on DWaveSampler, even when the filtering approach is given a longer annealing time, and a larger sample size.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of optical cavity QED systems, as described by the driven, open Jaynes-Cummings model and some of its variants, as potential sources of steady-state Wigner-negative light. We consider temporal modes in the continuous output field from the cavity and demonstrate pronounced negativity in their Wigner distributions for experimentally-relevant parameter regimes. We consider models of both single and collective atomic spin systems, and find a rich structure of Wigner-distribution negativity as the spin size is varied. We also demonstrate an effective realization of all of the models considered using just a single 87Rb atom and based upon combinations of laser- and laser-plus-cavity-driven Raman transitions between magnetic sublevels in a single ground hyperfine state.</description>

Abstract: Quantum batteries have significant potential applications for future industry and daily life. The capacity is an important indicator for a battery. Methods to improve the capacity of quantum batteries are important. We consider quantum batteries given by bipartite quantum systems and study the enhancement of the battery capacity under local projective measurements on a subsystem of the quantum state. By using two-qubit Bell-diagonal states and X-type states as examples, we show that quantum battery capacity with respect to the whole system or a subsystem can be improved by local projective measurements. Our theoretical analysis will provide ideas for the experimental development of quantum batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum paradoxes are essential means to reveal the incompatibility between quantum and classical theories, among which the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering paradox offers a sharper criterion for the contradiction between local-hidden-state model and quantum mechanics than the usual inequality-based method. In this work, we present a generalized EPR steering paradox, which predicts a contradictory equality $2_{Q}=\left( 1+\delta\right)_{C}$ ($0\leq\delta&lt;1$) given by the quantum ($Q$) and classical ($C$) theories. For any $N$-qubit state in which the conditional state of the steered party is pure, we test the paradox through a two-setting steering protocol, and find that the state is steerable if some specific measurement requirements are satisfied. Moreover, our construction also enlightens the building of EPR steering inequality, which may contribute to some schemes for typical quantum teleportation and quantum key distributions.</description>

      <title>Performance Upper Bound of the Grover-Mixer Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) represents a branch of quantum algorithms designed for solving combinatorial optimization problems. A specific variant, the Grover-Mixer Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (GM-QAOA), ensures uniform amplitude across states that share equivalent objective values. This property makes the algorithm independent of the problem structure, focusing instead on the distribution of objective values within the problem. In this work, we prove the probability upper bound for measuring a computational basis state from a GM-QAOA circuit with a given depth, which is a critical factor in QAOA cost. From this, we derive the upper bounds for the probability of sampling an optimal solution and for the approximation ratio of maximum optimization problems, based on the objective value distribution. Using numerical analysis, we link the distribution to the problem size and build the regression models that relate the problem size, QAOA depth, and performance upper bound. Our results suggest that the GM-QAOA provides a quadratic enhancement in sampling probability and requires circuit depth that scales exponentially with problem size to maintain consistent performance.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorovian Censorship, Predictive Incompleteness, and the locality loophole in Bell experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the foundations of quantum mechanics, the Kolmogorovian Censorship (KC) stipulates that quantum probabilities can be identified with classical, Kolmogorovian probabilities when considering a specified measurement context. Then in any given measurement context it is possible to build a Kolmogorovian probability distribution, or equivalently a hidden variable theory; however this distribution must be matched to the chosen context. In a loophole-free Bell test, the remote random choices of measurements (polarizers orientations) have the purpose to prevent that this matching can be obtained from any relativistically causal transmission between the source and the detectors. Then the matching (required to violate Bell's inequalities) may be obtained either by an instantaneous influence at a distance between the source and the detectors (explicit nonlocality), or by assuming that it is pre-established before the actual experiment takes place (super-determinism). If both influence at a distance and super-determinism are not accepted on physical grounds, a third way is still available, called "predictive incompleteness": it tells that the usual quantum state $\psi$ is incomplete, as long as the measurement context has not been specified. In agreement with the general quantum framework called CSM (Contexts, Systems and Modalities) we argue that predictive incompleteness is the correct quantum way to understand the violation of Bell's inequalities.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear criterion for characterizing high-dimensional multipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding entanglement of potentially high-dimensional multipartite quantum systems is crucial across different disciplines in quantum sciences. We take inspiration from covariance matrix based techniques to derive a nonlinear criterion that can be used to lower bound the dimensionality vector of mixed quantum states, revealing both the level of multipartiteness and the dimensionality of the entanglement in the quantum states. The technique is based on a system of inequalities that has to be satisfied by all quantum states with a given entanglement dimensionality vector, which can be checked via linear programming. We test our condition on paradigmatic classes of high-dimensional multipartite entangled states like imperfect Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and find that, in comparison with other available criteria our method provides a significant advantage, which is enhanced especially in the case that the dimensions of the individual particles are different from each other.</description>

Abstract: A quantum advantage can be achieved in the unitary charging of quantum batteries if their cells are interacting. Here, we try to clarify with some analytical calculations whether and how this quantum advantage is achieved for sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev interactions. By performing a simple modelization, we find that for $q$-point rescaled sparse SYK interactions the quantum advantage goes as $\Gamma\sim N^{\frac{\alpha}{q}-\frac{1}{2}}$, where $\alpha$ is related to the connectivity and $N$ is the number of cells.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Inverse Participation Ratio Estimation in multi-qubit and multi-qudit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse Participation Ratios (IPRs) and the related Participation Entropies quantify the spread of a quantum state over a selected basis of the Hilbert space, offering insights into the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of the system. In this work, we propose three quantum algorithms to estimate IPRs on multi-qubit and multi-qudit quantum devices. The first algorithm allows for the estimation of IPRs in the computational basis by single-qubit measurements, while the second one enables measurement of IPR in the eigenbasis of a selected Hamiltonian, without the knowledge about the eigenstates of the system. Next, we provide an algorithm for IPR in the computational basis for a multi-qudit system. We discuss resources required by the algorithms and benchmark them by investigating the one-axis twisting protocol, the thermalization in a deformed PXP model, and the ground state of a spin-$1$ AKLT chain in a transverse field.</description>

      <title>Delayed Electron-Ion Entanglement Revealed with Zero Area Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when the remaining ion is dressed by a field. As was recently shown, the doublet can be interpreted as a signature of quantum entanglement between photoelectrons and strongly coupled ions. However, the dressed state nature of the ion prevents detection of the entanglement by straightforward coincidence detection. Here, we find that odd (zero-area) envelopes can substantially delay the generation of entanglement, but also modify the dynamics such that the doublet transforms into unique channel-resolved photoelectron distributions. Because these distributions can be used to correlate with the internal state of the ion, our proposed scheme opens up for detection of quantum entanglement, between photoelectrons and stongly-coupled ions, without a need for quantum phase measurements.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional quantum key distribution using orbital angular momentum of single photons from a colloidal quantum dot at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HDQKD) is a promising avenue to address the inherent limitations of basic QKD protocols. However, experimental realizations of HDQKD to date have relied on indeterministic photon sources that limit the achievable key rate. In this paper, we demonstrate a full emulation of a HDQKD system using a single colloidal giant quantum dot (gQD) as a deterministic, compact and room-temperature single-photon source (SPS). We demonstrate a practical protocol by encoding information in a high-dimensional space ($d = 3$) of the orbital angular momentum of the photons. Our experimental configuration incorporates two spatial light modulators for encoding and decoding the spatial information carried by individual photons. Our experimental demonstration establishes the feasibility of utilizing high radiative quantum yield gQDs as practical SPSs for HDQKD. We also demonstrate experimentally secure qudit transmission exceeding one secure bit per photon, thus already beating the traditional d=2 QKD capacity.</description>

      <title>Prediction of chaotic dynamics and extreme events: A recurrence-free quantum reservoir computing approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In chaotic dynamical systems, extreme events manifest in time series as unpredictable large-amplitude peaks. Although deterministic, extreme events appear seemingly randomly, which makes their forecasting difficult. By learning the dynamics from observables (data), reservoir computers can time-accurately predict extreme events and chaotic dynamics, but they may require many degrees of freedom (large reservoirs). In this paper, by exploiting quantum-computer ans\"atze and entanglement, we design reservoir computers with compact reservoirs and accurate prediction capabilities. First, we propose the recurrence-free quantum reservoir computer (RF-QRC) architecture. By developing ad-hoc quantum feature maps and removing recurrent connections, the RF-QRC has quantum circuits with small depths. This allows the RF-QRC to scale well with higher-dimensional chaotic systems, which makes it suitable for hardware implementation. Second, we forecast the temporal chaotic dynamics and their long-term statistics of low- and higher-dimensional dynamical systems. We find that RF-QRC requires smaller reservoirs than classical reservoir computers. Third, we apply the RF-QRC to the time prediction of extreme events in a model of a turbulent shear flow with turbulent bursts. We find that the RF-QRC has a longer predictability than the classical reservoir computer. The results and analyses indicate that quantum-computer ans\"atze offer nonlinear expressivity and computational scalability, which are useful for forecasting chaotic dynamics and extreme events. This work opens new opportunities for using quantum machine learning on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>The Decoherent Arrow of Time and the Entanglement Past Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If an asymmetry in time does not arise from the fundamental dynamical laws of physics, it may be found in special boundary conditions. The argument normally goes that since thermodynamic entropy in the past is lower than in the future according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, then tracing this back to the time around the Big Bang means the universe must have started off in a state of very low thermodynamic entropy: the Thermodynamic Past Hypothesis. In this paper, we consider another boundary condition that plays a similar role, but for the decoherent arrow of time, i.e. the quantum state of the universe is more mixed in the future than in the past. According to what we call the Entanglement Past Hypothesis, the initial quantum state of the universe had very low entanglement entropy. We clarify the content of the Entanglement Past Hypothesis, compare it with the Thermodynamic Past Hypothesis, and identify some challenges and open questions for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum Otto engine with a quantum Ising spin glass as the working medium to explore the scaling behavior of work output and thermodynamic performance concerning system size, particularly near the critical point. Specifically, we explore the two operating modes of the Otto engine, namely the heat engine and refrigerator modes. We observe a double-peaked structure in the heat engine regime, leading to superlinear scaling in both work output and thermodynamic performance near the critical point. Additionally, in the refrigerator regime, superlinear scaling in refrigerator efficiency can be achieved at high and low temperatures, significantly outperforming models with uniform Ising interactions. These findings suggest that disorder and frustration in quantum Ising spin-glass systems could significantly impact thermodynamic performance in quantum heat engines and refrigerators, potentially opening up new avenues for improvement.</description>

      <title>Homological Quantum Error Correction with Torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homological quantum error correction uses tools of algebraic topology and homological algebra to derive Calderbank-Shor-Steane quantum error correcting codes from cellulations of topological spaces. This work is an exploration of the relevant topics, a journey from classical error correction, through homology theory, to CSS codes acting on qudit systems. Qudit codes have torsion in their logical spaces. This is interesting to study because it gives us extra logical qudits, of possibly different dimension.
  Apart from examples and comments on the topic, we prove an original result, the Structure Theorem for the Qudit Logical Space, an application of the Universal Coefficient Theorem from homological algebra, which gives us information about the logical space when torsion is involved, and that improves on a previous result in the literature. Furthermore, this work introduces our own abstracted and restricted version of the general notion of a cell complex, suited exactly to our needs.</description>

      <title>Modulation transfer protocol for Rydberg RF receivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a modulation transfer protocol to increase the detection sensitivity of a Rydberg RF receiver to fields out of resonance from the transition between Rydberg levels. This protocol is based on a phase modulation of the control field used to create the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) signal. The nonlinear wave-mixing of the multi-component coupling laser and the probe laser transfers the modulation to the probe laser, which is used for RF-field detection. The measurements compare very well to semi-classical simulations of atom-light interaction and show an improvement in the RF bandwidth of the sensor and an improved sensitivity of the response to weak fields.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Mixed Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry in mixed quantum states can manifest in two distinct forms: strong symmetry, where each individual pure state in the quantum ensemble is symmetric with the same charge, and weak symmetry, which applies only to the entire ensemble. This paper explores a novel type of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) where a strong symmetry is broken to a weak one. While the SSB of a weak symmetry is measured by the long-ranged two-point correlation function $\mathrm{Tr}(O_xO^{\dagger}_y\rho)$, the strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) is measured by the fidelity $F(\rho, O_xO^{\dagger}_y\rho O_yO^{\dagger}_x)$, dubbed the fidelity correlator. We prove that SW-SSB is a universal property of mixed-state quantum phases, in the sense that the phenomenon of SW-SSB is robust against symmetric low-depth local quantum channels. We argue that a thermal state at a nonzero temperature in the canonical ensemble (with fixed symmetry charge) should have spontaneously broken strong symmetry. Additionally, we study non-thermal scenarios where decoherence induces SW-SSB, leading to phase transitions described by classical statistical models with bond randomness. In particular, the SW-SSB transition of a decohered Ising model can be viewed as the "ungauged" version of the celebrated toric code decodability transition. We confirm that, in the decohered Ising model, the SW-SSB transition defined by the fidelity correlator is the only physical transition in terms of channel recoverability. We also comment on other (inequivalent) definitions of SW-SSB, through correlation functions with higher R\'enyi indices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss an approach to calculate knot polynomials on a photonic processor. Calculations of knot polynomials is a computationally difficult problem and therefore it is interesting to use new advanced calculation methods to find them. Here we present a proof of concept by calculating the simplest knot polynomial of the trefoil knot in fundamental representation. This approach, however, can easily be generalized to more complex knots and representations. Same operators can also be realized on a quantum computer with the same effect.</description>

      <title>Exponential optimization of quantum state preparation via adiabatic thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of a given quantum state on a quantum computing register is a typically demanding operation, requiring a number of elementary gates that scales exponentially with the size of the problem. Using the adiabatic theorem for state preparation, whose error decreases exponentially as a function of the thermalization time, we derive an explicit analytic expression for the dependence of the characteristic time on the Hamiltonian used in the adiabatic evolution. Exploiting this knowledge, we then design a preconditioning term that modifies the adiabatic preparation, thus reducing its characteristic time and hence giving an exponential advantage in state preparation. We prove the efficiency of our method with extensive numerical experiments on prototypical spin-models, which gives a promising strategy to perform quantum simulations of manybody models via Trotter evolution on near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational complexity theory, it remains to be understood whether $\textbf{BQP}$ is the same as $\textbf{BPP}$. Prima facie, one would expect that this mathematical question is quite unrelated to the foundational question of whether the quantum state is an element of reality or of the observer's knowledge. By contrast, here we argue that the complexity of computation in a physical theory may constrain its physical interpretation. Specifically in the quantum case, we argue that a subjective interpretation of the quantum mechanics favors the proposition $\textbf{BQP} = \textbf{BPP}$. Therefore, if $\textbf{BPP} \subset \textbf{BQP}$, then a realist interpretation of quantum mechanics would be favored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an innovative design for topological quantum batteries that involves coupling two atoms to a one-dimensional lattice with topological features. Employing the resolvent method, we analytically explore the thermodynamic performances of quantum batteries (QBs). First, we demonstrate that only coherent bound states significantly contribute to the stored energy of QBs. We observe near-perfect energy transfer from the quantum charger to the quantum battery (QB) in the topologically nontrivial phase. Conversely, in the topologically trivial phase, we reveal that under the Markov limit, the charging process of the QB is almost completely prohibited due to the emergence of degenerate zero-energy bound states. Moreover, we discover that the maximum energy storage exhibits singular behavior at the phase boundaries. Second, we find that direct coupling between the QB and quantum charger renders the ergotropy immune to sublattice dissipation, facilitated by the presence of a dark state and vacancy-like dressed bound state. Further, we show that as dissipation intensifies along with the emergence of the quantum Zeno effect, the charging power of QBs is transiently enhanced. Our findings provide insightful guidelines for practically enhancing the performance of QBs through structured reservoir engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present characterization and storage methods for a high-finesse nanofiber Fabry-Per\'{o}t resonator. Reflection spectroscopy from both ends of the resonator allows for evaluation of the mirror transmittances and optical loss inside the resonator. To maintain the quality of the nanofiber resonator after the fabrication, we have developed a portable storage container. By filling the container with dry, clean nitrogen gas, we can prevent contamination of the nanofiber during storage. This approach allows us to minimize the additional optical loss to less than 0.08% over a week. The portable container facilitates both the fabrication and subsequent experimentation with the resonator in different locations. This flexibility expands the range of applications, including quantum optics, communication, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive magnetocardiography of living rat based on diamond quantum sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetocardiography (MCG) has emerged as a sensitive and precise method to diagnose cardiovascular diseases, providing more diagnostic information than traditional technology. However, the sensor limitations of conventional MCG systems, such as large size and cryogenic requirement, have hindered the widespread application and in-depth understanding of this technology. In this study, we present a high-sensitivity, room-temperature MCG system based on the negatively charged Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The magnetic cardiac signal of a living rat, characterized by an approximately 20 pT amplitude in the R-wave, is successfully captured through non-invasive measurement using this innovative solid-state spin sensor. To detect these extremely weak biomagnetic signals, we utilize sensitivity-enhancing techniques such as magnetic flux concentration. These approaches have enabled us to simultaneously achieve a magnetometry sensitivity of 9 $\text{pT}\cdot \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ and a sensor scale of 5 $\text{mm}$. By extending the sensing scale of the NV centers from cellular and molecular level to macroscopic level of living creatures, we have opened the future of solid-state quantum sensing technologies in clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Emergent gravity from the correlation of spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ systems coupled with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces several ideas of emergent gravity, which come from a system similar to an ensemble of quantum spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ particles. To derive a physically relevant theory, the model is constructed by quantizing a scalar field in curved space-time. The quantization is based on a classical discretization of the system, but contrary to famous approaches, like loop quantum gravity or causal triangulation, a Monte-Carlo based approach is used instead of a simplicial approximation of the space-time manifold. This avoids conceptual issues related to the choice of the lattice. Moreover, this allows us to easily encode the geometric structures of space, given by the geodesic length between points, into the mean value of a correlation operator between two spin-like systems. Numerical investigations show the relevance of the approach, and the presence of two regimes: a classical and a quantum regime. The latter is obtained when the density of points reaches a given threshold. Finally, a multi-scale analysis is given, where the classical model is recovered from the full quantum one. Each step of the classical limit is illustrated with numerical computations, showing the very good convergence towards the classical limit and the computational efficiency of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical formulation of the thermodynamics, free energy and entropy, of any generic Bogoliubov de Genes model which develops exceptional point (EP) bifurcations in its complex spectrum when coupled to reservoirs. We apply our formalism to a non-Hermitian Josephson junction where, despite recent claims, the supercurrent does not exhibit any divergences at EPs. The entropy, on the contrary, shows a universal jump of $1/2\log 2$ which can be linked to the emergence of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at EPs. Our method allows us to obtain precise analytical boundaries for the temperatures at which such Majorana entropy steps appear. We propose a generalized Maxwell relation linking supercurrents and entropy which could pave the way towards the direct experimental observation of such steps in e.g. quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is not possible to concentrate enough light to precipitate the formation of an event horizon. We argue that the dissipative quantum effects coming from the self-interaction of light (such as vacuum polarization) are enough to prevent any meaningful buildup of energy that could create a black hole in any realistic scenario.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lepton-neutron potential in configuration space is obtained. It is based on the Coulomb plus hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian integrated over the neutron charge and magnetic densities. Different parametrisations of the neutron electromagnetic form factors are compared. It is given in the operator form with a central, spin-spin, tensor and spin-orbit terms. The potentials for lowest partial waves states are presented. We compute the lepton-neutron lepton ($ln$) low-energy parameters for the S-waves, estimate the zero-energy cross sections for higher angular momentum states, and point out a possible divergence in the partial wave summation due to the spin-orbit potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a unital completely positive map on the space of operators on some Hilbert space. We assume that $\Phi$ is almost idempotent, namely, $\|\Phi^2-\Phi\|_{\mathrm{cb}} \le\eta$, and construct a corresponding "$\varepsilon$-$C^*$ algebra" for $\varepsilon=O(\eta)$. This type of structure has the axioms of a unital $C^*$ algebra but the associativity and other axioms involving the multiplication and the unit hold up to $\varepsilon$. We further prove that any finite-dimensional $\varepsilon$-$C^*$ algebra is $O(\varepsilon)$-isomorphic to a genuine $C^*$ algebra. These bounds are universal, i.e.\ do not depend on the dimensionality or other parameters.</description>

      <title>Site-Controlled Purcell-Induced Bright Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single photon emitters (SPEs) hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are essential elementary building blocks for enabling future on-chip quantum photonic technologies that operate at room temperature. However, fundamental challenges, such as managing non-radiative decay, competing incoherent processes, as well as engineering difficulties in achieving deterministic placement and scaling of the emitters, limit their full potential. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate large-area arrays of plasmonic nanoresonators for Purcell-induced site-controlled SPEs by engineering emitter-cavity coupling and enhancing radiative emission at room temperature. The plasmonic nanoresonator architecture consists of gold-coated silicon pillars capped with an alumina spacer layer, enabling a 10-fold local field enhancement in the emission band of native hBN defects. Confocal photoluminescence and second-order autocorrelation measurements show bright SPEs with sub-30 meV bandwidth and a saturated emission rate of more than 3.8 million counts per second. We measure a Purcell factor of 4.9, enabling average SPE lifetimes of 480 ps, a five-fold reduction as compared to emission from gold-free devices, along with an overall SPE yield of 21%. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the beneficial role of an alumina spacer between defected hBN and gold, as an insulating layer can mitigate the electronic broadening of emission from defects proximal to gold. Our results offer arrays of bright, heterogeneously integrated quantum light sources, paving the way for robust and scalable quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of emergent cluster states by measurement from symmetry-protected-topological states with large symmetry to subsystem cat state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose measurement-producing hierarchy emerging among correlated states by sequential subsystem projective measurements. We start from symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) cluster states with a large symmetry and apply sequential subsystem projective measurements to them and find that generalized cluster SPT states with a reduced symmetry appear in the subsystem of the unmeasured sites. That prescription finally produces Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger states with long-range order in the subsystem composed of periodic unmeasured sites of the original lattice. The symmetry-reduction hierarchical structure from a general large symmetric SPT cluster state is clearly captured by the measurement update flow in the efficient algorithm of stabilizer formalism. This approach is useful not only for the analytical search for the measured state but also for numerical simulation with a large system size. We also numerically verify the symmetry-reduction hierarchy by sequential subsystem projective measurements applied to large systems and large symmetric cluster SPT states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher- order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A parametrically modulated oscillator has two opposite-phase vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. An extra force at the vibration frequency breaks the symmetry of the states. The effect can be extremely strong due to the interplay between the force and the quantum fluctuations resulting from the coupling of the oscillator to a thermal bath. The force changes the rates of the fluctuation-induced walk over the quantum states of the oscillator. If the number of the states is large, the effect accumulates to an exponentially large factor in the rate of switching between the vibrational states. We find the factor and analyze it in the limiting cases. We show that in the zero-temperature limit the extra force breaks the detailed balance, leading to a nonperturbatively strong increase of the switching rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we define Odzijewicz, Berezin and Fedosov-type quantization on compact smooth manifolds. The method is as follows. We embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ (and in the Fedosov quantization case embed into any real $2n$ dimensional symplectic manifold). The pullback coherent states are defined in the usual way. In the Odzijewicz-type, Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of geometric quantization is the pullback by the embedding of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Kohinoor Ghosh (where we had needed totally real embedding). The Fedosov-type quantization is carried out by restriction to the submanifold given by the embedding.</description>

Abstract: The discussion in this study delves into Dirac's bra-ket formalism for a quasi-Hermitian quantum composite system based on the rigged Hilbert space (RHS). We establish an RHS with a positive definite metric suitable for a quasi-Hermite composite system. The obtained RHS is utilized to construct the bra and ket vectors for the non-Hermite composite system and produce the spectral decomposition of the quasi-Hermitian operator. We show that the symmetric relations regarding quasi-Hermitian operators can be extended to dual spaces, and all descriptions obtained using the bra-ket formalism are completely developed in the dual spaces. Our methodology is applied to a non-Hermitian harmonic oscillator composed of conformal multi-dimensional many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atoms exhibit remarkable sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, making them promising candidates for revolutionizing field sensors. Unlike conventional antennas, they neither disturb the measured field nor necessitate intricate calibration procedures. In this study, we propose a protocol for signal reception near the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, harnessing the capabilities of warm Rydberg atoms. Our focus lies on exploring various quadrature amplitude modulations and transmission frequencies through heterodyne detection. We offer a comprehensive characterization of our setup, encompassing the atomic response frequency range and attainable electric field amplitudes. Additionally, we delve into analyzing communication errors using Voronoi diagrams, along with evaluating the communication channel capacity across different modulation schemes. Our findings not only lay the groundwork for future wireless communication applications, but also present opportunities to refine protocols in classical communication and field sensing domains.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Momentum Spectra of pair created in a pulsed field at finite times: Are Oscillations "Real"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of electron-positron pairs from the vacuum in a time-varying, spatially uniform pulsed electric field given by $E(t) = E_0 sech^2(t/\tau)$, with height of $E_0$ and width of $\tau$. Sah recently discussed the problem of pair production after a finite evolution time [9]. This raises questions about the instantaneous appearance of particles in pair production and their behavior at intermediate times when using a formalism that involves solving an evolution equation for a dynamical quantity. Is it possible to make general statements about this behavior? To address these questions, we analytically compute the probability of $(e^+ e^-)$ pair production in momentum space using the exact solution of the one-particle time-dependent Dirac equation, and we compare the result with quantum kinetic theory (QKT). Both approaches allow us to study the particle momentum spectrum at any instant in time and can potentially unveil valuable information regarding quantum non-equilibrium physics. We analyze both approaches' Longitudinal Momentum Spectrum (LMS) of the created particles at finite times. We observe oscillatory structure in the LMS. This oscillation behavior at finite time clearly illustrates the quantum interference effects associated with particle production. It is worth noting that both approaches exhibit quantum interference patterns at finite times, manifested as oscillations observed in the LMS. This reveals that these oscillations are not due to transient excitations and basis-dependent signatures. Again, we emphasize that the oscillations seen in the LMS from both approaches are not artifacts but possess significant physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Polarization Purity and Dispersion Characteristics of Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Hollow-Core Optical Fiber at Near- and Mid-IR Wavelengths for Quantum Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum communication and sensing require improved optical transmission that ensures excellent state purity and reduced losses. While free-space optical communication is often preferred, its use becomes challenging over long distances due to beam divergence, atmospheric absorption, scattering, and turbulence, among other factors. In the case of polarization encoding, traditional silica-core optical fibers, though commonly used, struggle with maintaining state purity due to stress-induced birefringence. Hollow core fibers, and in particular nested antiresonant fibers (NANF), have recently been shown to possess unparalleled polarization purity with minimal birefringence in the telecom wavelength range using continuous-wave (CW) laser light. Here, we investigate a 1-km NANF designed for wavelengths up to the 2-{\mu}m waveband. Our results show a polarization extinction ratio between ~-30 dB and ~-70 dB across the 1520 to 1620 nm range in CW operation, peaking at ~-60 dB at the 2-{\mu}m design wavelength. Our study also includes the pulsed regime, providing insights beyond previous CW studies, e.g., on the propagation of broadband quantum states of light in NANF at 2 {\mu}m, and corresponding extinction-ratio-limited quantum bit-error rates (QBER) for prepare-measure and entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Our findings highlight the potential of these fibers in emerging applications such as QKD, pointing towards a new standard in optical quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of quantum point contacts defined in a high-quality strained germanium quantum well with layered electric gates. At zero magnetic field, we observe quantized conductance plateaus in units of 2$e^2/h$. Bias-spectroscopy measurements reveal that the energy spacing between successive one-dimensional subbands ranges from 1.5 to 5\,meV as a consequence of the small effective mass of the holes and the narrow gate constrictions. At finite magnetic fields perpendicular to the device plane, the edges of the conductance plateaus get splitted due to the Zeeman effect and Land\'{e} $g$ factors are estimated to be $\sim6.6$ for the holes in the germanium quantum well. We demonstrate that all quantum point contacts in the same device have comparable performances, indicating a reliable and reproducible device fabrication process. Thus, our work lays a foundation for investigating multiple forefronts of physics in germanium-based quantum devices that require quantum point contacts as a building block.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of experiments exploring resonances in the collision of ultracold clouds of atoms. Using a laser-based accelerator that capitalizes on the energy resolution provided by the ultracold atomic setting, we unveil resonance phenomena such as Feshbach and shape resonances in their quintessential form by literally photographing the halo of outgoing scattered atoms. We exploit the tunability of magnetic Feshbach resonances to instigate an interplay between scattering resonances. By experimentally recording the scattering in a parameter space spanned by collision energy and magnetic field, we capture the imprint of the $S$-matrix pole flow in the complex energy plane. After revisiting experiments that place a Feshbach resonance in the proximity of a shape resonance and an anti-bound state, respectively, we discuss the possibility of using $S$-matrix pole interplay between two Feshbach resonances to create a bound-state-in-the-continuum.</description>

      <title>Fundamental role of nonlocal orders in 1D Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal order parameters capture the presence of correlated fluctuations between specific degrees of freedom, in otherwise disordered quantum matter. Here we provide a further example of their fundamental role, deriving the ground state phase diagram of the filling one extended Bose Hubbard model exclusively in terms of their ordering. By means of a density matrix renormalization group numerical analysis, we show that besides the (even) parity order characteristic of the Mott insulating phase, and the string order non vanishing in the Haldane insulator, the recently proposed odd parity order completes the picture, becoming nonvanishing at the transition from the normal superfluid to the paired superfluid phase. The above three nonlocal parameters capture all the distinct phases, including the density wave phase which local order is seen as the simultaneous presence of correlated fluctuations in different channels. They provide a unique tool for the experimental observation of the full phase diagram of strongly correlated quantum matter, by means of local density measurements.</description>

      <title>Flux-Tunable Regimes and Supersymmetry in Twisted Cuprate Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Van der Waals assembly allows for the creation of Josephson junctions in an atomically sharp interface between two exfoliated Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) flakes that are twisted relative to each other. In a narrow range of angles close to $45^\circ$, the junction exhibits a regime where time-reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken and it can be used to encode an inherently protected qubit called flowermon. In this work we investigate the physics emerging when two such junctions are integrated in a SQuID circuit threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the flowermon qubit regime is maintained up to a finite critical value of the magnetic field and, under appropriate conditions, it is protected against both charge and flux noise. For larger external fluxes, the interplay between the inherent twisted d-wave nature of the order parameter and the external magnetic flux enables the implementation of different artificial atoms, including a flux-biased protected qubit and a supersymmetric quantum circuit.</description>

      <title>Towards Utilizing Scanning Gate Microscopy as a High-Resolution Probe of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed understanding of the material properties that affect the splitting between the two low-lying valley states in Si/SiGe heterostructures will be increasingly important as the number of spin qubits is increased. Scanning gate microscopy has been proposed as a method to measure the spatial variation of the valley splitting as a tip-induced dot is moved around in the plane of the Si quantum well. We develop a simulation using an electrostatic model of the scanning gate microscope tip and the overlapping gate structure combined with an approximate solution to the three-dimensional Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation in the device stack. Using this simulation, we show that a tip-induced quantum dot formed near source and drain electrodes can be adiabatically moved to a region far from the gate electrodes. We argue that by spatially translating the tip-induced dot across a defect in the Si/SiGe interface, changes in valley splitting can be detected.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in selected Binary Tree States: Dicke/Total spin states, particle number projected BCS states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary Tree States (BTS) are states whose decomposition on a quantum register basis formed by a set of qubits can be made sequentially. Such states sometimes appear naturally in many-body systems treated in Fock space when a global symmetry is imposed, like the total spin or particle number symmetries. Examples are the Dicke states, the eigenstates of the total spin for a set of particles having individual spin $1/2$, or states obtained by projecting a BCS states onto particle number, also called projected BCS in small superfluid systems. Starting from a BTS state described on the set of $n$ qubits or orbitals, the entanglement entropy of any subset of $ k$ qubits is analyzed. Specifically, a practical method is developed to access the $k$ qubits/particles von Neumann entanglement entropy of the subsystem of interest. Properties of these entropies are discussed, including scaling properties, upper bounds, or how these entropies correlate with fluctuations. Illustrations are given for the Dicke state and the projected BCS states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information and quantum foundations are becoming popular topics for advanced undergraduate courses. Many of the fundamental concepts and applications in these two fields, such as delayed choice experiments and quantum encryption, are comprehensible to undergraduates with basic knowledge of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we show that the quantum eraser, usually used to study the duality between wave and particle properties, can also serve as a generic platform for quantum key distribution. We present a pedagogical example of an algorithm to securely share random keys using the quantum eraser platform and propose its implementation with quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for efficiently cooling many-body quantum systems with unknown Hamiltonians down to their ground states with a high fidelity. The technique involves initially applying a strong external field followed by a sequence of single-degree-of-freedom (single-qubit) measurements and radiofrequency (RF) pulses to polarize the system along the field direction. Subsequently, the field is adiabatically switched off, allowing the system to evolve towards its ground state as governed by the quantum adiabatic theorem.
  We present numerical simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the technique applied to quantum spin chains with long-range and short-range interactions as prototypes for many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of qudit gates and effects of spectator modes on optimal control pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qudit gates for high-dimensional quantum computing can be synthesized with high precision using numerical quantum optimal control techniques. Large circuits are broken down into modules and the tailored pulses for each module can be used as primitives for a qudit compiler. Application of the pulses of each module in the presence of extra modes may decrease their effectiveness due to crosstalk. In this paper, we address this problem by simulating qudit dynamics for circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems. As a test case, we take pulses for single-qudit SWAP gates optimized in isolation and then apply them in the presence of spectator modes each of which are in Fock states. We provide an experimentally relevant scaling formula that can be used as a bound on the fidelity decay. Our results show that frequency shift from spectator mode populations has to be $\lesssim 0.1\%$ of the qudit's nonlinearity in order for high-fidelity single-qudit gates to be useful in the presence of occupied spectator modes.</description>

      <title>QuACK: Accelerating Gradient-Based Quantum Optimization with Koopman Operator Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optimization, a key application of quantum computing, has traditionally been stymied by the linearly increasing complexity of gradient calculations with an increasing number of parameters. This work bridges the gap between Koopman operator theory, which has found utility in applications because it allows for a linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems, and natural gradient methods in quantum optimization, leading to a significant acceleration of gradient-based quantum optimization. We present Quantum-circuit Alternating Controlled Koopman learning (QuACK), a novel framework that leverages an alternating algorithm for efficient prediction of gradient dynamics on quantum computers. We demonstrate QuACK's remarkable ability to accelerate gradient-based optimization across a range of applications in quantum optimization and machine learning. In fact, our empirical studies, spanning quantum chemistry, quantum condensed matter, quantum machine learning, and noisy environments, have shown accelerations of more than 200x speedup in the overparameterized regime, 10x speedup in the smooth regime, and 3x speedup in the non-smooth regime. With QuACK, we offer a robust advancement that harnesses the advantage of gradient-based quantum optimization for practical benefits.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a theory of parametric photon generation in the waveguides coupled to arrays of quantum emitters with temporally modulated resonance frequencies. Such generation can be interpreted as a dynamical Casimir effect. We demonstrate numerically and analytically how the emission directionality and photon-photon correlations can be controlled by the phases of the modulation. The emission spectrum is shown to be strongly dependent on the anharmonicity of the emitter potential. Single- and double-excited state resonances have been identified in the emission spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide range of applications require, by hypothesis, to have access to a high-speed, private, and genuine random source. Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) are currently the sole technology capable of producing true randomness. However, the bulkiness of current implementations significantly limits their adoption. In this work, we present a high-performance source-device independent QRNG leveraging a custom made integrated photonic chip. The proposed scheme exploits the properties of a heterodyne receiver to enhance security and integration to promote spatial footprint reduction while simplifying its implementation. This characteristics could represents a significant advancement toward the development of generators better suited to meet the demands of portable and space applications. The system can deliver secure random numbers at a rate greater than 20 Gbps with a reduced spatial and power footprint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of complex quantum many-body systems is a promising short-term goal of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the limited connectivity of native qubits hinders the implementation of quantum algorithms that require long-range interactions. We present the outcomes of a digital quantum simulation where we overcome the limitations of the qubit connectivity in NISQ devices. Utilizing the universality of quantum processor native gates, we demonstrate how to implement couplings among physically disconnected qubits at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We apply this method to simulate a Floquet-driven quantum spin chain featuring interactions beyond nearest neighbors. Specifically, we benchmark the prethermal stabilization of the discrete Floquet time-crystalline response as the interaction range increases, a phenomenon never observed experimentally. Our quantum simulation addresses one of the significant limitations of superconducting quantum processors, namely, device connectivity. It reveals that nontrivial physics involving couplings beyond nearest neighbors can be extracted after the impact of noise is properly taken into account in the theoretical model and consequently mitigated from the experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose efficient algorithms for classically simulating fermionic linear optics operations applied to non-Gaussian initial states. By gadget constructions, this provides algorithms for fermionic linear optics with non-Gaussian operations. We argue that this problem is analogous to that of simulating Clifford circuits with non-stabilizer initial states: Algorithms for the latter problem immediately translate to the fermionic setting. Our construction is based on an extension of the covariance matrix formalism which permits to efficiently track relative phases in superpositions of Gaussian states. It yields simulation algorithms with polynomial complexity in the number of fermions, the desired accuracy, and certain quantities capturing the degree of non-Gaussianity of the initial state. We study one such quantity, the fermionic Gaussian extent, and show that it is multiplicative on tensor products when the so-called fermionic Gaussian fidelity is. We establish this property for the tensor product of two arbitrary pure states of four fermions with positive parity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum coherence is one of the fundamental aspects distinguishing classical and quantum theories. Coherence between different energy eigenstates is particularly important, as it serves as a valuable resource under the law of energy conservation. A fundamental question in this setting is how well one can prepare good coherent states from low coherent states and whether a given coherent state is convertible to another one. Here, we show that any low coherent state is convertible to any high coherent state arbitrarily well in two operational settings: asymptotic and catalytic transformations. For a variant of asymptotic coherence manipulation where one aims to prepare desired states in local subsystems, the rate of transformation becomes unbounded regardless of how weak the initial coherence is. In a non-asymptotic transformation with a catalyst, a helper state that locally remains in the original form after the transformation, we show that an arbitrary state can be obtained from any low coherent state. Applying this to the standard asymptotic setting, we find that a catalyst can increase the coherence distillation rate significantly -- from zero to infinite rate. We also prove that such anomalous transformation requires small but non-zero coherence in relevant modes, establishing the condition under which a sharp transition of the operational capability occurs. Our results provide a general characterization of the coherence transformability in these operational settings and showcase their peculiar properties compared to other common resource theories such as entanglement and quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Tetris: A Compilation Framework for VQA Applications in Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has shown promise in solving complex problems by leveraging the principles of superposition and entanglement. Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a class of algorithms suited for near term quantum computers due to their modest requirements of qubits and depths of computation. This paper introduces Tetris, a compilation framework for VQA applications on near term quantum devices. Tetris focuses on reducing two qubit gates in the compilation process since a two qubit gate has an order of magnitude more significant error and execution time than a single qubit gate. Tetris exploits unique opportunities in the circuit synthesis stage often overlooked by the state of the art VQA compilers for reducing the number of two qubit gates. Tetris comes with a refined IR of Pauli string to express such a two qubit gate optimization opportunity. Moreover, Tetris is equipped with a fast bridging approach that mitigates the hardware mapping cost. Overall, Tetris demonstrates a reduction of up to 41.3 percent in CNOT gate counts, 37.9 percent in circuit depth, and 42.6 percent in circuit duration for various molecules of different sizes and structures compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. Tetris is open-sourced at this link.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum many-body mixed states with a symmetry from the perspective of separability, i.e., whether a mixed state can be expressed as an ensemble of short-range entangled (SRE) symmetric pure states. We provide evidence for 'symmetry-enforced separability transitions' in a variety of states, where in one regime the mixed state is expressible as a convex sum of symmetric SRE pure states, while in the other regime, such a representation is not feasible. We first discuss Gibbs state of Hamiltonians that exhibit spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry, and argue that the associated thermal phase transition can be thought of as a symmetry-enforced separability transition. Next, we study cluster states in various dimensions subjected to local decoherence, and identify several distinct mixed-state phases and associated separability phase transitions, which also provides an alternate perspective on recently discussed 'average SPT order'. We also study decohered p+ip superconductors, and find that if the decoherence breaks the fermion parity explicitly, then the resulting mixed state can be expressed as a convex sum of non-chiral states, while a fermion-parity preserving decoherence results in a phase transition at a non-zero threshold that corresponds to spontaneous breaking of fermion parity. Finally, we briefly discuss systems that satisfy NLTS (no low-energy trivial state) property, such as the recently discovered good LDPC codes, and argue that the Gibbs state of such systems exhibits a temperature-tuned separability transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a random search technique to find quantum gate sequences that implement perfect quantum state preparation or unitary operator synthesis with arbitrary targets. This approach is based on the recent discovery that there is a large multiplicity of quantum circuits that achieve unit fidelity in performing a given target operation, even at the minimum number of single-qubit and two-qubit gates needed to achieve unit fidelity. We show that the fraction of perfect-fidelity quantum circuits increases rapidly as soon as the circuit size exceeds the minimum circuit size required for achieving unit fidelity. This result implies that near-optimal quantum circuits for a variety of quantum information processing tasks can be identified relatively easily by trying only a few randomly chosen quantum circuits and optimizing their parameters. In addition to analyzing the case where the CNOT gate is the elementary two-qubit gate, we consider the possibility of using alternative two-qubit gates. In particular, we analyze the case where the two-qubit gate is the B gate, which is known to reduce the minimum quantum circuit size for two-qubit operations. We apply the random search method to the problem of decomposing the 4-qubit Toffoli gate and find a 15 CNOT-gate decomposition.</description>

      <title>Device-Independent Quantum Secure Direct Communication Under Non-Markovian Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum secure direct communication (DI-QSDC) is a promising primitive in quantum cryptography aimed towards addressing the problems of device imperfections and key management. However, significant effort is required to tackle practical challenges such as the distance limitation due to the decohering effects of quantum channels. Here, we explore the constructive effect of non-Markovian noise to improve the performance of DI-QSDC. Considering two different environmental dynamics modelled by the amplitude damping and the dephasing channels, we show that for both cases non-Markovianty leads to a considerable improvement over Markovian dynamics in terms of three benchmark performance criteria of the DI-QSDC task. Specifically, we find that non-Markovian noise (i) enhances the protocol security measured by Bell violation, (ii) leads to a lower quantum bit error rate, and (iii) enables larger communication distances by increasing the capacity of secret communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the time evolution of complexity in quantum systems entails evaluating the spreading of the system's state across a defined basis in its corresponding Hilbert space. Recently, the Krylov basis has been identified as the one that minimizes this spreading. In this study, we develop a numerical exploration of the Krylov complexity in quantum states following a quench in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Our results reveal that the long-term averaged Krylov complexity acts as an order parameter for this model. It effectively discriminates between the two dynamic phases induced by the quench, sharing a critical point with the conventional order parameter. Additionally, we examine the inverse participation ratio and the Shannon entropy in both the Krylov basis and the energy basis. A matching dynamic behavior is observed in both bases when the initial state possesses a specific symmetry. This behavior is analytically explained by establishing the equivalence between the Krylov basis and the pre-quench energy eigenbasis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the competition between Haar-random unitary dynamics and measurements for unstructured systems of qubits. For projective measurements, we derive various properties of the statistical ensemble of Kraus operators analytically, including the purification time and the distribution of Born probabilities. The latter generalizes the Porter-Thomas distribution for random unitary circuits to the monitored setting and is log-normal at long times. We also consider weak measurements that interpolate between identity quantum channels and projective measurements. In this setting, we derive an exactly solvable Fokker-Planck equation for the joint distribution of singular values of Kraus operators, analogous to the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation modelling disordered quantum wires. We expect that the statistical properties of Kraus operators we have established for these simple systems will serve as a model for the entangling phase of monitored quantum systems more generally.</description>

Abstract: The effects of Aharonov-Casher (AC) and He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) phases on entangled spin-1/2 quantum systems are investigated. We use linear charge distributions positioned at the center of resulting closed orbits, capitalizing on Mach Zender-type interferometers modified with phase retarders to unveil the topological effects. We analyze how AC-HMW phases influence the Bell angles and maximal violation of Bell-CHSH inequalities (BI) without any classical interaction. We incorporate the spin and path of particles in the interferometers as observables to test noncontextual hidden variable theories against quantum mechanics, leveraging the non-local features of AC-HMW effects. Furthermore, we discuss potential implementations of our scheme in physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many alternative approaches to construct quantum channels with large entangling capacities were proposed in the past decade, resulting in multiple isolated gates. In this work, we put forward a novel one, inspired by convolution, which provides greater freedom of nonlocal parameters. Although quantum counterparts of convolution have been shown not to exist for pure states, several attempts with various degrees of rigorousness have been proposed for mixed states. In this work, we follow the approach based on coherifications of multi-stochastic operations and demonstrate a surprising connection to gates with high entangling power. In particular, we identify conditions necessary for the convolutional channels constructed using our method to possess maximal entangling power. Furthermore, we establish new, continuous classes of bipartite 2-unitary matrices of dimension $d^2$ for $d = 7$ and $d = 9$, with $2$ and $4$ free nonlocal parameters beyond simple phasing of matrix elements, corresponding to perfect tensors of rank $4$ or 4-partite absolutely maximally entangled states.</description>

      <title>Encoding position by spins: Objectivity in the boson-spin model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum objectivity in the boson-spin model, where a central harmonic oscillator interacts with a thermal bath of spin-1/2 systems. We analyze how information about a continuous position variable can be encoded into discrete, finite-dimensional environments. More precisely, we study conditions under which the so-called Spectrum Broadcast Structures (SBS) can be formed in the model. These are multipartite quantum state structures, representing a mode-refined form of decoherence. Working in the recoil-less limit, we use the Floquet theory to show that despite its apparent simplicity, the model has a rich structure with different regimes, depending on the motion of the central system. In one of them, the faithful encoding of the position and hence objectivity are impossible irrespectively of the resources used. In other, large enough collections of spins will faithfully encode the position information. We derive the characteristic length scales, corresponding to decoherence and precision of the encoding.</description>

Abstract: We showcase the digital quantum simulation of the action of a Hamiltonian that governs the interaction between a quantum mechanical oscillator and an optical field, generating quantum entanglement between them via gravitational effects. This is achieved by making use of a boson-qubit mapping protocol and a digital gate decomposition that allow us to run the simulations in the quantum computers available in the IBM Quantum platform. We present the obtained results for the fidelity of the experiment in two different quantum computers, after applying error mitigation and post-selection techniques. The achieved results correspond to fidelities over 90%, which indicates that we were able to perform a faithful digital quantum simulation of the interaction and therefore of the generation of quantum entanglement by gravitational means in optomechanical systems.</description>

Abstract: We geometrically derive the explicit form of the Unitary representation of the Poincare group and use it to apply speed-of-light boosts to simple polarization basis to end up with Hawton-Baylis photon position operator with commuting components. We give explicit formulas for other photon boost eigenmodes. We investigate the underlying affine connections on the light cone in momentum space and find that while Pryce connection is metric semi-symmetric, the flat Hawton-Baylis connection is not semi-symmetric. Finally we discuss localizability of photon states localized on closed loops and show that photon states on the circle, both unnormalized improper states and finite norm wave packet smeared over washer-like regions are strictly localized with respect to Hawton-Baylis operators with commuting components and also with respect to the noncommutative Jauch-Piron-Amrein POV measure.</description>

      <title>Towards enhancing quantum expectation estimation of matrices through partial Pauli decomposition techniques and post-processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an approach for estimating the expectation values of arbitrary $n$-qubit matrices $M \in \mathbb{C}^{2^n\times 2^n}$ on a quantum computer. In contrast to conventional methods like the Pauli decomposition that utilize $4^n$ distinct quantum circuits for this task, our technique employs at most $2^n$ unique circuits, with even fewer required for matrices with limited bandwidth. Termed the \textit{partial Pauli decomposition}, our method involves observables formed as the Kronecker product of a single-qubit Pauli operator and orthogonal projections onto the computational basis. By measuring each such observable, one can simultaneously glean information about $2^n$ distinct entries of $M$ through post-processing of the measurement counts. This reduction in quantum resources is especially crucial in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, offering the potential to accelerate quantum algorithms that rely heavily on expectation estimation, such as the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm.</description>

Abstract: The Schwinger model describes quantum electrodynamics in 1+1-dimensions, it is a prototype for quantum chromodynamics, and its lattice version allows for a quantum link model description that can be simulated using modern quantum devices. In this work, we devise quantum simulations to investigate the dynamics of this model in its low dimensional form, where the gauge field degrees of freedom are described by spin 1/2 operators. We apply trotterization to write quantum circuits that effectively generate the evolution under the Schwinger model Hamiltonian. We consider both sequential circuits, with a fixed gate sequence, and randomized ones. Utilizing the correspondence between the Schwinger model and the PXP model, known for its quantum scars, we investigate the presence of quantum scar states in the Schwinger model by identifying states exhibiting extended thermalization times in our circuit evolutions. Our comparison of sequential and randomized circuit dynamics shows that the non-thermal sector of the Hilbert space, including the scars, are more sensitive to randomization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of conditional mutual information in generic open quantum systems, focusing on one-dimensional random circuits with interspersed local noise. Unlike in noiseless circuits, where conditional mutual information spreads linearly while being bounded by the lightcone, we find that noisy random circuits with an error rate $p$ exhibit superlinear propagation of conditional mutual information, which diverges far beyond the lightcone at a critical circuit depth $t_c \propto p^{-1}$. We demonstrate that the underlying mechanism for such rapid spreading is the combined effect of local noise and a scrambling unitary, which selectively removes short-range correlations while preserving long-range correlations. To analytically capture the dynamics of conditional mutual information in noisy random circuits, we introduce a coarse-graining method, and we validate our theoretical results through numerical simulations. Furthermore, we identify a universal scaling law governing the spreading of conditional mutual information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Running quantum algorithms protected by quantum error correction requires a real time, classical decoder. To prevent the accumulation of a backlog, this decoder must process syndromes from the quantum device at a faster rate than they are generated. Most prior work on real time decoding has focused on an isolated logical qubit encoded in the surface code. However, for surface code, quantum programs of utility will require multi-qubit interactions performed via lattice surgery. A large merged patch can arise during lattice surgery -- possibly as large as the entire device. This puts a significant strain on a real time decoder, which must decode errors on this merged patch and maintain the level of fault-tolerance that it achieves on isolated logical qubits.
  These requirements are relaxed by using spatially parallel decoding, which can be accomplished by dividing the physical qubits on the device into multiple overlapping groups and assigning a decoder module to each. We refer to this approach as spatially parallel windows. While previous work has explored similar ideas, none have addressed system-specific considerations pertinent to the task or the constraints from using hardware accelerators. In this work, we demonstrate how to configure spatially parallel windows, so that the scheme (1) is compatible with hardware accelerators, (2) supports general lattice surgery operations, (3) maintains the fidelity of the logical qubits, and (4) meets the throughput requirement for real time decoding. Furthermore, our results reveal the importance of optimally choosing the buffer width to achieve a balance between accuracy and throughput -- a decision that should be influenced by the device's physical noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of many-body quantum systems using Rydberg-atom platforms has become of extreme interest in the last years. The possibility to realize spin Hamiltonians and the accurate control at the single atom level paved the way for the study of quantum phases of matter and dynamics. Here, we propose a quantum optimal control protocol to engineer current states: quantum states characterized by Rydberg excitations propagating in a given spatially closed tweezer networks. Indeed, current states with different winding numbers can be generated on demand. Besides those ones with single winding number, superposition of quantum current states characterized by more winding numbers can be obtained. The single current states are eigenstates of the current operator that therefore can define an observable that remains persistent at any time. In particular, the features of the excitations dynamics reflects the nature of current states, a fact that in principle can be used to characterize the nature of the flow experimentally without the need of accessing high order correlators.</description>

Abstract: This note derives the stochastic differential equations and partial differential equation of general hybrid quantum-classical dynamics from the theory of continuous measurement and general (non-Markovian) feedback. The advantage of this approach is an explicit parameterization, without additional positivity constraints. The construction also neatly separates the different effects: how the quantum influences the classical and how the classical influences the quantum. This modular presentation gives a better intuition of what to expect from hybrid dynamics, especially when used to construct possibly fundamental theories.</description>

      <title>The power of a single Haar random state: constructing and separating quantum pseudorandomness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the following question: what are the cryptographic implications of having access to an oracle that provides a single Haar random quantum state? We show, perhaps surprisingly, that such an oracle is sufficient to construct quantum pseudorandomness.
  Pseudorandom states (PRS) are a family of states for which it is hard to distinguish between polynomially many copies of either a state sampled uniformly from the family or a Haar random state. A weaker notion, called single-copy pseudorandom states (1PRS), satisfies this property with respect to a single copy. Our main result is that 1PRS (as well as bit-commitments) exist relative to an oracle that provides a single Haar random state. We build on this result to show the existence of an oracle relative to which 1PRS exist, but PRS do not. This provides one of the first black-box separations between different forms of quantum pseudorandomness.</description>

Abstract: Explicit mathematical reconstructions of quantum networks play a significant role in developing quantum information science. However, tremendous parameter requirements and physical constraint implementations have become computationally non-ignorable encumbrances. In this work, we propose an efficient method for quantum network tomography by learning isometries on the Stiefel manifold. Tasks of reconstructing quantum networks are tackled by solving a series of unconstrained optimization problems with significantly less parameters. The stepwise isometry estimation shows the capability for providing information of the truncated quantum comb while processing the tomography. Remarkably, this method enables the compressive quantum comb tomography by specifying the dimensions of isometries. As a result, our proposed method exhibits high accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Erasure-tolerance scheme for the surface codes on Rydberg atomic quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atom array with optical tweezers is a promising candidate for a fault-tolerant quantum computer, thanks to its good properties such as scalability, long coherence time and optical accessibility for communication. A big barrier to overcome is non-Pauli errors, erasure errors and leakage errors. Conventional work has revealed that leakage error is convertible to erasure error. A remaining problem is that such (converted) erasure errors continuously happen and accumulate. The previous proposal involved transporting atoms directly from the reservoir area, where atoms are stored for spare, to the computational area, where the computation and the error correction are processed, to correct atom loss. However, transporting atoms takes a long time and has side effects on surrounding qubits in practice. In this study, we evaluate the effects on planar code by circuit-based Monte Carlo simulation which has depolarizing errors and erasure errors, and propose a new scheme to tolerate that problem, namely, k-shift erasure recovery scheme. Our scheme uses online code deformation to tolerate erasures and repeatedly transfers the logical qubit from an imperfect array in which erasure errors accumulated to another perfect array in which erasure errors have been fixed by offline optical tweezers, to tolerate a large (accumulated) number of erasures. Furthermore, our scheme corrects erasure errors of atom arrays while logical qubits are evacuated from that area to correct; therefore, manipulating optical tweezers for erasure correction does not disturb qubits that compose logical data. We believe that our scheme provides practical directions for Rydberg atom quantum computers to realize feasible fault-tolerance.</description>

      <title>General protocols for the efficient distillation of indistinguishable photons</title>

Abstract: Highly pure and indistinguishable photons are a prerequisite for use in quantum information processing. We introduce protocols for the distillation of indistinguishable photons that offer a significant improvement over previous work, reducing distinguishability error rates by a factor of $n$, with resource requirements scaling linearly in $n$. We present the protocols, based on the discrete Fourier transform, Hadamard (Sylvester) matrices, and more general Fourier transforms on finite abelian groups, then give both analytical and numerical results regarding their performance. We observe that the same symmetry properties governing suppression laws are instrumental in understanding the behavior of these distillation protocols. We also prove that for the $n$-photon discrete Fourier transform, the suppression laws are exactly characterized by the well-known Zero Transmission Law based on permutation symmetry if and only if $n$ is a prime power.</description>

      <title>Photon distillation schemes with reduced resource costs based on multiphoton Fourier interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the indistinguishability of single photons is a crucial prerequisite for achieving large-scale photonic quantum computation. Photon distillation uses quantum interference to enhance the quality of single photons, sacrificing multiple photons to generate one photon with enhanced indistinguishability. By studying multiphoton interference in Fourier matrices, we find photon distillation schemes that require fewer photons to achieve the same improvement in indistinguishability, compared to the state of the art. These results may find application as a component in large-scale photonic quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mediated Semi-Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Using Single Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new efficient mediated semi-quantum key distribution (MSQKD) protocol, facilitating the establishment of a shared secret key between two classical participants with the assistance of an untrusted third party (TP). Unlike existing MSQKD protocols, our approach significantly reduces the quantum requirements for TP, who only needs to prepare and measure qubits in the $X$ basis. Meanwhile, the classical participants are limited to preparing and measuring qubits in the $Z$ basis, along with performing Hadamard operations. This reduction in quantum overhead enhances the practicality of our MSQKD protocol without compromising qubit efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate the security of our protocol against various well-known attacks.</description>

      <title>Existence of Schrodinger Evolution with Absorbing Boundary Condition</title>

Abstract: Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function inside a region $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, and suppose that detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. The question how to compute the probability distribution of the time at which the detector surface registers the particle boils down to finding a reasonable mathematical definition of an ideal detecting surface; a particularly convincing definition, called the absorbing boundary rule, involves a time evolution for the particle's wave function $\psi$ expressed by a Schrodinger equation in $\Omega$ together with an "absorbing" boundary condition on $\partial \Omega$ first considered by Werner in 1987, viz., $\partial \psi/\partial n=i\kappa\psi$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ and $\partial/\partial n$ the normal derivative. We provide here a discussion of the rigorous mathematical foundation of this rule. First, for the viability of the rule it plays a crucial role that these two equations together uniquely define the time evolution of $\psi$; we point out here how the Hille-Yosida theorem implies that the time evolution is well defined and given by a contraction semigroup. Second, we show that the collapse required for the $N$-particle version of the problem is well defined. Finally, we also prove analogous results for the Dirac equation.</description>

      <title>The Quadruplon in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of matter or materials and interaction or correlations among the constituent elementary particles are the central tasks of all branches of science, from physics, chemistry, to biology. In physics, this ultimate goal has spurred a constant search for high-order correlated entities or composite particles for nearly all states and forms of matter, from elementary particles, nuclei, cold atoms, to condensed matter. So far, such composite particles involving two or three constituent particles have been experimentally identified, such as the Cooper pairs, excitons, and trions in condensed matter physics, or diquarks and mesons in quantum chromodynamics. Although the four-body irreducible entities have long been predicted theoretically in a variety of materials systems alternatively as quadruplons, quadrons, or quartets, the closely related experimental observation so far seems to be restricted to the field of elementary particles (e.g. the recent tetraquark at CERN) only. In this article, we present the first experimental evidence for the existence of a four-body irreducible entity, the quadruplon, involving two electrons and two holes in a monolayer of Molybdenum Ditelluride. Using the optical pump-probe technique, we discovered a series of new spectral features that are distinct from those of trions and bi-excitons. By solving the four-body Bethe-Salpeter equation in conjunction with the cluster expansion approach, we are able to explain these spectral features in terms of the four-body irreducible cluster or the quadruplons. In contrast to a bi-exciton which consists of two weakly bound excitons, a quadruplon consists of two electrons and two holes without the presence of an exciton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are being used to improve the probing of the state spaces of many particle systems as approximations to wavefunctions and in order to avoid the recurring sign problem of quantum monte-carlo. One may ask whether the usual classical neural networks have some actual hidden quantum properties that make them such suitable tools for a highly coupled quantum problem. I discuss here what makes a system quantum and to what extent we can interpret a neural network as having quantum remnants. I suggest that a system can be quantum both due to its fundamental quantum constituents and due to the rules of its functioning, therefore, we can obtain entanglement both due to the quantum constituents' nature and due to the functioning rules, or, in category theory terms, both due to the quantum nature of the objects of a category and of the maps. From a practical point of view, I suggest a possible experiment that could extract entanglement from the quantum functioning rules (maps) of an otherwise classical (from the point of view of the constituents) neural network.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Quantum Effects in Atomistic Spin Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) is a standard tool to model the magnetization dynamics of a variety of materials. The fundamental dynamical model underlying ASD is entirely classical. In this paper, we present two approaches to effectively incorporate quantum effects into ASD simulations, thus enhancing their low temperature predictions. The first allows to simulate the magnetic behavior of a quantum spin system by solving the equations of motion of a classical spin system at an effective temperature relative to the critical temperature. This effective temperature is determined a priori from the microscopic properties of the system. The second approach is based on a \semi model where classical spins interact with an environment with a quantum-like power spectrum. The parameters that characterize this model can be calculated ab initio or extracted from experiments. This semi-classical model quantitatively reproduces the absolute temperature behavior of a magnetic system, thus accounting for the quantum mechanical aspects of its dynamics, even at low temperature. The methods presented here can be readily implemented in current ASD simulations with no additional complexity cost.</description>

      <title>A Realist Interpretation of Unitarity in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15157v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitarity is a difficult concept to implement in canonical quantum gravity because of state non-normalizability and the problem of time. We take a realist approach based on pilot-wave theory to address this issue in the Ashtekar formulation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We use the postulate of a definite configuration in the theory to define a global time for the gravitational-fermionic system recently discussed in (Phys. Rev. D 106.10 (2022): 106012), by parameterizing a variation of a Weyl-spinor that depends on the Kodama state. The total Hamiltonian constraint yields a time-dependent Schrodinger equation, without semi-classical approximations, which we use to derive a local continuity equation over the configuration space. We implement the reality conditions at the level of the guidance equation, and obtain a real spin-connection, extrinsic curvature and triad along the system trajectory. We obtain quantum corrections to deSitter spacetime from the guidance equation. The non-normalizable Kodama state is naturally factored out of the full quantum state in the conserved current density, opening the possibility for quantum-mechanical unitarity. We also give a pilot-wave generalisation of the notion of unitarity applicable to non-normalizable states, and show the existence of equilibrium density for our system. Lastly, we find unitary states in mini-superspace by finding an approximate solution to the Hamiltonian constraint.</description>

Abstract: We establish a density one version of Braak's conjecture on the fine structure of the spectrum of the quantum Rabi model, as well as a recent conjecture of Braak, Nguyen, Reyes-Bustos and Wakayama on the nearest neighbor spacings of the spectrum. The proof uses a three-term asymptotic expansion for large eigenvalues due to Boutet de Monvel and Zielinski, and a number theoretic argument from uniform distribution theory.</description>

Abstract: Recent proposals are emerging for the experimental detection of entanglement mediated by classical gravity, carrying significant theoretical and observational implications. In fact, the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) in LIGO provides an alternative laboratory for testing various gravity-related properties. By employing LIGO's arms as oscillators interacting with gravitational waves (GWs), our study demonstrates the potential for generating quantum entanglement between two mutually orthogonal modes of simple harmonic oscillators. Our findings reveal unique entanglement dynamics, including periodic "collapse and revival" influenced by GW oscillations, alongside a distinct "quantum memory effect." Effectively, each harmonic oscillator feels a temperature. We believe that these forecasts may hold significance towards both theoretically probing and experimentally verifying various properties of classical gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>A Joint Code and Belief Propagation Decoder Design for Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are among the most promising candidates for future quantum error correction schemes. However, a limited number of short to moderate-length QLDPC codes have been designed and their decoding performance is sub-optimal with a quaternary belief propagation (BP) decoder due to unavoidable short cycles in their Tanner graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel joint code and decoder design for QLDPC codes. The constructed codes have a minimum distance of about the square root of the block length. In addition, it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first QLDPC code family where BP decoding is not impaired by short cycles of length 4. This is achieved by using an ensemble BP decoder mitigating the influence of assembled short cycles. We outline two code construction methods based on classical quasi-cyclic codes and finite geometry codes. Numerical results demonstrate outstanding decoding performance over depolarizing channels.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence and dynamics of stable quantized vortices is an important subject of quantum many-body physics. Spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling (SOAMC), a special type of spin-orbit coupling, has been experimentally achieved to create vortices in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). Here, we generalize the concept of SOAMC to a two-component polariton BEC and analyze the emergence and configuration of vortices under a finite-size circular pumping beam. We find that the regular configuration of vortex lattices induced by a finite-size circular pump is significantly distorted by the spatially dependent Raman coupling of SOAMC, even in the presence of a repulsive polariton interaction which can assist the forming of stable vortex configuration. Meanwhile, a pair of vortices induced by SOAMC located at the center of polariton cloud remains stable. When the Raman coupling is sufficiently strong and interaction is weak, the vortices spiraling in from the edge of polariton cloud will disrupt the polariton BEC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state elastic-wave phonons are a promising platform for a wide range of quantum information applications. An outstanding challenge and enabling capability in harnessing phonons for quantum information processing is achieving strong nonlinear interactions between them. To this end, we propose a general architecture using piezoelectric-semiconductor heterostructures consisting of a piezoelectric acoustic material hosting phonon modes in direct proximity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Each phonon in the piezoelectric material carries an electric field, which extends into the 2DEG. The fields induce polarization of 2DEG electrons, which in turn interact with other piezoelectric phononic electric fields. The net result is coupling between the various phonon modes. We derive, from first principles, the nonlinear phononic susceptibility of the system. We show that many nonlinear processes are strongly favored at high electron mobility, motivating the use of the 2DEG to mediate the nonlinearities. We derive in detail the first, second, and third-order susceptibilities and calculate them for the case of a lithium niobate surface acoustic wave interacting with a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure 2DEG. We show that, for this system, the strong third-order nonlinearity could enable single-phonon Kerr shift in an acoustic cavity that exceeds realistic cavity linewidths, potentially leading to a new class of acoustic qubit. We further show that the strong second-order nonlinearity could be used to produce a high-gain, traveling-wave parametric amplifier to amplify--and ultimately detect--the outputs of the acoustic cavity qubits. Assuming favorable losses in such a system, these capabilities, combined with the ability to efficiently transduce phonons from microwave electromagnetic fields in transmission lines, thus hold promise for creating all-acoustic quantum information processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to obtain the full reduced density matrix associated with subregions in quantum Monte Carlo simulations for bosonic and fermionic manybody systems. Our microscopy allows to perform quantum state tomography, and thus gives access to true entanglement measures, such as the logarithmic negativity (LN). We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Our approach allows one to perform quantum state tomography locally in a way that is analogous to atomic-scale imaging with a scanning tunneling microscope. Controlled entanglement microscopy opens a new window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

      <title>Inflationary complexity of thermal state</title>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the inflationary complexity of the two-mode squeezed state with thermal effect for the single field inflation, modified dispersion relation, and non-trivial sound speed with the method of closed system and open system, respectively. Since the various quantum gravitational framework could lead to this kind of modified dispersion relation and non-trivial sound speed, so that our analysis is valid for most inflationary models. $(a)$. The numeric of Krylov complexity in the method of the closed system indicates that the evolution of Krylov complexity highly depends on the squeezed angle parameter once taking the thermal effect into account, which will decay into some very tiny values, but the Krylov complexity will always enhance without thermal effect. $(b)$. The numeric of circuit complexity shows that the evolution is always increasing no matter whether there are thermal effects or not which is independent of the evolution of squeezed angle parameter. $(c)$. By utilizing the method of open system, we first construct the wave function. Our investigations show the evolution of Krylov complexity will enhance upon some peaks factoring in the thermal effects and the Krylov complexity will always increase without thermal effect. $(d)$. We also calculate the Krylov entropy in the method of closed system and open system, which indicates that the hotter the universe is, the more chaotic the universe becomes. Furthermore, our derivation for the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover into the case of closed system under the weak dissipative approximation, which confirms the validity of construction for the wave function. Finally, our numeric of Lanczos coefficient shows that the non-trivial sound speed has minimal chaos compared to the other two cases.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Ambiguity and Potential Exponential Computational Speed-Ups to Solving Dynamic Asset Pricing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate quantum computing solutions to a large class of dynamic nonlinear asset pricing models using algorithms, in theory exponentially more efficient than classical ones, which leverage the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement. The equilibrium asset pricing solution is a quantum state. We introduce quantum decision-theoretic foundations of ambiguity and model/parameter uncertainty to deal with model selection.</description>
