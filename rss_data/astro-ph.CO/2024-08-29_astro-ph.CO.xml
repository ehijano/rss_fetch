      <title>Redshift evolution of the X-ray and UV luminosity relation of quasars: calibrated results from SNe Ia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars could serve as standard candles if the relation between their ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities can be accurately calibrated. Previously, we developed a model-independent method to calibrate quasar standard candles using the distances-redshift relation reconstructed from Type Ia supernova at z&lt;2 using Gaussian process regression. Interestingly, we found that the calibrated quasar standard candle dataset preferred a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM at redshifts above z&gt;2. One interpretation of these findings is that the calibration parameters of the quasar UV-X-ray luminosity relationship evolves with redshift. In order to test the redshift dependence of the quasar calibration in a model-independent manner, we divided the quasar sample whose redshift overlap with the redshift coverage of Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation into two sub-samples: a low-redshift quasar sub-sample and a high-redshift quasar sub-sample. Our present results show that there is about a 4$\sigma$ inconsistency between the quasar parameters inferred from the high-redshift quasar sub-sample and from the low-redshift sub-sample if no evolution of the quasar relation is considered. This inconsistency suggests the necessity of considering redshift evolution for the relationship between the quasars$'$ ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities. We then test an explicit parametrization of the redshift evolution of the quasar calibration parameters via $\gamma(z) = \gamma_0+\gamma_1(1+z)$ and $\beta(z)=\beta_0+\beta_1(1+z)$. Combining this redshift-dependent calibration relationship with the distance-redshift relationship reconstructed from Pantheon+ supernova compilation, we find the high-redshift sub-sample and low-redshift sub-sample become consistent at the 1$\sigma$ level, which means that the parameterized form of $\gamma(z)$ and $\beta(z)$ works well at describing the evolution of the quasar calibration parameters.</description>

      <title>Measuring $\sigma_8$ using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Emission-Line Galaxies and Planck CMB Lensing and the Impact of Dust on Parameter Inferenc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the growth of structure is a powerful probe for studying the dark sector, especially in light of the $\sigma_8$ tension between primary CMB anisotropy and low-redshift surveys. This paper provides a new measurement of the amplitude of the matter power spectrum, $\sigma_8$, using galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-CMB lensing power spectra of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys Emission-Line Galaxies and the $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 CMB lensing map. We create an ELG catalog composed of $27$ million galaxies and with a purity of $85\%$, covering a redshift range $0 &lt; z &lt; 3$, with $z_{\rm mean} = 1.09$. We implement several novel systematic corrections, such as jointly modeling the contribution of imaging systematics and photometric redshift uncertainties to the covariance matrix. We also study the impacts of various dust maps on cosmological parameter inference. We measure the cross-power spectra over $f_{\rm sky} = 0.25$ with a signal-to-background ratio of up to $ 30\sigma$. We find that the choice of dust maps to account for imaging systematics in estimating the ELG overdensity field has a significant impact on the final estimated values of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm M}$, with far-infrared emission-based dust maps preferring $\sigma_8$ to be as low as $0.702 \pm 0.030$, and stellar-reddening-based dust maps preferring as high as $0.719 \pm 0.030$. The highest preferred value is at $\sim 3 \sigma$ tension with the $\textit{Planck}$ primary anisotropy results. These findings indicate a need for tomographic analyses at high redshifts and joint modeling of systematics.</description>

      <title>Halo bias in the peak model. A first-principles non-parametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Press-Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) models of structure formation fail in reproducing the halo bias found in simulations, while the excursion set-peaks (ESP) formalism built in the peak model reproduces it only at high masses and does not address in a fully satisfactory manner peak nesting and the mass and time of ellipsoidal collapse of triaxial peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed density field. Here we apply the CUSP formalism fixing all these issues from first principles and with no free parameters to infer the Lagrangian local peak bias parameters, which adopt very simple analytic expressions similar to those found in the PS and ES models. The predicted Eulerian linear halo bias recovers the results of simulations. More specifically, we show that the only small departure observed at intermediate and low masses can be due to the spurious halo splitting and grouping caused by the Spherical Overdensity halo-finding algorithm used in simulations.</description>

      <title>Origin and full characterization of the secondary (assembly) halo bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Not only are halos of different masses differently clustered, the so-called primary bias, but halos with distinct internal properties also are, which is known as secondary bias. Contrarily to the former bias, the latter is not understood within the Press-Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) formalisms of structure formation, where protohalos are fully characterised by their height and scale. As halos in different backgrounds undergo mergers at different rates, the secondary bias was suggested not to be innate but to arise from the distinct assembly history of halos. However, it has recently been proven that mergers leave no imprint in halo properties. But, in the peak model of structure formation, the secondary bias could still be innate and arise from the different typical curvature of peaks lying in different backgrounds. Here we show that this is the case, indeed. Using the CUSP formalism, we find that peaks lying in different backgrounds with different typical curvatures evolve in halos with different density profiles which in turn lead to many other distinct properties. The dependence we find of halo bias with those properties reproduces the results of simulations.</description>

      <title>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited. I. Protohalo Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Tidal Torque Theory (TTT), the angular momentum of haloes arises from the tidal torque produced on protohaloes by the mass fluctuations around them. That approach, initially developed assuming protohaloes as random overdense regions in the linear density field, was extended to the more realistic scenario that protohaloes are collapsing patches around peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed linear density field. But that extension faced two fundamental issues: 1) the unknown mass of collapsing patches marked by Gaussian peaks, and 2) the unknown ellipsoidal collapse time of those triaxial patches. Furthermore, the TTT strictly holds in linear regime only. This Paper is the first of a series of two devoted to revisiting the TTT and accurately calculating the halo angular momentum. In the present Paper we use the CUSP formalism fixing all those issues to deal with the TTT from a full peak model viewpoint, i.e. not only is the protohalo suffering the tidal torque identified to a peak, but the main mass fluctuation causing the tidal torque is also seen as a peak or a hole. This way we obtain a simple analytic expression for the Lagrangian protohalo AM, which can be readily implemented in galaxy formation models and be compared to the results of simulations.</description>

      <title>Traces of Quantum Gravity Effects at Late time Cosmological Dynamics via Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the entropy-area relation of black hole thermodynamics, we study the thermodynamics of cosmological apparent horizon in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe in the framework of an Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). The adopted EUP naturally admits a minimal measurable momentum (equivalently a maximal measurable length), as an infrared cutoff in the theory. We derive the modified Friedmann equations in this setup and explore some predictions of these equations for the late time universe via distance measures. We show that in this framework it is possible to realize the late time cosmic speed-up and transition to the phantom phase of the equation of state parameter of the effective cosmic fluid without recourse to any dark energy component or modified gravity. Inspection of various distance measures in this framework shows that an EUP with a negative deformation parameter suffices for the interpretation of the late time asymptotically de Sitter universe with standard non-relativistic matter.</description>

      <title>Narrow line AGN selection in CEERS: spectroscopic selection, physical properties, X-ray and radio analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) among the $\sim 300$ publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the CEERS Survey. Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGN at $2\lesssim z\lesssim 9$ on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified 4 new $z\lesssim 2$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN), in addition to the 8 previously reported high-$z$ BLAGN. We found that the traditional BPT diagnostic diagrams are not suited to identify high-$z$ AGN, while most of the high-$z$ NLAGN are selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]$\lambda$4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration of the sample of NLAGN with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGN heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies' physical properties, as further confirmed by SED-fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-$z$ NLAGNs selected in this work are well below those sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGN. Finally, we investigate the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGN and of the sample of high-$z$ BLAGN. We find that all but 4 NLAGN are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-$z$ BLAGN. We do not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of $\sim 1-2$ dex from what is expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection leaving open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.</description>

      <title>Standard siren cosmology in the era of the 2.5-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors: bright and dark sirens of LIGO Voyager and NEMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2.5-generation (2.5G) ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors LIGO Voyager and NEMO are expected to be operational in the late 2020s and early 2030s. In this work, we explore the potential of GW standard sirens observed by the 2.5G GW detectors in measuring cosmological parameters, especially for the Hubble constant. Using GWs to measure cosmological parameters is inherently challenging, especially for 2.5G detectors, given their limited capability, which results in weaker constraints on cosmological parameters from the detected standard sirens. However, the measurement of the Hubble constant using standard siren observations from Voyager and NEMO is still promising. For example, using bright sirens from Voyager and NEMO can measure the Hubble constant with a precision of about $2\%$ and $6\%$ respectively, and using the Voyager-NEMO network can improve the precision to about $1.6\%$. Moreover, bright sirens can be used to break the degeneracy of cosmological parameters generated by CMB data, and to a certain extent, 2.5G detectors can also play a role in this aspect. Observations of dark sirens by 2.5G detectors can achieve relatively good results in measuring the Hubble constant, with a precision of within $2\%$, and if combining observations of bright and dark sirens, the precision of the Hubble constant measurement can reach about $1.4\%$. Finally, we also discussed the impact of the uncertainty in the binary neutron star merger rate on the estimation of cosmological parameters. We conclude that the magnificent prospect for solving the Hubble tension is worth expecting in the era of the 2.5G ground-based GW detectors.</description>

      <title>EFTofLSS meets simulation-based inference: $\sigma_8$ from biased tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological inferences typically rely on explicit expressions for the likelihood and covariance of the data vector, which normally consists of a set of summary statistics. However, in the case of nonlinear large-scale structure, exact expressions for either likelihood or covariance are unknown, and even approximate expressions can become very cumbersome, depending on the scales and summary statistics considered. Simulation-based inference (SBI), in contrast, does not require an explicit form for the likelihood but only a prior and a simulator, thereby naturally circumventing these issues. In this paper, we explore how this technique can be used to infer $\sigma_8$ from a Lagrangian effective field theory (EFT) based forward model for biased tracers. The power spectrum and bispectrum are used as summary statistics to obtain the posterior of the cosmological, bias and noise parameters via neural density estimation. We compare full simulation-based inference with cases where the data vector is drawn from a Gaussian likelihood with sample and analytical covariances. We conclude that, for $k_{\text{max}}=0.1h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $0.2h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, the form of the covariance is more important than the non-Gaussianity of the likelihood, although this conclusion is expected to depend on the cosmological parameter inferred, the summary statistics considered and range of scales probed.</description>

      <title>asimulation: Domain formation and impact on observables in resolved cosmological simulations of the (a)symmetron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetron is a dark energy and dark matter candidate that forms topological defects in the late-time universe and holds the promise of resolving some of the cosmological tensions. We performed high-resolution simulations of the dynamical and non-linear (a)symmetron using the recently developed relativistic N-body code asevolution. By extensively testing the temporal and spatial convergence of domain decompositioning and domain wall stability, we determined criteria and physical intuition for the convergence. We applied the resolution criteria to run five high-resolution simulations with 1280^3 grids and a box size of 500 Mpc/h of the (a)symmetron. We considered the behaviour of the scalar field and the domain walls in each scenario. We find the effect on the matter power spectra, the HMFs, and observables computed over the past light cone of an observer, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and non-linear Rees-Sciama effect and the lensing, compared to LCDM. We show local oscillations of the fifth force strength and the formation of planar structures in the density field. The dynamics of the field was visualised in animations with high resolution in time. The simulation code is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Clustering of primordial black holes from quantum diffusion during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how large fluctuations are spatially correlated in the presence of quantum diffusion during inflation. This is done by computing real-space correlation functions in the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. We first derive an exact description of physical distances as measured by a local observer at the end of inflation, improving on previous works. Our approach is based on recursive algorithmic methods that consistently include volume-weighting effects. We then propose a "large-volume'' approximation under which calculations can be done using first-passage time analysis only, and from which a new formula for the power spectrum in stochastic inflation is derived. We then study the full two-point statistics of the curvature perturbation. Due to the presence of exponential tails, we find that the joint distribution of large fluctuations is of the form $P(\zeta_{R_1}, \zeta_{R_2}) = F(R_1,R_2,r) P(\zeta_{R_1})P( \zeta_{R_2})$, where $\zeta_{R_1}$ and $\zeta_{R_2}$ denote the curvature perturbation coarse-grained at radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, around two spatial points distant by $r$. This implies that, on the tail, the reduced correlation function, defined as $P(\zeta_{R_1}&gt;\zeta_{\rm{c}}, \zeta_{R_2}&gt;\zeta_{\rm{c}})/[P(\zeta_{R_1}&gt;\zeta_{\rm{c}}) P(\zeta_{R_2}&gt;\zeta_{\rm{c}})]-1$, is independent of the threshold value $\zeta_{\rm{c}}$. This contrasts with Gaussian statistics where the same quantity strongly decays with $\zeta_{\rm{c}}$, and shows the existence of a universal clustering profile for all structures forming in the exponential tails. Structures forming in the intermediate (i.e. not yet exponential) tails may feature different, model-dependent behaviours.</description>

      <title>Evidence for axion miniclusters with an increased central density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify axion miniclusters collapsing in the radiation-dominated era and follow them to redshift $z=99$ with N-body simulations. We find that the majority of the densest miniclusters end up in the center of larger minicluster halos at late times. Soon after their formation, the miniclusters exhibit NFW profiles but they subsequently develop a steeper inner slope approaching $\rho\sim r^{-2}$ on small scales. Using the so far most highly resolved axion structure formation simulation with $2048^3$ particles we examine the structure of previously studied minicluster halos. While the density profiles of their subhalos are NFW-like we confirm that a modified NFW profile with a steeper inner slope provides a better description for minicluster halos with masses above $\sim 10^{-12}\,M_\odot$. We show that miniclusters with a higher central density might be in contrast to pure NFW halos dense enough to induce gravitational microlensing. Likewise, more compact minicluster halos will have immediate implications for direct and indirect axion detection.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations from inflation in the presence of gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how Abelian-gauge-field production during inflation affects scalar perturbations in the case when the gauge field interacts with the inflaton directly (by means of generic kinetic and axial couplings) and via gravity. The homogeneous background solution is defined by self-consistently taking into account the backreaction of the gauge field on the evolution of the inflaton and the scale factor. For the perturbations on top of this background, all possible scalar contributions coming from the inflaton, the metric, and the gauge field are considered. We derive a second-order differential equation for the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, capturing the impact of the gauge field, both on the background dynamics and on the evolution of scalar perturbations. The latter is described by a source term in the $\zeta$ equation, which is quadratic in the gauge-field operators and leads to non-Gaussianities in the curvature perturbations. We derive general expressions for the induced scalar power spectrum and bispectrum. Finally, we apply our formalism to the well-known case of axion inflation without backreaction. Numerical results show that, in this example, the effect of including metric perturbations is small for values of the gauge-field production parameter $\xi&gt; 3$. This is in agreement with the previous results in the literature. However, in the region of smaller values, $\xi\lesssim 2$, our new results exhibit order-of-unity deviations when compared to previous results.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-limit photon mean free path at the end of late reionisation in the Sherwood-Relics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent evidence supporting reionisation ending at redshift z&lt;6 includes the rapid redshift evolution of the mean free path for Lyman-limit photons through the intergalactic medium at 5&lt;z&lt;6. Here we investigate the mean free path predicted by the Sherwood-Relics suite of hybrid radiation hydrodynamical simulations. Simulations with comoving volumes of 40^3 h^-3 cMpc^3 (160^3 h^-3 cMpc^3), calibrated to match the observed Lyman-alpha forest transmission with a late end to reionisation at z&lt;6, are consistent with recent mean free path measurements at z&lt;5.9, and are 1.2\sigma (1.8\sigma) above the highest redshift mean free path measurement at z=5.93. The majority of the Lyman-limit opacity at the end of reionisation is attributable to highly ionised Lyman-alpha forest absorbers with neutral hydrogen column densities N_HI=10^16--10^17 cm^-2. Resolving these systems is critical for capturing the redshift evolution of the mean free path during the final stages of reionisation. After reionisation completes, overdense gas will reduce the mean free path by up to 20 per cent around haloes with masses M_h ~ 10^9--10^11 h^-1 M_sol, but during reionisation ionised bubbles will instead boost the mean free path around haloes by up to an order of magnitude when the IGM is as much as 90 per cent neutral by volume. This effect will play an important role in the visibility of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies at z&gt;10 discovered with JWST.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of inflationary dynamics: slow roll and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of the inflationary dynamics are presented here for a single canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. We spell out the basic equations governing the inflationary dynamics in terms of cosmic time $t$ and define a set of dimensionless variables convenient for numerical analysis. We then provide a link to our simple numerical Python code on GitHub that can be used to simulate the background dynamics as well as the evolution of linear perturbations during inflation. The code computes both scalar and tensor power spectra for a given inflaton potential $V(\phi)$. We discuss a concrete algorithm to use the code for various purposes, especially for computing the enhanced scalar power spectrum in the context of Primordial Black Holes and scalar-induced Gravitational Waves. We also compare the efficiency of different variables used in the literature to compute the scalar fluctuations. We intend to extend the framework to simulate the dynamics of a number of different quantities, including the computation of scalar-induced second-order tensor power spectrum in the near future.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter with explicit Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking in the axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was shown that the required high quality of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry can be a natural outcome of the multiple QCD axions model. In the axiverse, a hypothetical mass mixing between the QCD axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) can occur, which leads to an interesting phenomenon called the level crossing. In this paper, we investigate this mass mixing between one QCD axion and one ALP with the explicit PQ symmetry breaking in the early Universe. The dynamics of the axions and their cosmological evolutions when the level crossing occurs in this scenario are studied in detail. We show the evolution of the mass eigenvalues and the mass mixing angle. Then we check the condition for energy adiabatic transition with the corresponding parameter set. Finally, we estimate the relic density of the QCD axion and ALP dark matter through the misalignment mechanism. We find that, the QCD axion relic density can be suppressed, while the ALP relic density can be enhanced. The level crossing in our scenario may have some cosmological implications, such as the axion domain walls formation, the nano-Hertz gravitational waves emission, and also the primordial black holes formation.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE III: The IMF in Quasar Accretion Disks from STARFORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations, including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches) in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then dynamically decouple from the gas and wander, ceasing accretion on timescales ~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are swept up into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as the global dynamical times can become incredibly short ($\ll$ yr) and tidal fields are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular momentum or fragment catastrophically at $\lesssim 10$ au scales requires novel PSD simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs, though we discuss a couple of viable models.</description>

      <title>Critical Analysis of Replacing Dark Matter and Dark Energy with a Model of Stochastic Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze consequences of trying to replace dark matter and dark energy with models of stochastic spacetime. In particular, we analyze the model put forth by Ref. [1], in which it is claimed that ``post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has four basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics, (iii) the spectrum of fluctuations is very different from observations, and (iv) we also identify some theoretical problems in these models.</description>

      <title>Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model and gravitational waves from domain walls bounded by strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry via an intermediate discrete symmetry may yield a hybrid topological defect of \emph{domain walls bounded by cosmic strings}. The decay of this defect network leads to a unique gravitational wave signal spanning many orders in observable frequencies, that can be distinguished from signals generated by other sources. We investigate the production of gravitational waves from this mechanism in the context of the type-I two-Higgs-doublet model extended by a $U(1)_R$ symmetry, that simultaneously accommodates the seesaw mechanism, anomaly cancellation, and eliminates flavour-changing neutral currents. The gravitational wave spectrum produced by the string-bounded-wall network can be detected for $U(1)_R$ breaking scale from $10^{12}$ to $10^{15}$ GeV in forthcoming interferometers including LISA and Einstein Telescope, with a distinctive $f^{3}$ slope and inflexion in the frequency range between microhertz and hertz.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dark Cosmology: From Early Matter Dominance to Delayed Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel mechanism for producing dark compact objects and black holes through a dark sector, where all the dark matter can be dissipative. Heavy dark sector particles with masses above $10^4$ GeV can come to dominate the Universe and yield an early matter-dominated era before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Density perturbations in this epoch can grow and collapse into tiny dark matter halos, which cool via self interactions. The typical halo size is set by the Hubble length once perturbations begin growing, offering a straightforward prediction of the halo size and evolution depending on ones choice of dark matter model. Once these primordial halos have formed, a thermal phase transition can then shift the Universe back into radiation domination and standard cosmology. These halos can continue to collapse after BBN, resulting in the late-time formation of fragmented dark compact objects and sub-solar mass primordial black holes. We find that these compact objects can constitute a sizable fraction of all of dark matter. The resulting fragments can have masses between $10^{20}$ g to $10^{32}$ g, with radii ranging from $10^{-2}$ m to $10^5$ m, while the black holes can have masses between $10^{8}$ g to $10^{34}$ g. Furthermore, a unique feature of this model is the late-time formation of black holes which can evaporate today. We compare where these objects lie with respect to current primordial black hole and and massive (astrophysical) compact halo object constraints.</description>

      <title>In-in formalism for the entropy of quantum fields in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to compute the purity and entanglement entropy for quantum fields in a systematic perturbative expansion. To that end, we generalize the in-in formalism to non-unitary dynamics (i.e. accounting for the presence of an environment) and to the calculation of quantum information measures, which are not observables in the usual sense. This allows us to reduce the problem to one involving standard correlation functions, and to organize their computation in a diagrammatic expansion for which we construct the corresponding Feynman rules. As an illustration, we apply the formalism to a cosmological setting inspired by the effective field theory of inflation. We find that at late times, non-linear loop corrections share the same time behavior as the linear contribution, and only yield a slight redressing of the purity. In particular, when the environment is heavy compared to the Hubble scale, the phenomenon of recoherence previously encountered is robust to the class of non-linear extensions considered. Bridging the gap between perturbative quantum field theory and open quantum systems paves the way to a better understanding of renormalization and resummation in open effective field theories. It also enables a more systematic exploration of quantum information properties in field theoretic settings.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on fluid dynamics in cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) sources the stochastic gravitational wave background (SWGB) through bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. So far, most studies on the fluid profile of an expanding bubble are limited to transitions that complete in a much shorter time scale than the cosmic expansion. In this study, we investigate gravitational effects on the fluid profile beyond the self-similar regime. For this purpose we combine a hydrodynamic scheme in the presence of gravity with a fluid computation scheme under energy injection from the bubble wall. By performing (1+1)d simulations of spherical bubble for constant wall velocities, we find that the fluid generally develops a thinner shell in our cosmological setup, which qualitatively agrees with previous studies discussing the late-time behavior of fluid in expanding spacetime. We also observe reduction in the energy budget for the fluid kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find that the fluid profile develops sub-structure for accelerating bubble walls. We also comment on the possible broadening of the SGWB spectral plateau.</description>
