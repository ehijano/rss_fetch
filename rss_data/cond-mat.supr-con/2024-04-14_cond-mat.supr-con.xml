      <title>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from first principles quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong-light matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. The results highlight that strong-light matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconducting diode effects via antisymmetry and antisymmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking plays a pivotal role in unlocking intriguing properties and functionalities in material systems. For example, the breaking of spatial and temporal symmetries leads to a fascinating phenomenon of superconducting diode effect. However, generating and precisely controlling the superconducting diode effect poses significant challenges. Here, we take a novel route with deliberate manipulation of magnetic charge potentials to realize unconventional superconducting flux-quantum diode effects. We achieve this through suitably tailored nanoengineered arrays of nanobar magnets on top of a superconducting thin film. We demonstrate the vital roles of inversion antisymmetry and its breaking in evoking unconventional superconducting effects-a magnetically symmetric diode effect and an odd-parity magnetotransport effect. These effects are non-volatilely controllable through in-situ magnetization switching of the nanobar magnets. Our findings promote the use of antisymmetry (breaking) for initiating unconventional superconducting properties, paving the way for exciting prospects and innovative functionalities in superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Spin-resolved nonlocal transport in proximitized Rashba nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium transport in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanowires is crucial for many quantum phenomena such as generating entangled states via cross Andreev reflection (CAR) processes, detecting topological superconductivity, reading out Andreev spin qubits, coupling spin qubits over long distances and so on. Here, we investigate numerically transport properties of a proximitized Rashba nanowire that hosts spin-polarized low-energy quasiparticle states. We show that the spin polarization in such one-dimensional Andreev bands, extended over the entire nanowire length, can be detected in nonlocal transport measurements with tunnel-coupled side leads that are spin polarized. Remarkably, we find an exact correspondence between the sign of the nonlocal conductance and the spin density of the superconducting quasiparticles at the side lead position. We demonstrate that this feature is robust to moderate static disorder. As an example, we show that such a method can be used to detect spin inversion of the bands, accompanying the topological phase transition (TPT) for realistic system parameters. Furthermore, we show that such effects can be used to switch between CAR and elastic cotunneling (ECT) processes by tuning the strength of either the electric or the magnetic field. These findings hold significant practical implications for state-of-the-art transport experiments in such hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Rotation of gap nodes in the topological superconductor Cu$_x$(PbSe)$_5$(Bi$_2$Se$_3$)$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the family of odd-parity topological superconductors derived from $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$, $\mathrm{Cu}_{x}(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ (CPSBS) has been elucidated to have gap nodes. Although the nodal gap structure has been established by specific-heat and thermal-conductivity measurements, there has been no direct observation of the superconducting gap of CPSBS using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS). Here we report the first STS experiments on CPSBS down to 0.35 K, which found that the vortices generated by out-of-plane magnetic fields have an elliptical shape, reflecting the anisotropic gap structure. The orientation of the gap minima is found to be aligned with the bulk direction when the surface lattice image shows twofold symmetry, but, surprisingly, it is rotated by 30$^{\circ}$ when twofold symmetry is absent. In addition, the superconducting gap spectra in zero magnetic field suggest that the gap nodes are most likely lifted. We argue that only an emergent symmetry at the surface, allowing for a linear superposition of gap functions with different symmetries in the bulk, can lead to the rotation of the gap nodes. The absence of inversion symmetry at the surface additionally lifts the nodes. This result establishes the subtle but crucial role of crystalline symmetry in topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Structural routes to stabilise superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bilayer perovskite La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has recently been found to enter a superconducting state under hydrostatic pressure at temperatures as high as 80 K. The onset of superconductivity is observed concurrent with a structural transition which suggests that superconductivity is inherently related to this specific structure. Here we perform density functional theory based structural relaxation calculations and identify several promising routes to stabilize the crystal structure which hosts the superconducting state at ambient pressure. We find that the structural transition is controlled almost entirely by a reduction of the b-axis lattice constant, which suggests that uniaxial compression along the [010] direction or in-plane biaxial compression are sufficient as tuning parameters to control this transition. Furthermore, we show that increasing the size of the A-site cations can also induce the structural transitions via chemical pressure and identify Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and Ba-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as potential candidates for a high temperature superconducting nickelate at ambient pressure.</description>
