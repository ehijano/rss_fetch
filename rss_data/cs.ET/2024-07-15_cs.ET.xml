      <title>A Quantum Computing Approach for Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the multi-vehicle Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem, crucial for applications like search and rescue or environmental monitoring. Due to its NP-hard nature, finding optimal solutions becomes infeasible with larger problem sizes. This motivates the development of heuristic approaches that enhance efficiency even marginally. We propose a novel approach for exploring paths in a 2D grid, specifically designed for easy integration with the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA), a powerful quantum heuristic. Our contribution includes: 1) An objective function tailored to solve the multi-vehicle CPP using QAOA. 2) Theoretical proofs guaranteeing the validity of the proposed approach. 3) Efficient construction of QAOA operators for practical implementation. 4) Resource estimation to assess the feasibility of QAOA execution. 5) Performance comparison against established algorithms like the Depth First Search. This work paves the way for leveraging quantum computing in optimizing multi-vehicle path planning, potentially leading to real-world advancements in various applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid pace of development in quantum computing technology has sparked a proliferation of benchmarks for assessing the performance of quantum computing hardware and software. Good benchmarks empower scientists, engineers, programmers, and users to understand a computing system's power, but bad benchmarks can misdirect research and inhibit progress. In this Perspective, we survey the science of quantum computer benchmarking. We discuss the role of benchmarks and benchmarking, and how good benchmarks can drive and measure progress towards the long-term goal of useful quantum computations, i.e., "quantum utility". We explain how different kinds of benchmark quantify the performance of different parts of a quantum computer, we survey existing benchmarks, critically discuss recent trends in benchmarking, and highlight important open research questions in this field.</description>

      <title>What Do People Think about Sentient AI?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08867v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With rapid advances in machine learning, many people in the field have been discussing the rise of digital minds and the possibility of artificial sentience. Future developments in AI capabilities and safety will depend on public opinion and human-AI interaction. To begin to fill this research gap, we present the first nationally representative survey data on the topic of sentient AI: initial results from the Artificial Intelligence, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) survey, a preregistered and longitudinal study of U.S. public opinion that began in 2021. Across one wave of data collection in 2021 and two in 2023 (total N = 3,500), we found mind perception and moral concern for AI well-being in 2021 were higher than predicted and significantly increased in 2023: for example, 71% agree sentient AI deserve to be treated with respect, and 38% support legal rights. People have become more threatened by AI, and there is widespread opposition to new technologies: 63% support a ban on smarter-than-human AI, and 69% support a ban on sentient AI. Expected timelines are surprisingly short and shortening with a median forecast of sentient AI in only five years and artificial general intelligence in only two years. We argue that, whether or not AIs become sentient, the discussion itself may overhaul human-computer interaction and shape the future trajectory of AI technologies, including existential risks and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Redefinition of Digital Twin and its Situation Awareness Framework Designing Towards Fourth Paradigm for Energy Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional knowledge-based situation awareness (SA) modes struggle to adapt to the escalating complexity of today's Energy Internet of Things (EIoT), necessitating a pivotal paradigm shift. In response, this work introduces a pioneering data-driven SA framework, termed digital twin-based situation awareness (DT-SA), aiming to bridge existing gaps between data and demands, and further to enhance SA capabilities within the complex EIoT landscape. First, we redefine the concept of digital twin (DT) within the EIoT context, aligning it with data-intensive scientific discovery paradigm (the Fourth Paradigm) so as to waken EIoT's sleeping data; this contextual redefinition lays the cornerstone of our DT-SA framework for EIoT. Then, the framework is comprehensively explored through its four fundamental steps: digitalization, simulation, informatization, and intellectualization. These steps initiate a virtual ecosystem conducive to a continuously self-adaptive, self-learning, and self-evolving big model (BM), further contributing to the evolution and effectiveness of DT-SA in engineering. Our framework is characterized by the incorporation of system theory and Fourth Paradigm as guiding ideologies, DT as data engine, and BM as intelligence engine. This unique combination forms the backbone of our approach. This work extends beyond engineering, stepping into the domain of data science -- DT-SA not only enhances management practices for EIoT users/operators, but also propels advancements in pattern analysis and machine intelligence (PAMI) within the intricate fabric of a complex system. Numerous real-world cases validate our DT-SA framework.</description>

      <title>Resource-aware scheduling of multiple quantum circuits on a hardware device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent quantum technologies and quantum error-correcting codes emphasize the requirement for arranging interacting qubits in a nearest-neighbor (NN) configuration while mapping a quantum circuit onto a given hardware device, in order to avoid undesirable noise. It is equally important to minimize the wastage of qubits in a quantum hardware device with m qubits while running circuits of n qubits in total, with n &lt; m. In order to prevent cross-talk between two circuits, a buffer distance between their layouts is needed. Furthermore, not all the qubits and all the two-qubit interactions are at the same noise-level. Scheduling multiple circuits on the same hardware may create a possibility that some circuits are executed on a noisier layout than the others. In this paper, we consider an optimization problem which schedules as many circuits as possible for execution in parallel on the hardware, while maintaining a pre-defined layout quality for each. An integer linear programming formulation to ensure maximum fidelity while preserving the nearest neighbor arrangement among interacting qubits is presented. Our assertion is supported by comprehensive investigations involving various well-known quantum circuit benchmarks. As this scheduling problem is shown to be NP Hard, we also propose a greedy heuristic method which provides 2x and 3x better utilization for 27-qubit and 127-qubit hardware devices respectively in terms of qubits and time.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Temporal Computing for Lower Power Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new hybrid temporal computing (HTC) framework that leverages both pulse rate and temporal data encoding to design ultra-low energy hardware accelerators. Our approach is inspired by the recently proposed temporal computing, or race logic, which encodes data values as single delays, leading to significantly lower energy consumption due to minimized signal switching. However, race logic is limited in its applications due to inherent restrictions. The new HTC framework overcomes these limitations by encoding signals in both temporal and pulse rate formats for multiplication and in temporal format for propagation. This approach maintains reduced switch energy while being general enough to implement a wide range of arithmetic operations. We demonstrate how HTC multiplication is performed for both unipolar and bipolar data encoding and present the basic designs for multipliers, adders, and MAC units. Additionally, we implement two hardware accelerators: a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)/iDCT engine for image compression and DSP applications. Experimental results show that the HTC MAC has a significantly smaller power and area footprint compared to the Unary MAC design and is orders of magnitude faster. Compared to the CBSC MAC, the HTC MAC reduces power consumption by $45.2\%$ and area footprint by $50.13\%$. For the FIR design, the HTC design significantly outperforms the Unary design on all metrics. Compared to the CBSC design, the HTC-based FIR filter reduces power consumption by $36.61\%$ and area cost by $45.85\%$. The HTC-based DCT filter retains the quality of the original image with a decent PSNR, while consuming $23.34\%$ less power and occupying $18.20\%$ less area than the CBSC MAC-based DCT filter.</description>

      <title>Dynamic neural network with memristive CIM and CAM for 2D and 3D vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain is dynamic, associative and efficient. It reconfigures by associating the inputs with past experiences, with fused memory and processing. In contrast, AI models are static, unable to associate inputs with past experiences, and run on digital computers with physically separated memory and processing. We propose a hardware-software co-design, a semantic memory-based dynamic neural network (DNN) using memristor. The network associates incoming data with the past experience stored as semantic vectors. The network and the semantic memory are physically implemented on noise-robust ternary memristor-based Computing-In-Memory (CIM) and Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) circuits, respectively. We validate our co-designs, using a 40nm memristor macro, on ResNet and PointNet++ for classifying images and 3D points from the MNIST and ModelNet datasets, which not only achieves accuracy on par with software but also a 48.1% and 15.9% reduction in computational budget. Moreover, it delivers a 77.6% and 93.3% reduction in energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Encoding arbitrary Ising Hamiltonians on Spatial Photonic Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic Ising Machines constitute an emergent new paradigm of computation, geared towards tackling combinatorial optimization problems that can be reduced to the problem of finding the ground state of an Ising model. Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Indoor Localization Approach Using WiFi RSSI Fingerprinting with SLAM-Enabled Robotic Platform and Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization plays a vital role in the era of the IoT and robotics, with WiFi technology being a prominent choice due to its ubiquity. We present a method for creating WiFi fingerprinting datasets to enhance indoor localization systems and address the gap in WiFi fingerprinting dataset creation. We used the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm and employed a robotic platform to construct precise maps and localize robots in indoor environments. We developed software applications to facilitate data acquisition, fingerprinting dataset collection, and accurate ground truth map building. Subsequently, we aligned the spatial information generated via the SLAM with the WiFi scans to create a comprehensive WiFi fingerprinting dataset. The created dataset was used to train a deep neural network (DNN) for indoor localization, which can prove the usefulness of grid density. We conducted experimental validation within our office environment to demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, including a heatmap from the dataset showcasing the spatial distribution of WiFi signal strengths for the testing access points placed within the environment. Notably, our method offers distinct advantages over existing approaches as it eliminates the need for a predefined map of the environment, requires no preparatory steps, lessens human intervention, creates a denser fingerprinting dataset, and reduces the WiFi fingerprinting dataset creation time. Our method achieves 26% more accurate localization than the other methods and can create a six times denser fingerprinting dataset in one-third of the time compared to the traditional method. In summary, using WiFi RSSI Fingerprinting data surveyed by the SLAM-Enabled Robotic Platform, we can adapt our trained DNN model to indoor localization in any dynamic environment and enhance its scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A digital-analog quantum genetic algorithm using Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) combines digital gates with analog operations, offering an alternative paradigm for universal quantum computation. This approach leverages the higher fidelities of analog operations and the flexibility of local single-qubit gates. In this work, we propose a quantum genetic algorithm within the DAQC framework using a Rydberg atom emulator. The algorithm employs single-qubit operations in the digital domain and a global driving interaction based on the Rydberg Hamiltonian in the analog domain. We evaluate the algorithm performance by estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians, with a focus on molecules such as $\rm H_2$, $\rm LiH$ and $\rm BeH_2$. Our results show energy estimations with less than 1% error and state overlaps nearing 1, with computation times ranging from a few minutes for $\rm H_2$ (2-qubit circuits) to one to two days for $\rm LiH$ and $\rm BeH_2$ (6-qubit circuits). The gate fidelities of global analog operations further underscore DAQC as a promising quantum computing strategy in the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent decades, the demand for computational power has surged, particularly with the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). As we navigate the post-Moore's law era, the limitations of traditional electrical digital computing, including process bottlenecks and power consumption issues, are propelling the search for alternative computing paradigms. Among various emerging technologies, integrated photonics stands out as a promising solution for next-generation high-performance computing, thanks to the inherent advantages of light, such as low latency, high bandwidth, and unique multiplexing techniques. Furthermore, the progress in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which are equipped with abundant photoelectronic components, positions photonic-electronic integrated circuits as a viable solution for high-performance computing and hardware AI accelerators. In this review, we survey recent advancements in both PIC-based digital and analog computing for AI, exploring the principal benefits and obstacles of implementation. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive analysis of photonic AI from the perspectives of hardware implementation, accelerator architecture, and software-hardware co-design. In the end, acknowledging the existing challenges, we underscore potential strategies for overcoming these issues and offer insights into the future drivers for optical computing.</description>

Abstract: The escalating challenge of misinformation, particularly in political discourse, requires advanced fact-checking solutions; this is even clearer in the more complex scenario of multimodal claims. We tackle this issue using a multimodal large language model in conjunction with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and introduce two novel reasoning techniques: Chain of RAG (CoRAG) and Tree of RAG (ToRAG). They fact-check multimodal claims by extracting both textual and image content, retrieving external information, and reasoning subsequent questions to be answered based on prior evidence. We achieve a weighted F1-score of 0.85, surpassing a baseline reasoning technique by 0.14 points. Human evaluation confirms that the vast majority of our generated fact-check explanations contain all information from gold standard data.</description>

      <title>Traffic signal optimization in large-scale urban road networks: an adaptive-predictive controller using Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing smooth traffic flow is important for achieving carbon neutrality. Adaptive traffic signal control, which considers traffic conditions, has thus attracted attention. However, it is difficult to ensure optimal vehicle flow throughout a large city using existing control methods because of their heavy computational load. Here, we propose a control method called AMPIC (Adaptive Model Predictive Ising Controller) that guarantees both scalability and optimality. The proposed method employs model predictive control to solve an optimal control problem at each control interval with explicit consideration of a predictive model of vehicle flow. This optimal control problem is transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem with binary variables that is equivalent to the so-called Ising problem. This transformation allows us to use an Ising solver, which has been widely studied and is expected to have fast and efficient optimization performance. We performed numerical experiments using a microscopic traffic simulator for a realistic city road network. The results show that AMPIC enables faster vehicle cruising speed with less waiting time than that achieved by classical control methods, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. The model predictive approach with a long prediction horizon thus effectively improves control performance. Systematic parametric studies on model cities indicate that the proposed method realizes smoother traffic flows for large city road networks. Among Ising solvers, D-Wave's quantum annealing is shown to find near-optimal solutions at a reasonable computational cost.</description>
