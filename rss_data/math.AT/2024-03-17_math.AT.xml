      <title>Symmetric products of Galois-Maximal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is the proof that all the symmetric products of a finite Galois-Maximal space are Galois-Maximal spaces. This applies to the special case of real algebraic varieties, solving the problem first stated by Biswas and D'Mello in \cite{biswas&amp;d'mello:symmetric_products_M-curves} about symmetric products of Maximal curves. We also give characterisations of these spaces and state a new definition that generalises to a larger class of spaces. Then, we extend the characterisation in terms of the Borel cohomology given in \cite{us} to the new family. Finally, we introduce the notion of cohomological stability and cohomological splitting, provide a systematic treatment and relate them with the properties of being a Maximal or Galois-Maximal space. These cohomological properties play an important role in the proof of our main theorem.</description>

      <title>Foundations of geometric cohomology: from co-orientations to product structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript develops a geometric approach to ordinary cohomology of smooth manifolds, constructing a cochain complex model based on co-oriented smooth maps from manifolds with corners. Special attention is given to the pull-back product of such smooth maps, which provides our geometric cochains with a partially defined product structure inducing the cup product in cohomology. A parallel treatment of homology is also given allowing for a geometric unification of the contravariant and covariant theories.</description>

      <title>Cyclic homology of categorical coalgebras and the free loop space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the cyclic chain complex of the categorical coalgebra of singular chains on an arbitrary topological space $X$ is naturally quasi-isomorphic to the $S^1$-equivariant chains of the free loop space of $X$. This statement does not require any hypotheses on $X$ or on the commutative ring of coefficients. Along the way, we introduce a family of polytopes, coined as Goodwillie polytopes, that controls the combinatorics behind the relationship of the coHochschild complex of a categorical coalgebra and the Hochschild complex of its associated differential graded category.</description>

      <title>$T$-equivariant motives of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the construction of the stable homotopy category by Khan-Ravi to calculate the integral $T$-equivariant $K$-theory spectrum of a flag variety over an affine scheme, where $T$ is a split torus associated to the flag variety. More precisely, we show that the $T$-equivariant $K$-theory ring spectrum of a flag variety is decomposed into a direct sum of $K$-theory spectra of the classifying stack $\text{B}T$ indexed by the associated Weyl group. We also explain how to relate these results to the motivic world and deduce classical results for $T$-equivariant intersection theory and $K$-theory of flag varieties.\par For this purpose, we analyze the motive of schemes stratified by affine spaces with group action, that preserves these stratifications. We work with cohomology theories, that satisfy certain vanishing conditions, which are satisfied for example by motivic cohomology and $K$-Theory.</description>

      <title>Simplicial Representation Learning with Neural $k$-Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric deep learning extends deep learning to incorporate information about the geometry and topology data, especially in complex domains like graphs. Despite the popularity of message passing in this field, it has limitations such as the need for graph rewiring, ambiguity in interpreting data, and over-smoothing. In this paper, we take a different approach, focusing on leveraging geometric information from simplicial complexes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ using node coordinates. We use differential k-forms in \mathbb{R}^n to create representations of simplices, offering interpretability and geometric consistency without message passing. This approach also enables us to apply differential geometry tools and achieve universal approximation. Our method is efficient, versatile, and applicable to various input complexes, including graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes. It outperforms existing message passing neural networks in harnessing information from geometrical graphs with node features serving as coordinates.</description>
