      <title>Bayesian tit-for-tat fosters cooperation in evolutionary stochastic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from experience is a key feature of decision-making in cognitively complex organisms. Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential strategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices to be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas. Bayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their ability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate whether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when actions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs by changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the change in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions. By considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a resource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under which Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive strategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large class of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation leading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of success of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool and the rule governing transition between the two different resource states.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary learning of microbial populations in partially predictable environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Populations evolving in fluctuating environments face the fundamental challenge of balancing adaptation to current conditions against preparation for uncertain futures. Here, we study microbial evolution in partially predictable environments using proteome allocation models that capture the trade-off between growth rate and lag time during environmental transitions. We demonstrate that evolution drives populations toward an evolutionary stable allocation strategy that minimizes resource depletion time, thereby balancing faster growth with shorter adaptation delays. In environments with temporal structure, populations evolve to learn the statistical patterns of environmental transitions through proteome pre-allocation, with the evolved allocations reflecting the transition probabilities between conditions. Our framework reveals how microbial populations can extract and exploit environmental predictability without explicit neural computation, using the proteome as a distributed memory system that encodes environmental patterns. This work demonstrates how information-theoretic principles govern cellular resource allocation and provides a mechanistic foundation for understanding learning-like behavior in evolving biological systems.</description>

      <title>A More Convex Ising Formulation of Max-3-Cut Using Higher-Order Spin Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are naturally expressed using variables that take on more than two discrete values. To solve such problems using Ising machines (IMs) - specialized analog or digital devices designed to solve COPs efficiently - these multi-valued integers must be encoded using binary spin variables. A common approach is one-hot encoding, where each variable is represented by a group of spins constrained so that exactly one spin is in the "up" state. However, this encoding introduces energy barriers: changing an integer's value requires flipping two spins and passing through an invalid intermediate state. This creates rugged energy landscapes that may hinder optimization. We propose a higher-order Ising formulation for Max-3-Cut, which is the smallest fundamental COP with multi-valued integer variables. Our formulation preserves valid configurations under single-spin updates. The resulting energy landscapes are smoother, and we show that this remains true even when the binary variables are relaxed to continuous values, making it well-suited for analog IMs as well. Benchmarking on such an IM, we find that the higher-order formulation leads to significantly faster solutions than the Ising baseline. Interestingly, we find that an empirical rescaling of some terms in the Ising formulation - a heuristic proposed in prior work - approaches the performance of the higher-order Ising formulation, underscoring the importance of empirical parameter tuning in COP encodings.</description>

      <title>Agentic Information Theory: Ergodicity and Intrinsic Semantics of Information Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop information theory for the temporal behavior of memoryful agents moving through complex -- structured, stochastic -- environments. We introduce and explore information processes -- stochastic processes produced by cognitive agents in real-time as they interact with and interpret incoming stimuli. We provide basic results on the ergodicity and semantics of the resulting time series of Shannon information measures that monitor an agent's adapting view of uncertainty and structural correlation in its environment.</description>
