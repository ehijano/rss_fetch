      <title>On the Jump Conditions for Shock Waves in Condensed Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we have proposed Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) boundary conditions at the normal shock front, which is passing through the condensed material. These RH conditions are quite general, and their convenient forms for the particle velocity, mass density, pressure, and temperature have been presented in terms of the upstream Mach number and the material parameters for the weak and the strong shocks, respectively. Finally, the effects on the mechanical quantities of the shock-compressed materials, e.g., titanium Ti6Al4V, stainless steel 304, aluminum 6061-T6, etc., have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Complexity of Materials with Assembly Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the evolution and complexity of materials is of importance in many areas of science and engineering, where a central open challenge is developing experimental complexity measurements to distinguish random structures from evolved or engineered materials. Assembly Theory (AT) was developed to measure complexity produced by selection, evolution and technology. Here, we extend the fundamentals of AT to quantify complexity in inorganic molecules and solid-state periodic objects such as crystals, minerals and microprocessors, showing how the framework of AT can be used to distinguish naturally formed materials from evolved and engineered ones by quantifying the amount of assembly using the assembly equation defined by AT. We show how tracking the Assembly of repeated structures within a material allows us formalizing the complexity of materials in a manner accessible to measurement. We confirm the physical relevance of our formal approach, by applying it to phase transformations in crystals using the HCP to FCC transformation as a model system. To explore this approach, we introduce random stacking faults in closed-packed systems simplified to one-dimensional strings and demonstrate how Assembly can track the phase transformation. We then compare the Assembly of closed-packed structures with random or engineered faults, demonstrating its utility in distinguishing engineered materials from randomly structured ones. Our results have implications for the study of pre-genetic minerals at the origin of life, optimization of material design in the trade-off between complexity and function, and new approaches to explore material technosignatures which can be unambiguously identified as products of engineered design.</description>

      <title>Atom identification in bilayer moire materials with Gomb-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moire patterns in van der Waals bilayer materials complicate the analysis of atomic-resolution images, hindering the atomic-scale insight typically attainable with scanning transmission electron microscopy. Here, we report a method to detect the positions and identity of atoms in each of the individual layers that compose bilayer heterostructures. We developed a deep learning model, Gomb-Net, which can distinguish atomic species in each individual layer, effectively deconvoluting the moire pattern to enable layer-specific mapping of strain and dopant distributions, unlike other methods which struggle with moire-induced complexity. Using this approach, we explored Se atom substitutional sites in a twisted fractional Janus WS2-WS2(1-x)Se2x heterostructure and found that layer specific implantation sites are unaffected by the moire pattern's local energetic or electronic modulation. This advancement enables atom-identification within material regimes where it was not possible before, opening new insights into previously inaccessible material physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring the mechanism of phase transitions between the hexagonal close-packed and the cuboidal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing appropriate lattice parameters for a bi-lattice smoothly connecting the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) with the cuboidal structures, namely the body-centered (bcc) and the face centered cubic (fcc) lattices, we were able to map out the minimum energy path for a Burgers-Bain type of phase transition. We demonstrate that for three different models applied, i.e. the kissing hard-sphere model, the Lennard-Jones potential, and density functional theory for metallic lithium, the direct transition path is always from hcp to fcc with a separate path leading from fcc to bcc. This solves, at least for the models considered here, a long-standing controversy of whether or not fcc acts as an intermediate phase in martensitic type of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Strain energy enhanced room-temperature magnetocaloric effect in second-order magnetic transition materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large magnetic entropy change (deltaSM) can realize a prominent heat transformation under the magnetic field and directly strengthen the efficacy of the magnetocaloric effect, which provides a pioneering environmentally friendly solid-state strategy to improve refrigeration capacities and efficiencies. The second-order magnetic transition (SOMT) materials have broader deltaSM peaks without thermal hysteresis compared with most first-order magnetic transition materials, making them highly attractive in magnetic refrigeration, especially in the room temperature range. Here, we report a significant enhancement of deltaSM at room temperature in single-crystal Mn5Ge3. In this SOMT system, we realize a 60% improvement of -deltaSM from 3.5 J/kgK to 5.6 J/kgK at T = 300K. This considerable enhancement of deltaSM is achieved by intentionally introducing strain energy through high-pressure constrained deformation. Both experimental results and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the enhancement of deltaSM originates from the microscopic strain and lattice deformation induced by strain energy after deformation. This strain energy will reconstruct the energy landscape of this ferromagnetic system and enhance magnetization, resulting in a giant intensity of magnetocaloric responses. Our findings provide an approach to increase magnetic entropy change and may give fresh ideas for exploring advanced magnetocaloric materials.</description>

      <title>Large Spin Nernst Effect in Ni70Cu30 Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay among heat, spin, and charge is the central focus in spin caloritronic research. While the longitudinal heat-to-spin conversion via the spin Seebeck effect has been intensively studied, the transverse heat-to-spin conversion via the spin Nernst effect (SNE) has not been equally explored. One major challenge is the minuscule signals generated by the SNE, which are often mixed with the background noises. In this work, we overcome this difficulty by studying the thin films of Ni70Cu30 alloy with not only a sizable spin Hall angle but also a large Seebeck coefficient. We observe in the Ni70Cu30 alloy a large spin Nernst effect with an estimated spin Nernst angle ranging from -28% to -72%. In comparison, the spin Nernst angle for Pt is -8.2%. Our ab initio calculation reveals that the large spin Nernst conductivity in Ni70Cu30 is caused by the Fermi energy shift to the steepest slope of the spin Hall conductivity curve due to electron doping from 30% Cu. Our study provides critical directions in searching for materials with a large spin Nernst effect.</description>

      <title>Evidence of magnetoelastic coupling and magnetic phase coexistence in Mn$_{1.7}$Fe$_{1.3}$Si Heusler Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear metallic antiferromagnets, with their rapid spin dynamics, efficient spin transport, and distinctive spin textures, play a pivotal role in advancing the field of spintronics. In this study, we report a comprehensive investigation of the structural, magnetic, and transport properties of cubic Mn$_{1.7}$Fe$_{1.3}$Si Heusler compound. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurement reveals a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at $T_C$ = 85 K, followed by a spin reorientation transition. Neutron diffraction data, analyzed as a function of temperature, demonstrates that the occurrence of a spin-reorientation transition is accompanied by magnetoelastic coupling, as evidenced by a change in unit cell volume below $T_C$. Magnetic structure refinement of the low-temperature neutron powder diffraction data confirms the canted antiferromagnetic ordering below 55 K. The metallic nature of the sample is confirmed by the gradual decrease in the $\rho$(T) with decreasing temperature. At low temperatures, a field-induced metamgnetic transition is observed in both, magnetization and magneto-transport measurements. The $H-T$ phase diagram shows a phase-coexistence region emerging at low temperatures for H $&lt;$ 2.5 T. These findings provide valuable insights into the magnetic and transport behavior of the Heusler compounds, underscoring their potential for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Structural and Dielectric Changes in Liquid Water at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the pressure-dependent dielectric properties of water is crucial for a wide range of scientific and practical applications. In this study, we employ a deep neural network trained on density functional theory data to investigate the dielectric properties of liquid water at room temperature across a pressure range of 0.1 MPa to 1000 MPa. We observe a nonlinear increase in the static dielectric constant $\epsilon_0$ with increasing pressure, a trend that is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. This increase in $\epsilon_0$ is primarily attributed to the increase in water density under compression, which enhances collective dipole fluctuations within the hydrogen-bonding network as well as the dielectric response. Despite the increase in $\epsilon_0$, our results reveal a decrease in the Kirkwood correlation factor $G_K$ with increasing pressure. This decrease in $G_K$ is attributed to pressure-induced structural distortions in the hydrogen-bonding network, which weaken dipolar correlations by disrupting the ideal tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Phase Magnitudes of Open-Source Focused-Probe 4D-STEM Ptychography Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate computational ptychographic phase reconstructions are enabled by fast direct-electron cameras with high dynamic ranges used for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM). The availability of open software packages is making such analyses widely accessible, and especially when implemented in Python, easy to compare in terms of computational efficiency and reconstruction quality. In this contribution, I reconstruct atomic phase shifts from convergent-beam electron diffraction maps of pristine monolayer graphene, which is an ideal dose-robust uniform phase object, acquired on a Dectris ARINA detector installed in a Nion UltraSTEM 100 operated at 60 keV with a focused-probe convergence semi-angle of 34 mrad. For two different recorded maximum scattering angle settings, I compare a range of direct and iterative open-source phase reconstruction algorithms, evaluating their computational efficiency and tolerance to reciprocal-space binning and real-space thinning of the data. The quality of the phase images is assessed by quantifying the variation of atomic phase shifts using a robust parameter-based method revealing an overall agreement with some notable differences in the absolute magnitudes and the variation of the phases. Although such variation is not a major issue when analyzing data with many identical atoms, it does put limits on what level of precision can be relied upon for unique sites such as defects or dopants, which also tend to be more dose-sensitive. Overall, these findings and the accompanying open data and code provide useful guidance for the sampling required for desired levels of phase precision, and suggest particular care is required when relying on electron ptychography for quantitative analyses of atomic-scale electromagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Band Structure Engineering, Optical, Transport, and Photocatalytic Properties of Pristine and Doped Nb3O7(OH): A Systematic DFT Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nb3O2(OH) has emerged as a highly attractive photocatalyst based on its chemical stability, energetic band positions, and large active lattice sites. Compared to other various photocatalytic semiconductors, it can be synthesized easily. This study presents a systematic analysis of pristine and doped Nb3O7(OH) based on recent developments in related research. The current study summarizes the modeling approach and computationally used techniques for doped Nb3O7(OH) based photocatalysts, focusing on their structural properties, defects engineering, and band structure engineering. This study demonstrates that the Trans-Blaha modified Becke Johnson approximation (TB-mBJ) is an effective approach for optoelectronic properties of pristine and Ta/Sb-doped Nb3O7(OH). The generalized gradient approximation is used for structure optimization of all systems studied. Spin-orbit (SO) coupling is also applied to deal with the Ta f orbital and Sb d orbital in the Ta/Sb-doped systems. Doping shifts the energetic band positions and relocates the Fermi level i.e. both the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum are relocated, decreasing the band gap from 1.7 eV (pristine), to 1.266 eV (Ta-doped)/1.203 eV (Sb-doped). Moreover, doped systems shift the optical threshold to the visible region. Transport properties like effective mass and electrical conductivity are calculated, reflecting that the mobility of charge carriers increases with the doping of Ta/Sb atoms.The reduction in the band gap and red-shift in the optical properties of the Ta/Sb-doped Nb3O7(OH) to the visible region suggest their promising potential for photocatalytic activity and photoelectrochemical solar cells.</description>

      <title>Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials are Ready for Solid Ion Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of energy storage technology, high-performance solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have become critical for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. These materials require high ionic conductivity, excellent electrochemical stability, and good mechanical properties to meet the demands of electric vehicles and portable electronics. However, traditional methods like density functional theory (DFT) and empirical force fields face challenges such as high computational costs, poor scalability, and limited accuracy across material systems. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) offer a promising solution with their efficiency and near-DFT-level accuracy.This study systematically evaluates six advanced uMLIP models (MatterSim, MACE, SevenNet, CHGNet, M3GNet, and ORBFF) in terms of energy, forces, thermodynamic properties, elastic moduli, and lithium-ion diffusion behavior. The results show that MatterSim outperforms others in nearly all metrics, particularly in complex material systems, demonstrating superior accuracy and physical consistency. Other models exhibit significant deviations due to issues like energy inconsistency or insufficient training data coverage.Further analysis reveals that MatterSim achieves excellent agreement with reference values in lithium-ion diffusivity calculations, especially at room temperature. Studies on Li3YCl6 and Li6PS5Cl uncover how crystal structure, anion disorder levels, and Na/Li arrangements influence ionic conductivity. Appropriate S/Cl disorder levels and optimized Na/Li arrangements enhance diffusion pathway connectivity, improving overall ionic transport performance.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous in-plane anomalous Hall response observed in a ferromagnetic oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observation of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) induced by magnetic field or spin magnetization lying in the Hall deflection plane has sparked interest in diverse mechanisms for inducing the Hall vector component perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. Such off-diagonal coupling, which is strictly constrained by symmetry of the system, provides new degrees of freedom for engineering Hall responses. However, spontaneous response as extensively studied for out-of-plane AHE remains unexplored. Here we elucidate in-plane AHE in a typical ferromagnetic oxide SrRuO$_3$. The (111)-orientated ultrathin films with in-plane easy axes of spin magnetization exhibit spontaneous AHE at zero field, which is intrinsically coupled to the in-plane spin magnetization and controllable via its direction. Systematic measurements by varying azimuthal and polar field angles further reveal complex Hall responses shaped by higher-order terms allowed by trigonal distortion of the films. Our findings highlight versatile and controllable in-plane Hall responses with out-of-plane orbital ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Modeling metamaterials by second-order rate-type constitutive relations between only the macroscopic stress and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a thermodynamically based approach for constructing effective rate-type constitutive relations describing finite deformations of metamaterials. The effective constitutive relations are formulated as second-order in time rate-type Eulerian constitutive relations between only the Cauchy stress tensor, the Hencky strain tensor and objective time derivatives thereof. In particular, there is no need to introduce additional quantities or concepts such as ``micro-level deformation'',``micromorphic continua'', or elastic solids with frequency dependent material properties.
  Moreover, the linearisation of the proposed fully nonlinear (finite deformations) constitutive relations leads, in Fourier/frequency space, to the same constitutive relations as those commonly used in theories based on the concepts of frequency dependent density and/or stiffness. From this perspective the proposed constitutive relations reproduce the behaviour predicted by the frequency dependent density and/or stiffness models, but yet they work with constant -- that is motion independent -- material properties. This is clearly more convenient from the physical point of view. Furthermore, the linearised version of the proposed constitutive relations leads to the governing partial differential equations that are particularly simple both in Fourier space as well as in physical space.
  Finally, we argue that the proposed fully nonlinear (finite deformations) second-order in time rate-type constitutive relations do not fall into traditional classes of models for elastic solids (hyperelastic solids/Green elastic solids, first-order in time hypoelastic solids), and that the proposed constitutive relations embody a \textit{new} class of constitutive relations characterising elastic solids.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism has emerged as a third fundamental category of collinear magnetism, characterized by spin-splitting in symmetry-compensated collinear antiferromagnets, opening new frontiers in spintronics and condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a novel altermagnetic semiconductor, the asymmetric Janus V$_2$AsBrO monolayer, which exhibits a magnetic easy axis favoring the out-of-plane direction and a N\'{e}el temperature ($T_N$) exceeding room temperature. The system exhibits a strain-tunable piezovalley effect, generating valley polarization under uniaxial strain. Notably, hole doping under uniaxial strain generates a net magnetization ($M$) through a piezomagnetic mechanism. Additionally, the broken inversion symmetry endows the monolayer with a substantial out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient $d_{31}$ (2.19 pm/V), presenting broad prospects for the development and design of novel piezoelectric devices. Our findings provide a promising candidate material for the advancement of 2D multifunctional devices in nanoelectronics, spintronics, valleytronics, and piezoelectrics.</description>

      <title>The speed of sound and elastic properties of single crystals of inorganic and hybrid lead-free iodide perovskites obtained by femtosecond transient optical reflectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optoelectronic devices operate under continuous thermal stress that may influence both long-term stability and optical properties of the active material. It is therefore useful to know the elastic properties of the active materials. In general, the elastic constants of a material may be deduced by the measurement of the speed of sound in that material. In this work, we report on the measurements of the speed of sound in three lead-free halide perovskites, namely the inorganic Cs3Bi2I9 and the hybrid MA3Bi2I9 and MA3Sb2I9, by means of femtosecond transient optical reflectivity that shows oscillations of the signal intensity that are related to the strain field caused by the photoexcitation of electron-hole pairs. The values of the speed of sound thus obtained have allowed us to extract the elastic constant, c11, along the propagation direction of the light. The c11 values indicate a lower stiffness of the hybrid materials, an important aspect when designing optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>THz electric field control of spins in collinear antiferromagnet Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea to find a magnet that responds to an electric field as efficiently as to its magnetic counterpart has long intrigued people's minds and recently became a cornerstone for future energy efficient and nano-scalable technologies for magnetic writing and information processing. In contrast to electric currents, a control by electric fields promises much lower dissipations and in contrast to magnetic fields, electric fields are easier to apply to a nanoscale bit. Recently, the idea to find materials and mechanisms facilitating a strong and simultaneously fast response of spins to electric field has fueled an intense research interest to electromagnons in non-collinear antiferromagnets. Here we show that THz spin resonance at the frequency 0.165 THz in collinear antiferromagnet Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$, which does not host any electromagnons, can be excited by both THz magnetic and electric fields. The mechanisms result in comparable effects on spin dynamics, when excited by freely propagating electromagnetic wave, but have different dependencies on the orientation of the applied THz electric field and the antiferromagnetic N\'eel vector. Hence this discovery opens up new chapters in the research areas targeting to reveal novel principles for the fastest and energy efficient information processing - ultrafast magnetism, antiferromagnetic spintronics, and THz magnonics.</description>

      <title>Low-Defect Quantum Dot Lasers Directly Grown on Silicon Exhibiting Low Threshold Current and High Output Power at Elevated Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct growth of III-V materials on silicon is a key enabler for developing monolithically integrated lasers, offering substantial potential for ultra-dense photonic integration in vital communications and computing technologies. However, the III-V/Si lattice and thermal expansion mismatch pose significant hurdles, leading to defects that degrade lasing performance. This study overcomes this challenge, demonstrating InAs/GaAs-on-Si lasers that perform on par with top-tier lasers on native GaAs substrates. This is achieved through a newly developed epitaxial approach comprising a series of rigorously optimised growth strategies. Atomic-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments reveal exceptional material quality in the active region, and elucidate the impact of each growth strategy on defect dynamics. The optimised III-V-on-silicon ridge-waveguide lasers demonstrate a continuous-wave threshold current as low as 6 mA and high-temperature operation reaching 165 {\deg}C. At 80 {\deg}C, critical for data centre applications, they maintain a 12-mA threshold and 35 mW output power. Furthermore, lasers fabricated on both Si and GaAs substrates using identical processes exhibit virtually identical average threshold current. By eliminating the performance limitations associated with the GaAs/Si mismatch, this study paves the way for robust and high-density integration of a broad spectrum of critical III-V photonic technologies into the silicon ecosystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying orbital textures and their effects on the electronic properties of quantum materials is a critical element in developing orbitronic devices. However, orbital effects are often entangled with the spin degree of freedom, making it difficult to uniquely identify them in charge transport phenomena. Here, we present a combination of scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) current imaging, global transport measurements, and theoretical analysis, that reveals a direct contribution of orbital textures to the linear charge transport of 2D systems. Specifically, we show that in the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, which lacks both rotation and inversion symmetries, an anisotropic orbital Rashba coupling leads to conductivity anisotropy in zero magnetic field. We experimentally demonstrate this result by locally measuring the conductivity anisotropy, and correlating its appearance to the non-linear Hall effect, showing that the two phenomena have a common origin. Our results lay the foundations for an all--electrical probing of orbital currents in two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and a van Hove singularity confined to the surface of a topological semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between electronic topology and superconductivity is the subject of great current interest in condensed matter physics. For example, superconductivity induced on the surface of topological insulators is predicted to be triplet in nature, while the interplay between electronic correlations and topology may lead to unconventional superconductivity as in twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we unveil an unconventional two-dimensional superconducting state in the recently discovered Dirac nodal line semimetal ZrAs2 which is exclusively confined to the top and bottom surfaces within the crystal's ab plane. As a remarkable consequence of this emergent state, we observe a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, the hallmark of two-dimensional superconductivity. Notably, this is the first observation of a BKT transition on the surface of a three-dimensional system. Furthermore, employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we find that these same surfaces also host a two-dimensional van Hove singularity near the Fermi energy. The proximity of van Hove singularity to the Fermi level leads to enhanced electronic correlations contributing to the stabilization of superconductivity at the surface of ZrAs2, a unique phenomenon among topological semimetals. The surface-confined nature of the van Hove singularity, and associated superconductivity, realized for the first time, opens new avenues to explore the interplay between low-dimensional quantum topology, correlations, and superconductivity in a bulk material without resorting to the superconducting proximity effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson-junction interferometry has played a pivotal role in uncovering unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates. Using a Ginzburg-Landau-like approach, we generalize previous results to the genuine multi-gap case. Thus, we show that fractional flux oscillations of the Josephson critical current can arise as a direct consequence of multi-gap superconductivity. These oscillations reveal key information about the underlying superconducting states, including the unconventional $s_\pm$-wave state. Thus, our findings suggest new phase-sensitive experiments to characterize the Cooper pairing of new emerging superconductors such as the nickelates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in topological insulators (TIs) induce backscattering via magnetic torque, unlike pristine TIs where spin-orbit locking promotes dissipationless surface states. Here we reveal that one can suppress that unwanted backscattering and dissipation in magnetic TIs using high-frequency linearly polarized light (LPL). By carefully considering the hexagonal warping of the Fermi surface of the TI, we demonstrate how the coupling between Dirac surface states and LPL can effectively reduce backscattering on magnetic dopants, enhance carrier mobility and suppress resistance, even entirely. These findings open up avenues for designing ultra low-power sensing and spintronic technology.</description>

      <title>Agentic End-to-End De Novo Protein Design for Tailored Dynamics Using a Language Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are dynamic molecular machines whose biological functions, spanning enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, and structural adaptation, are intrinsically linked to their motions. Designing proteins with targeted dynamic properties, however, remains a challenge due to the complex, degenerate relationships between sequence, structure, and molecular motion. Here, we introduce VibeGen, a generative AI framework that enables end-to-end de novo protein design conditioned on normal mode vibrations. VibeGen employs an agentic dual-model architecture, comprising a protein designer that generates sequence candidates based on specified vibrational modes and a protein predictor that evaluates their dynamic accuracy. This approach synergizes diversity, accuracy, and novelty during the design process. Via full-atom molecular simulations as direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed proteins accurately reproduce the prescribed normal mode amplitudes across the backbone while adopting various stable, functionally relevant structures. Notably, generated sequences are de novo, exhibiting no significant similarity to natural proteins, thereby expanding the accessible protein space beyond evolutionary constraints. Our work integrates protein dynamics into generative protein design, and establishes a direct, bidirectional link between sequence and vibrational behavior, unlocking new pathways for engineering biomolecules with tailored dynamical and functional properties. This framework holds broad implications for the rational design of flexible enzymes, dynamic scaffolds, and biomaterials, paving the way toward dynamics-informed AI-driven protein engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the impact of magnetic impurity substitution on the quantum disordered magnetic ground state of NaRuO$_2$. Local $S=5/2$ moments are introduced into the frustrated triangular lattice of $J_{eff}=1/2$ Ru moments via Fe-substitution in NaFe$_x$Ru$_{1-x}$O$_2$, and the evolution of the magnetic ground state is reported. Local spin freezing associated with conventional spin glass behavior is observed upon Fe substitution, marking an impurity-induced freezing of the primarily dynamic magnetic ground state in NaRuO$_2$. Furthermore, local Fe moments induce a Curie-Weiss magnetic behavior in the uniform magnetic susceptibility, and the local moment magnitude is best described by dynamic Ru moments polarized about impurity sites. Our results establish an impurity-doping phenomenology consistent with inherently dynamic moments in NaRuO$_2$ that are pinned by local magnetic impurities, similar to ``swiss cheese" models of impurity-substituted copper oxides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets with spin splitting in the electronic structure are desired for novel spintronic phenomena in materials with nearly zero net magnetization. One of the simplest spin-split antiferromagnetic states, the $p$-wave magnet, is proposed as a result of collective instability of electron gases. Following a more recent theoretical proposal without strong electron correlations, we here report a material with the symmetry constraints for $p$-wave magnetism of conduction electrons in momentum space, based on a texture of magnetic moments in direct space. Our resonant X-ray scattering reveals coplanar, lattice-locked antiferromagnetism that satisfies the required conditions for a $p$-wave magnet: it breaks space inversion, but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a positional shift in direct space. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the electric conductivity is characteristically anisotropic in this $p$-wave magnet. In conducting magnets, the coupling of magnetic spins and freely moving electrons favors small distortions of the $p$-wave state, slightly breaking the $T$ symmetry and inducing a tiny net magnetization. In our material, this gentle symmetry breaking induces an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with a giant anomalous Hall conductivity for a bulk antiferromagnet, $\sigma_{xy}&gt;600\,$S/cm (Hall angle $&gt;3\,\%$). The $p$-wave magnet has characteristic spin-nodal planes, and such a giant AHE can be attributed to hybridization of electron bands around these nodal regions due to $T$ breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Polar Metallic phase in Ultra-Thin Epitaxially-Strained RuO2 Films</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetism refers to a wide class of magnetic orders featuring magnetic sublattices with opposite spins related by rotational symmetries, resulting in non-trivial spin splitting and magnetic multipoles. However, the direct observation of the altermagnetic order parameter remains elusive. Here, by combining theoretical analysis, electrical transport, X-ray and optical spectroscopies, we establish a phase diagram in hybrid molecular beam epitaxy-grown RuO2/TiO2 (110) films, mapping symmetries along with altermagnetic/electronic/structural phase transitions as functions of film thickness and temperature. This features a novel altermagnetic metallic polar phase in epitaxially-strained 2 nm films, extending the concept of multiferroicity to altermagnets. Such a clear signature of a magnetic phase transition at ~500 K is observed exclusively in ultrathin strained films, unlike in bulk RuO2 single crystals. These results demonstrate the potential of epitaxial heterostructure design to induce altermagnetism, paving the way for emergent novel phases with multifunctional properties.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of Mn substitution in Fe$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sn on electronic structure and magnetic and electrical transport properties. The spin-polarized density of states calculations using density-functional theory (DFT) yields a half-metallic ground state in Mn-rich compositions. Localized magnetic moments at Mn sites interacting through the cloud of conduction electrons formed by Fe and Ti atoms are also predicted. Electrical resistivity and magneto-transport measurements reveal a Kondo-like ground state at low temperatures and a peculiar linear negative temperature coefficient of resistance in the high-temperature regime with a predominant electron-phonon scattering mechanism. Analysis of room temperature powder X-ray diffraction data reveals a highly ordered L2$_1$ structure and reduction of antisite disorder upon Mn substitution. The temperature-dependent magnetization measurements reveal distinct features indicative of weak anisotropy in the system. Isothermal magnetization measured as a function of the applied field helps identify the unique magnetic ground state of the half-metallic Fe$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sn composition as a ferromagnet with a wandering axis that distinctively orients in the direction of the applied magnetic field. The measurement of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) reveals that the random anisotropy arises due to the local lattice distortion around Mn atoms in the prepared compositions. Our findings thus provide a new perspective for studying the mechanism of half-metallicity and associated magnetic order in Heuslers.</description>

      <title>Radar shielding experiments by composite bilayer magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An experimental strong increase of the reflection loss (from 25 up to 35 dBs) and an extension of the absorption bandwidth up to 20% is measured in a set of novel functional bilayer systems. We focus our work on studying the samples in an anechoic chamber under far-field real radar conditions. Each layer consists of a composite material, typically a dielectric matrix filled with random anisotropy hexaferrite and soft metallic materials (powder or wires). Combining the two types of materials into a submillimetric bilayer structure has shown unprecedented improvements in microwave absorption capacities compared to the former absorption of each layer. The capacity to improve the shielding behavior is strongly related to each layer permittivity, permeability, and thickness leading, therefore, to a strong control over the design of novel materials for stealth applications.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of thermal hysteresis in the molecular dynamics of barocaloric neopentyl glycol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the benchmark BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe directly the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bond network, distinguishing for the first time the molecular reorientation and hydroxymethyl rotational modes. We showcase the use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window scans in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition, directly tracking the molecular dynamics of the phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-mediated quantum coherence of $W^{5+}$ spins in an oxygen-deficient double perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elucidating the factors limiting quantum coherence in real materials is essential to the development of quantum technologies. Here we report a strategic approach to determine the effect of lattice dynamics on spin coherence lifetimes using oxygen deficient double perovskites as host materials. In addition to obtaining millisecond $T_1$ spin-lattice lifetimes at T ~ 10 K, measurable quantum superpositions were observed up to room temperature. We determine that $T_2$ enhancement in $Sr_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ over previously studied $Ba_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ is caused by a dynamically-driven increase in effective site symmetry around the dominant paramagnetic site, assigned as $W^{5+}$ via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Further, a combination of experimental and computational techniques enabled quantification of the relative strength of spin-phonon coupling of each phonon mode. This analysis demonstrates the effect of thermodynamics and site symmetry on the spin lifetimes of $W^{5+}$ paramagnetic defects, an important step in the process of reducing decoherence to produce longer-lived qubits.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Maximally Localized Wannier Functions via Optimized Projection Functions and Self-projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an automatized approach towards maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) applicable to both occupied and unoccupied states. We overcome limitations of the standard optimized projection function (OPF) method and its approximations by providing an exact expression for the gradient of the Wannier spread functional with respect to a single semi-unitary OPF matrix. Moreover, we demonstrate that the localization of the resulting Wannier functions (WFs) can be further improved by including projections on reasonably localized WFs, so-called self-projections.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) motivated mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods, such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential method, is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW pseudopotential methods we show that there is an explicit all electron reformulation. In the all electron reformulation, in the basis set, there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment relevant to nuclei of the substances studied. Using this as motivation, here we propose a new, PAW method motivated, basis set for small molecules, where we use the LO or lo (Localized Orbitals) basis wave functions, and pair them with a Gaussian basis, e.g. Gaussian type orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). Several different, but related, LO (lo) basis wave functions are considered. We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals, combined with LO or lo orbitals. This is done using shape functions.</description>

      <title>Bounds and anomalies of inhomogeneous anomalous Hall effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well recognized that interpreting transport experiment results can be challenging when the samples being measured are spatially nonuniform. However, quantitative understanding on the differences between measured and actual transport coefficients, especially the Hall effects, in inhomogeneous systems is lacking. In this work we use homogenization theory to find exact bounds of the measured or homogenized anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in inhomogeneous conductors under minimal assumptions. In particular, we prove that the homogenized AHC cannot exceed the bounds of the local AHC. However, in common experimental setups, anomalies that appear to violate the above bounds can occur, with a popular example being the "humps" or "dips" of the Hall hysteresis curves usually ascribed to the topological Hall effect (THE). We give two examples showing how such apparent anomalies could be caused by different types of inhomogeneities and discuss their relevance in experiments.</description>

      <title>Flexible radio-frequency transistors exceeding 100 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) transistors based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{T}}$) and power gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{max}}$) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz, with low power consumption of 199 mW/mm and 147 mW/mm, respectively, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly 100$\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF devices. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve output power of 64 mW/mm and power gain of 11 dB in the K-band (18 GHz), marking a significant milestone in the development of flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Aware Bayesian Flow Networks for Crystal Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new crystalline materials is essential to scientific and technological progress. However, traditional trial-and-error approaches are inefficient due to the vast search space. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled generative models to predict new stable materials by incorporating structural symmetries and to condition the generation on desired properties. In this work, we introduce SymmBFN, a novel symmetry-aware Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) for crystalline material generation that accurately reproduces the distribution of space groups found in experimentally observed crystals. SymmBFN substantially improves efficiency, generating stable structures at least 50 times faster than the next-best method. Furthermore, we demonstrate its capability for property-conditioned generation, enabling the design of materials with tailored properties. Our findings establish BFNs as an effective tool for accelerating the discovery of crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using an equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)] which has been justified on the basis of extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the phase diagram of hard spheres [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions for $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio, $s$, of the standard deviation of the distribution of disk diameters to its mean. For a power-law size distribution with $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].</description>
