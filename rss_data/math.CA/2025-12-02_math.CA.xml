      <title>The Interplay of Shifted Square and Maximal Function Estimates in the Context of Multilinear Fourier Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following their appearance in 2014, so-called shifted square and maximal functions have seen an eruption of use in the study of singular integral operators. In this paper, we will generalize a recent theorem of G. Dosidis, B. Park, and L. Slav\'ikov\'a, which gave a sharp boundedness criterion for certain bilinear Fourier multipliers, to the general multilinear setting. In so doing, we will witness how the combined use of shifted square and maximal functions causes a loss of sharpness; we, then, repair this through a trick, which allows us to remove the shift from the square functions, placing it purely on the maximal functions. As an application to our main theorem, we establish the boundedness of certain singular integrals with rough homogeneous kernels lying in the Orlicz space $L(\log L)^\alpha$ when restricted to the unit sphere. This represents an edge case to what was previously known in the literature.</description>

      <title>The planar Lanchester model of insurgent warfare: Intricate Collateral Damage Functions and Global Bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most notable aspects of mathematical modeling is that it sheds light on the complexities arising from changes in parameters and their real-world implications, thus gaining better insight into the dynamics of economic, political, and security phenomena. Moreover, modifications to mathematical modeling will set the stage for embedding new features into the system and enriching the assessment of our analysis. In the case of the Lanchester model of warfare, the introduction of the collateral damage function was an attempt to turn the model into a more realistic framework for understanding counter-insurgencies and irregular battles. In this article, we focus on addressing the impact of sophisticated collateral damage functions in a modified Lanchester model of combat, which reflects the multifaceted nature of warfare. This analysis shows the possibility of global bifurcations and their repercussions for the combat situation between two players. Finally, we assess the codimension two bifurcation analysis of our system based on the interaction between collateral damage and the effectiveness of targeting insurgents.</description>

      <title>Rough differential equations and reduced rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the existence and uniqueness of solutions for rough differential equations driven by reduced rough paths with low regularity, specifically in the roughness regime $\frac{1}{3} &lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$. While the well-posedness of rough differential equations driven by classical rough paths in this regime is known, the reduced structure presents unique analytical challenges that fall outside the scope of classical theories. By formulating the problem within a suitably constructed Banach space of controlled paths, we implement a fixed point argument based on the Banach contraction principle. This approach provides a direct and self-contained proof, offering a clear and concise alternative to the more intricate machinery of the classical theory of rough differential equations. Our work thus provides a streamlined framework for analyzing this important class of rough equations.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between the smoothness of a plane curve and that of its evolute, especially in the cases where the parent curve is no more two or three times continuously differentiable, and exhibit the same kind of apparent improvement in regularity: in the generic local situation, the evolute has one order of regularity less than the parent curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Raimi's classical partition theorem to the continuous setting of the circle and $n$-dimensional torus. Building on recent work of Hegyv\'ari, Pach, and Pham in finite groups, we prove that there exist measurable partitions of the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^n$ with the property that for any finite measurable cover, some translated part of the cover has positive measure intersection with every partition element. Our proof adapts combinatorial arguments from the finite setting using measure-theoretic techniques and slicing arguments in product spaces.</description>

      <title>Bivariate multiple orthogonal polynomials of mixed type on the step-line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies bivariate multiple orthogonal polynomials of the mixed type on the step-line. The analysis is based on the LU factorization of a moment matrix specifically adapted to this framework. The orthogonality and biorthogonality relations satisfied by these polynomials are identified, and their precise multi-degrees are determined. The corresponding recurrence relations and the growing band matrices that encode them are also derived. Christoffel-Darboux kernels and the associated Christoffel-Darboux-type formulas are obtained. An ABC-type theorem is established, relating the inverse of the truncated moment matrix to these kernels. As an illustration, the bivariate Jacobi-Pi\~neiro multiple orthogonal polynomials of mixed type on the triangle are computed by means of an LU factorization implemented in a dedicated Maple script.</description>

      <title>The Sobolev space $W_2^{1/2}$: Simultaneous improvement of functions by a homeomorphism of the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that for every continuous real-valued function $f$ on the circle $\mathbb T=\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z$ there exists a change of variable, i.e., a self-homeomorphism $h$ of $\mathbb T$, such that the superposition $f\circ h$ is in the Sobolev space $W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$. We obtain new results on simultaneous improvement of functions by a single change of variable in relation to the space $W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$. The main result is as follows: there does not exist a self-homeomorphism $h$ of $\mathbb T$ such that $f\circ h\in W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$ for every $f\in \mathrm{Lip}_{1/2}(\mathbb T)$. Here $\mathrm{Lip}_{1/2}(\mathbb T)$ is the class of all functions on $\mathbb T$ satisfying the Lipschitz condition of order $1/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gabor phase retrieval stands for recovering a square integrable function up to a global phase from absolute values of its Gabor transform. In this paper, we study Gabor phase retrieval from discrete samples. We consider three types of sampling sequences, which include square root lattices, square root sequences on two intersecting lines and on three parallel lines respectively. In all cases we give the optimal sampling density for a sequence to do Gabor phase retrieval.</description>

Abstract: P\'{o}lya's conjecture on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian has been one of the core problems in spectral geometry. Building upon the recent breakthrough works on P\'{o}lya's conjecture for balls and annuli by Filonov, Levitin, Polterovich and Sher, we study several aspects of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for balls and cylinders: by refining the purely analytical portion of the proof in [2] for the Neumann P\'{o}lya's conjecture for the disk, we extend the regime of the spectral parameter that can be established without computer assistance; we obtain improvement of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for disks and balls; we obtain improvement of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for cylinders and confirm the Neumann P\'{o}lya's conjecture for cylinders in $\mathbb{R}^3$. As a supplementary effort, we study Weyl's law for cylinders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent discovery of Eldan and Gross states that there exists a universal $C&gt;0$ such that for all Boolean functions $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \{-1,1\}$,
  $$
  \int_{\{-1,1\}^n}\sqrt{s_f(x)}d\mu(x) \ge C\text{Var}(f)\sqrt{\log \left(1+\frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{Inf}_j(f)^2}\right)}
  $$
  where $s_f(x)$ is the sensitivity of $f$ at $x$, $\text{Var}(f)$ is the variance of $f$, $\text{Inf}_j(f)$ is the influence of $f$ along the $j$-th variable, and $\mu$ is the uniform probability measure. In this note, we give an alternative proof that applies to biased discrete hypercube, and spaces having positive Ricci curvature lower bounds in the sense of Bakry and \'Emery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For time-frequency localization operators, related to the short-time Fourier transform, with symbol $R\Omega$, we work out the exact large $R$ eigenvalue behavior for rotationally invariant $\Omega$ and conjecture that the same relation holds for all scaled symbols $R \Omega$ as long as the window is the standard Gaussian. Specifically, we conjecture that the $k$-th eigenvalue of the localization operator with symbol $R\Omega$ converges to $\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{erfc}\big( \sqrt{2\pi}\frac{k-R^2|\Omega|}{R|\partial \Omega|} \big)$ as $R \to \infty$. To support the conjecture, we compute the eigenvalues of discrete frame multipliers with various symbols using LTFAT and find that they agree with the behavior of the conjecture to a large degree.</description>

      <title>Relaxation equations with stretched non-local operators: renewal and time-changed processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study renewal processes defined by means of extensions of the standard relaxation equation through ``stretched" non-local operators (of order $\alpha$ and with parameter $\gamma$). In a first case we obtain a generalization of the fractional Poisson process, which displays either infinite or finite expected waiting times between arrivals, depending on the parameter $\gamma$. Therefore, the introduction in the operator of the non-homogeneous term driven by $\gamma$ allows us to regulate the transition between different regimes of our renewal process. We then consider a second-order relaxation-type equation involving the same operator, under different sets of conditions on the constants involved; for a particular choice of these constants, we prove that the corresponding renewal process is linked to the first one by convex combination of its distributions. We also discuss alternative models related to the same equations and their time-changed representation, in terms of the inverse of a non-decreasing process which generalizes the $\alpha$-stable L\'evy subordinator.</description>

Abstract: We continue the~study of embeddings between different classes of Sobolev spaces of differential forms started in 2006 in a~paper by Gol$'$dshtein and Troyanov. As in this paper, our study is based on relations between $L_{q,p}$-cohomology and Sobolev type inequalities. The~main results are estimates for the norms of the embedding operators for $q=p$ and $p&gt;\frac{n-1}{k-1}$ in the~Euclidean $r$-ball $B(r)$ and its bi-Lipschitz images. We also study the~compactness of such operators.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Gr\"unwald Interpolation Operators on Chebyshev Nodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1941, G. Gr\"unwald proved the convergence of a sequence of operators constructed using classical Lagrange interpolation at Chebyshev nodes. In this work, we establish a perturbed version of Gr\"unwald's result, thereby extending the class of admissible nodal points. Specifically, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence when the interpolation nodes are of the form {cos eta_k} for k = 1, ..., n, where {eta_k} is a general sequence. We refer to these operators as Gr\"unwald operators. In particular, we prove a convergence result when {eta_k} is equidistant and uniformly distributed. We establish a Voronovskaja-type estimate for the convergence of these operators and derive quantitative results using modulus of continuity.</description>
