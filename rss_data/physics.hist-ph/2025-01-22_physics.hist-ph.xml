      <title>Not Quite Killing It: Black Hole Evaporation, Global Energy, and De-Idealization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of arguments for black hole evaporation relies on conservation laws, defined through symmetries represented by Killing vector fields which exist globally or asymptotically. However, these symmetries often rely on the idealizations of stationarity and asymptotic flatness, respectively. In non-stationary or non-asymptotically-flat spacetimes where realistic black holes evaporate, the requisite Killing fields typically do not exist. Can we 'de-idealize' these idealizations, and subsequently the associated arguments for black hole evaporation? Here, I critically examine the strategy of using 'approximately Killing' fields to de-idealize black hole spacetimes and approximately extend conservation laws to non-idealized cases. I argue that this approach encounters significant challenges, undermining the use of these idealizations to justify the evaporation of realistic -- rather than idealized -- black holes, and raising questions about the justified use of such idealizations.</description>

      <title>Reproducing EPR correlations without superluminal signalling: backward conditional probabilities and Statistical Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell's theorem states that no model that respects Local Causality and Statistical Independence can account for the correlations predicted by quantum mechanics via entangled states. This paper proposes a new approach, using backward-in-time conditional probabilities, which relaxes conventional assumptions of temporal ordering while preserving Statistical Independence as a "fine-tuning condition. It is shown how such models can account for EPR/Bell correlations and, analogously, the GHZ predictions while nevertheless forbidding superluminal signalling.</description>

      <title>History and presentation of the Cavendish experiment in textbooks in the 20th century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experiment performed by Henry Cavendish to measure the density of the earth, is in numerous textbooks described as a measurement of the universal gravitational constant, G, even if we know that this was not true. In this paper, a study on how common this "myth" is based on the checklist developed by Leite on a total of 84 textbooks. The prevalence of the myth in most textbooks throughout the 20th century indicates a focus on the contemporary interests of authors and the physics community in presenting the development of physics. An explanation of the prevalence of the myth and a different approach</description>

      <title>The Simplicity of Physical Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical laws are strikingly simple, yet there is no a priori reason for them to be so. I propose that nomic realists -- Humeans and non-Humeans -- should recognize simplicity as a fundamental epistemic guide for discovering and evaluating candidate physical laws. This proposal helps resolve several longstanding problems of nomic realism and simplicity. A key consequence is that the presumed epistemic advantage of Humeanism over non-Humeanism dissolves, undermining a prominent epistemological argument for Humeanism. Moreover, simplicity is shown to be more connected to lawhood than to mere truth.</description>

      <title>A primer on Carroll gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultra-relativistic limit of general relativity is Carroll gravity. In this article, we provide (i) a rigorous and thorough exposition of the geometric formalism of the 'magnetic' version of Carroll gravity, (ii) a presentation of this theory as a limit of general relativity in a geometrical, 'lightcone-narrowing' sense, and (iii) an exploration of some of the various conceptually interesting features of this version of Carroll gravity.</description>

      <title>On the significance of Wigner's Friend in contexts beyond quantum foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a surge of recent interest in the Wigner's Friend paradox, sparking several novel thought experiments and no-go theorems. The main narrative has been that Wigner's Friend highlights a counterintuitive feature that is unique to quantum theory, and which is closely related to the quantum measurement problem. Here, we challenge this view. We argue that the gist of the Wigner's Friend paradox can be reproduced without assuming quantum physics, and that it underlies a much broader class of enigmas in the foundations of physics and philosophy. To show this, we first consider several recently proposed Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios, and demonstrate that some of their implications for the absoluteness of observations can be reproduced by classical thought experiments that involve the duplication of agents. Crucially, some of these classical scenarios are technologically much easier to implement than their quantum counterparts. Then, we argue that the essential structural ingredient of all these scenarios is a feature that we call "Restriction A": essentially, that a physical theory cannot give us a probabilistic description of the observations of all agents. Finally, we argue that this difficulty is at the core of other puzzles in the foundations of physics and philosophy, and demonstrate this explicitly for cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem. Our analysis suggests that Wigner's Friend should be studied in a larger context, addressing a frontier of human knowledge beyond quantum foundations: to obtain reliable predictions for experiments in which these predictions can be privately but not intersubjectively verified.</description>
