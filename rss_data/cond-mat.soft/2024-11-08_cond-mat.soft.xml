      <title>Odd Viscodiffusive Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of "odd viscodiffusive fluids," which exhibit three-dimensional odd transport phenomena through the coupling of viscous and diffusive transport. In these fluids, diffusive fluxes may arise from orthogonal velocity gradients and, reciprocally, stresses may arise from concentration gradients. We examine microscopic fluctuations using the recently proposed "flux hypothesis" to derive Green-Kubo and reciprocal relations for the governing transport coefficients. These relations suggest that only parity symmetry, and not time-reversal symmetry, must be broken at the microscopic scale to observe these couplings. Chiral liquids, whether passive or active, are therefore a natural choice as viscodiffusive fluids. We then introduce two analytically tractable model systems, namely a generator and a corresponding reciprocal engine, which illustrate the nature of viscodiffusive cross-coupling in chiral matter and enable the experimental measurement of the novel transport coefficients. Finally, we make the case for chiral bacterial suspensions to be odd viscodiffusive fluids, and use our theory to predict the behaviors exhibited in prior experimental microfluidic studies involving bacterial migration in response to shearing flows.</description>

      <title>Colossal Dielectric Permittivity and Superparaelectricity in phenyl pyrimidine based liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of polar rod-shaped liquid crystalline molecules with large dipole moments (mu &gt; 10.4-14.8 D), their molecular structures based on the ferroelectric nematic prototype DIO, are designed, synthesized, and investigated. When the penultimate fluoro-phenyl ring is replaced by phenylpyrimidine moiety, the molecular dipole moment increases from 9.4 D for DIO to 10.4 D for the new molecule and when the terminal fluoro-group is additionally replaced by the nitrile group, the dipole moment rises to 14.8 D. Such a replacement enhances not only the net dipole moment of the molecule, but it also reduces the steric hindrance to rotations of the moieties within the molecule. The superparaelectric nematic (N) and smectic A (SmA) phases of these compounds are found to exhibit colossal dielectric permittivity, obtained both from dielectric spectroscopy, and capacitance measurements using a simple capacitor divider circuit. The electric polarization is measured vs. the field (E). However, no hysteresis in P vs. E is found in the nematic and smectic A phases. The colossal dielectric permittivity persists over the entire fluidic range. The experimental results lead us to conclude that these materials belong to the class of superparaelectrics (SPE) rather than to ferroelectrics due to the absence hysteresis and linear P vs E dependence. The synthesized organic materials are the first fluids for which superparaelectricity is discovered and furthermore these show great potential for the applications in supercapacitors used in storing energy.</description>

      <title>A matter of shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider the fluid-mediated approach of a deformable elastic object ("indenter") to a rigid surface at relatively low velocity. As fluid is squeezed between the tip and the rigid substrate, lubrication pressures develop, which in turn deform the indenter leading edge. I study the influence of the tip geometry over the lubrication pressure distribution. "Low velocity" means that the approach happens slow enough for the body to adapt quasi-statically to the transient viscous pressures triggered in the mediating fluid when squeezed. The salient geometrical simplification is that the indenter shape is axisymmetric, and its height profile goes like $\sim r^n$, $r$ being the radial coordinate measured from the tip and $n$ the exponent that controls the leading edge shape. I inquire if the distribution of pressures induced by the thin lubrication film forming before touchdown corresponds to the pressure distribution predicted by an equivalent "dry" contact mechanics problem. Results show striking resemblance for $n \le 2$ while also partial ability to predict the pressure distribution for $n&gt;2$. Still, the analogy is deemed exceedingly insightful.</description>

      <title>Damage due to Ice Crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The freezing of water is one of the major causes of mechanical damage in materials during wintertime; surprisingly this happens even in situations where water only partially saturates the material so that the ice has room to grow. Here we perform freezing experiments in cylindrical glass vials of various sizes and wettability properties, using a dye that exclusively colors the liquid phase; this allows to precisely observe the freezing front. The visualization reveals that damage occurs in partially water-saturated media when a closed liquid inclusion forms within the ice due to the freezing of air/water meniscus. When this water inclusion subsequently freezes, the volume expansion leads to very high pressures leading to the fracture of both the surrounding ice and the glass vial. The pressure can be understood quantitatively based on thermodynamics which correctly predicts that the crystallization pressure is independent of the volume of the liquid pocket. Finally, our results also reveal that by changing the wetting properties of the confining walls, the formation of the liquid pockets that cause the mechanical damage can be avoided.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow inside slit-shaped nanopores: the role of surface morphology at the molecular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics. In particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales due to various factors. In this context, we investigate the influence of surface morphology in slit-shaped nanopores on the fluid flow. We demonstrate that the surface morphology effectively controls the slip length, which approaches zero when the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid are matched. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls--mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material--that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Hagen-Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively, which correlate with fluid layering and depletion near the surfaces. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity that varies substantially with the pore width. Analysis of the hydrodynamic permeability shows that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. Additionally, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Our findings underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.</description>

      <title>On the Nonlinear Eshelby Inclusion Problem and its Isomorphic Growth Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the late 1950's, Eshelby's linear solutions for the deformation field inside an ellipsoidal inclusion and, subsequently, the infinite matrix in which it is embedded were published. The solutions' ability to capture the behavior of an orthotropically symmetric shaped inclusion made it invaluable in efforts to understand the behavior of defects within, and the micromechanics of, metals and other stiff materials throughout the rest of the 20th century. Over half a century later, we wish to understand the analogous effects of microstructure on the behavior of soft materials; both organic and synthetic; but in order to do so, we must venture beyond the linear limit, far into the nonlinear regime. However, no solutions to these analogous problems currently exist for non-spherical inclusions. In this work, we present an accurate semi-inverse solution for the elastic field in an isotropically growing spheroidal inclusion embedded in an infinite matrix, both made of the same incompressible neo-Hookean material. We also investigate the behavior of such an inclusion as it grows infinitely large, demonstrating the existence of a non-spherical asymptotic shape and an associated asymptotic pressure. We call this the isomorphic limit, and the associated pressure the isomorphic pressure.</description>

      <title>Durotaxis in viscoelastic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organisms often swim through fluids that are spatially inhomogeneous. If the fluids are polymeric, gradients in polymer concentration may lead to gradients in both fluid viscosity and elasticity. In this letter, we present theoretical results for the dynamics of active particles, biological or otherwise, swimming through spatially inhomogeneous viscoelastic fluids. We model the active particles using the squirmer model, and show that spatial variations in fluid relaxation time lead to a novel mechanism for reorientation and taxis in viscoelastic fluids, which we refer to as a form of durotaxis in fluids.</description>

      <title>Velocity fluctuation and force scaling during driven polymer transport through a nanopore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by its central role in many biological processes, the transport of biopolymers across nanoscale pores is at the heart of a single-molecule sensing technology aimed at nucleic acid and protein sequencing, as well as biomarker detection. When electrophoretically driven through a pore by an electric potential gradient, a translocating polymer hinders the flow of ions, producing a transient current blockage signature that can be mapped to physicochemical properties of the polymer. Although investigated theoretically and by simulations, few experimental studies have attempted to validate the predicted transport properties, mainly due to the complex nature of the non-equilibrium translocation process. Here, we elucidate these fundamental concepts by constructing a patterned DNA nanostructure whose current signatures allow measurement of the instantaneous velocity throughout the translocation process. With simple physical insights from polymer and fluid dynamics, we show how the resulting molecular velocity profiles can be used to investigate the nanoscale forces at play and their dependence on experimental parameters such as polymer length, pore size and voltage. These results allow testing of theoretical models and outline their limitations. In addition to bridging experiment and theory, knowledge of the velocity fluctuation and force scaling during passage can assist researchers in designing nanopore experiments with optimized sensing performance.</description>

      <title>The Effect of a Knot on the Thermal Stability of Protein MJ0366: Insights from Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein MJ0366 is a hypothetical protein from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii that has a rare and complex knot in its structure. The knot is a right-handed trefoil knot that involves about half of the protein's residues. In this article, we investigate the thermal stability of protein MJ0366 using numerical simulations based on molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods. We compare the results with those of a similar unknotted protein and analyze the effects of the knot on the folding and unfolding processes. We show that the knot in protein MJ0366 increases its thermal stability by creating a topological barrier that prevents the protein from unfolding at high temperatures. We also discuss the possible biological implications of the knot for the function and evolution of protein MJ0366.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Correlations under Temperature Gradients: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Simple Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fluids under temperature gradients, long-range correlations (LRCs) emerge generically, leading to enhanced density fluctuations. This phenomenon, characterized by the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the static structure factor (where $\boldsymbol{q}$ is the wavenumber), has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. However, they remain unexplored in Hamiltonian particle systems using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This Letter reports the first MD study to provide unambiguous observations of the LRCs. We demonstrate this by three distinct approaches: (1) measuring the static structure factor and directly observing the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence characterizing the LRCs; (2) detecting the corresponding $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the dynamic structure factor; (3) establishing a quantitative agreement between MD results and predictions from fluctuating hydrodynamics, the phenomenological theory that predicts the LRCs. Our findings demonstrate that MD simulations offer a powerful complementary tool to theoretical and experimental investigations of LRCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microswimmers often use chirality to generate translational movement from rotation motion, exhibiting distinct behaviors in complex fluids compared to simple Newtonian fluids. However, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. In this study, we elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the distinct behaviors of microswimmers in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. We show that the enhanced speed of chiral swimmers is attributed to the Weissenberg effect induced by normal stress differences resulting from chiral flows. Additionally, we identify swimmer-specific normal stress differences in a viscoelastic fluid and demonstrate that swimming speed varies depending on whether the swimmer acts as a pusher or a puller. Moreover, we investigate the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of chiral squirmers. When the squirmers are aligned parallel (perpendicular) to their swimming axis, they tend to separate (approach). These findings deepen our comprehension of the rheological properties of viscoelastic fluids containing microswimmers, promising advancements in various applications.</description>

      <title>Understanding long-range opposite charge repulsion in multivalent salt solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrostatic correlations between ions profoundly influence the structure and forces within electrical double layers. Here, we apply the modified Gaussian Renormalized Fluctuation theory to investigate the counter-intuitive phenomenon of repulsion between two oppositely charged surfaces and discuss its relationship with overcharging. By accurately accounting for the effect of spatially varying ion-ion correlations, we capture these repulsive forces for divalent, trivalent as well as tetravalent ions, in quantitative agreement with reported simulation results. We show that the opposite-charge repulsion is long-ranged with an effective length scale of a few nanometers. The strength of opposite-charge repulsion increases monotonically with the multivalent salt concentration, in stark contrast with the non-monotonic salt concentration dependence of other ion correlation-driven phenomena, such as overcharging and like-charge attraction. We also elucidate that the origin of the opposite-charge repulsion is the large amount of ions attracted to the double layer as a result of ion-ion correlations, leading to higher osmotic pressure and stronger screening of the electrostatic attraction, which results in an overall repulsive force between two oppositely charged surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is no causal relationship between opposite-charge repulsion and the overcharging of the surface. Opposite-charge repulsion is accompanied by overcharging at large separation distances, but can also occur in normal double layers without overcharging at intermediate separation distances.</description>

Abstract: There is an important difference between piezoelectric polymer films and solid crystals for the application to piezoelectric generators. In the case of polymers, the optimal piezoelectric response imposes {\it a large bending regime}. Starting from the linear Curie's constitutive equations, we develop an analytical model under the assumption of the large bending regime resulting from bulge testing configuration. This model shows a specific non-linear piezoelectric response, that follows a power $2/3$ of the mechanical excitation. The piezoelectric voltage and the corresponding power are then studied experimentally as a function of the angular frequency $\omega$ of the mechanical excitation, the load resistance $R$, and the thickness of the film $\ell$. The experimental results carried out on piezoelectric PVDF films validate the model.</description>

      <title>Tensegrity-Inspired Polymer Films: Progressive Bending Stiffness through Multipolymeric Patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials with J-shaped stress-strain behavior under uniaxial stretching, where strength increases as deformation progresses, have been developed through various materials designs. On the other hand, polymer materials that progressively stiffen under bending remain unrealized. To address this gap, this study drew inspiration from membrane tensegrity structures, which achieve structural stability by balancing compressive forces in rods and tensile forces in membrane. Notably, some of these structures exhibit increased stiffness under bending. Using a multipolymer patterning technique, we developed a polymer film exhibiting membrane tensegrity-like properties that stiffens under bending. This effect results from membrane tension generated by rod protrusions and an increase in second moment of area at regions with maximum curvature.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of random pinning, where we freeze the relaxation degrees of freedom for a fraction of randomly selected particles, on the yielding transition under oscillatory shear through extensive computer simulations. Using Kob-Anderson model as our model glass former, we pin a fraction of the particles. These pinned particles can move affinely under the imposed oscillatory shear deformation but are not allowed to relax through subsequent rearrangements due to plastic events. As the fraction of pinned particles increases, the system transitions from being a fragile glass former to a strong glass former. This gives us opportunity to examine how changes in fragility impact the yielding transition. Our results demonstrate notable differences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass formers under random pinning. This aligns with previous observations where fragility was altered by changing the packing fraction in soft sphere model albeit with a main difference that random pinning significantly suppresses the formation of shear bands, even in well-annealed glass samples.</description>

      <title>L\'evy distributed fluctuations in the living cell cortex</title>

Abstract: The actomyosin cortex is an active material that provides animal cells with a strong but flexible exterior, whose mechanics, including non-Gaussian fluctuations and occasional large displacements or cytoquakes, have defied explanation. We study the active fluctuations of the cortex using nanoscale tracking of arrays of flexible microposts adhered to multiple cultured cell types. When the confounding effects of static heterogeneity and tracking error are removed, the fluctuations are found to be heavy-tailed and well-described by a truncated L\'evy alpha-stable distribution over a wide range of timescales, in multiple cell types. The largest random displacements closely resemble the earlier-reported cytoquakes, but notably, we find these cytoquakes are not due to earthquake-like cooperative rearrangement of many cytoskeletal elements. Rather, they are indistinguishable from chance large excursions of a super-diffusive random process driven by heavy-tailed noise. The non-cooperative microscopic events driving these fluctuations need not be larger than the expected elastic energy of single tensed cortical actin filaments, and the implied distribution of microscopic event energies will need to be accounted for by future models of the cytoskeleton.</description>
