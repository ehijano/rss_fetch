      <title>Quantum Cosmology on Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With physical quantum computers becoming increasingly accessible, research on their applications across various fields has advanced rapidly. In this paper, we present the first study of quantum cosmology conducted on physical quantum computers, employing a newly proposed Hybrid Quantum-Classical (HQC) algorithm rather than the commonly used Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Specifically, we solve a constrained Hamiltonian equation derived by quantizing the Friedmann equation in cosmology. To solve this constraint equation, H |psi&gt; = 0, where H is a Hamiltonian operator and |psi&gt; = |psi(theta)&gt; is the wave function of phase angle theta describing the cosmic quantum state, we iteratively use the quantum computer to compute the eigenvalues of &lt;psi | H | psi&gt;, while a classical computer manages the underlying probability density function within the Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm (PBA) to update theta until the solution of &lt;psi | H | psi&gt; = 0 is achieved to a desired accuracy. Executing our algorithm on IBM's quantum computers, we attain a high-precision solution for theta, achieving approximately 1 percent error.</description>

      <title>Quantum dust collapse with cosmological constant and methods for constructing conformal diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The loop quantum gravitational collapse of the dust ball in presence of positive cosmological constant is investigated within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario. The dust ball interior is described within the framework of loop quantum cosmology, while its exterior geometry is determined by the differentiability of the spacetime metric at the dust ball surface and the assumption of the (vacuum) exterior to be stationary. In order to determine the global causal structure of the investigated spacetime a robust (numerical) method of constructing Penrose-Carter diagrams is built. Unfortunately the presence of cosmological constant does not cure the problems already present in the case of it vanishing -- the exterior geometry resembles that of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole, in particular featuring timelike singularties.</description>

      <title>A Linear Response Analysis of the Semiclassical Approximation to Spin 1/2 Quantum Electrodynamics in 1+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An investigation of the validity of the semiclassical approximation to quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions is given. The criterion for validity used here involves the impact of quantum fluctuations introduced through a two-point function which emerges naturally when considering the stability of the backreaction equation to linear order perturbations, resulting in the linear response equation. Consideration is given to the case of a spatially homogeneous electric field generated by a classical source, coupled to a quantized massive spin 1/2 field. Solutions to the linear response equation as well as the impact of quantum fluctuations introduced through the current density two-point correlation function are presented for two relevant electric field-to-mass parameter values $qE/m^2$, indicative of the strength of the backreaction process. Previous efforts utilized approximate solutions to the linear response equation that were expected to be valid for early times. A comparative analysis is given between the exact and approximate solutions in order to validate this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Event horizons under the effect of the Penrose process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how test particles absorbed by a black hole affect the properties of the event horizon. We consider particles that arrive from infinity with positive energy and cross the horizon. We also study the absorption of particles with negative energy, which are generated inside the ergosphere as the result of the decay of other particles, following the dynamics of the Penrose process. We show that, in general, the absorption process leads to an increase in the horizon radius and, consequently, of any physical quantity that is proportional to the horizon radius, such as the irreducible mass or the entropy.</description>

      <title>Mimetic Weyl geometric gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a mimetic type extension of the Weyl geometric gravity theory, by assuming that the metric of the space-time manifold can be parameterized in terms of a scalar field, called the mimetic field. The action of the model is obtained by starting from a conformally invariant gravitational action, constructed, in Weyl geometry, from the square of the Weyl scalar, the strength of the Weyl vector, and an effective matter term, respectively. after linearizing the action in the Weyl scalar by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, we include the mimetic field, constructed from the same auxiliary scalar field used to linearize the action, via a Lagrange multiplier. The conformal invariance of the action is maintained by imposing the trace condition on the effective matter energy-momentum tensor, built up from the ordinary matter Lagrangian, and some specific functions of the Weyl vector, and the scalar field, respectively, thus making the matter sector of the action conformally invariant. We investigate the cosmological implications of the Mimetic Weyl geometric gravity by considering the dynamics of an isotropic and homogeneous FRW Universe. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are derived, and their solutions are obtained numerically for a dust filled Universe. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered model with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, and with the results of the $\Lambda$CDM standard paradigm. Our results indicate that the present model give a good description of the observational data, and they reproduce almost exactly the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Hence, Mimetic Weyl geometric gravity can be considered a viable alternative to the standard approaches to cosmology, and to the gravitational phenomena.</description>

      <title>Extending Hamiltonian Formulation of Particle Motion in Perturbed Kerr Spacetime to various time parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian formulation with action-angle variables is very useful when considering the motion of particles undergoing a self-force reaction due to gravitational wave emission. Using the proper time as a parameter along the trajectory is considered to be appropriate when developing formal arguments, but these arguments can easily be extended to arguments with other time variables. The aim of this paper is to clarify the relations between the schemes with various parameterizations of the orbit.</description>

      <title>Causal structure of nonhomogeneous dust collapse in effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the causal structure for spherically symmetric dust collapse within effective loop quantum gravity. We develop a general strategy (working beyond the dynamical model of our consideration) for constructing double null coordinates, allowing the extraction of conformal diagrams within single coordinate charts. With the methods introduced, we confirm that the homogeneous Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario resembles the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like picture. For the nonhomogenous collapse scenario, we construct the conformal diagrams, subsequently, we study its relevant properties, in particular, dust particles' trajectories, apparent horizons and shell-crossing singularities. We conclude that a considerable region of spacetime cannot be probed by the model's dynamics because of the formation of the shell-crossings. We also address the problem of the possible (non)-existence of timelike singularity known from the homogeneous collapse scenario.</description>

      <title>Fiber Optics in Curved Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-mode fibers are used in fiber-optic gyroscopes to measure the Sagnac effect and are planned to be used in forthcoming experiments on the gravitationally induced phase shift in single photons. However, current theoretical models of such experiments are limited to ray-optics approximations or, if based on wave optics, to a restricted class of fiber alignments. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper develops a comprehensive perturbative scheme to solve for electromagnetic modes, i.e., monochromatic solutions to Maxwell's equations, of arbitrarily bent step-index fibers in general stationary space-times. This leads to transport equations for the electromagnetic phase and polarization that include the gravitational redshift, the Sagnac effect, a generalization of Rytov's law to curved space, a gravitational Faraday effect in the form of shift-induced gyrotropy, as well as inverse spin Hall effects caused by fiber bending, gravitational acceleration, and space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>Unexplored regions in teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity: Sign-changing dark energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity has shown considerable potential in addressing cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ discrepancies, we explore previously overlooked solution spaces within this framework that hold further promise. Specifically, we examine the case where the customary assumption of a strictly positive effective dark energy (DE) density -- natural in general relativity -- may not apply, offering new possibilities. Focusing on the exponential infrared model $f(T)=Te^{\beta T_0/T}$, where $T$ is the torsion scalar, we investigate cosmological solutions characterized by the constant $\beta$, which is controlled by the present-day matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m0}$. Ensuring consistency with CMB data, we find that the widely studied $\beta_{+}$ (positive exponent) case exhibits phantom behavior, while the previously overlooked $\beta_{-}$ (negative exponent) case -- sufficient to avoid instabilities or ghosts -- features a sign-changing DE density that transitions smoothly from negative to positive values at redshift $z_{\dagger} \sim 1.5$, consistent with recent approaches to alleviating cosmological tensions. Though the sign-changing DE density in the $f(T)$ model leads to a larger-than-expected enhancement, we further extend the analysis by incorporating a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. This extension, $f(T) \rightarrow f(T) + 2\Lambda$, broadens the solution space consistent with the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement while maintaining consistency with CMB power spectra. Additionally, it introduces richer phenomenological possibilities, including the potential moderation or cessation of cosmic acceleration at very low redshifts, aligning with recent observational analyses, such as those from DESI BAO data. Our findings also suggest that existing $f(T)$ cosmological models should be revisited in light of the novel theoretical insights presented here.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a nonlinear electromagnetic extension in AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational properties of a nonlinear electromagnetic extension of an AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Our study begins with an analysis of the metric function and horizon structure, followed by calculations of the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars and an evaluation of the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols. These calculations allow us to examine geodesics and their influence on the photon sphere, shadow formation, and bending angle. In the thermodynamic framework, we evaluate essential quantities, including the Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, Gibbs free energy, and Hawking radiation emission. We further investigate black hole evaporation by estimating the evaporation timescale as the black hole approaches its final state. Additionally, quasinormal modes for scalar and vector perturbations are computed using the WKB approximation to characterize oscillatory behavior of the system. Finally, a time-domain analysis is provided in order to examine the evolution of these perturbations.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects on warm chromoinflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a model of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson inflaton field coupled to a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field. This model naturally leads to a warm inflation scenario, where the inflationary dynamics is dominated by thermal dissipation. In this work, we consider a scenario where the inflaton, an axion-like field, is coupled to the $SU(2)$ gauge field, similar to chromoinflation models. Both the inflaton and the gauge field with a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value are coupled to a thermal radiation bath. We demonstrate that the presence of the thermal bath during warm chromoinflation induces a thermal plasma mass for the background gauge field. This thermal mass can significantly disrupt the dynamics of the background gauge field, thereby driving it to its trivial null solution.</description>

      <title>Imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. In the context of field theory, it is more appropriate to obtain the timelike entanglement entropy through the Wick rotation of the twist operators. It is found that, in certain special cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is related to the commutator of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. To evaluate these commutators, we employ the operator product expansion of the twist operators, revealing that the commutator is generally universal across most scenarios. However, in more general cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy proves to be more complex. We compute the commutator of the twist operators along with its higher-order temporal derivatives. Utilizing these results, we derive a modified formula for the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extend this formula to the case of strip subregion in higher dimensions. Our analysis shows that for the strip geometry, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is solely related to the commutators of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. The findings presented in this paper provide valuable insights into the imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy and its physical significance.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of $(2+1)d$ chiral anomaly in a graphene plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>

      <title>Future prospects for measuring 1PPN parameters using observations of S2 and S62 at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism offers an agnostic framework for evaluating theories of gravity that extend beyond General Relativity. Departures from General Relativity are represented by a set of dimensionless parameters that, at the first order in the expansion, reduce to $\beta$ and $\gamma$, which describe deviations in spatial curvature and non-linear superposition effects of gravity, respectively. We exploit future observations of stars at the Galactic Center, orbiting the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, to forecast the ability to constrain the first-order PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$. We have generated a mock catalog of astrometric and spectroscopic data for S2, based on the Schwarzschild metric, simulating observations over multiple orbital periods with the GRAVITY and SINFONI instruments. Our analysis includes the effects of relativistic orbital precession and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity gravitational redshift. Since future data for S2 can provide constraints only on a linear combination of the PPN parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ we also analyzed the impact of future observations of the gravitational lensing for stars that pass closer in the sky to Sgr A*, like the known star S62, which can potentially provide tight constraints on the parameter $\gamma$, that alone regulates the amplitude of the astrometric deviations due to lensing. When combining lensing observations for S62, and the precise orbital tracking of S2, one obtains independent constraints on both $\gamma$ (with a potential precision as good as $\sim 1\%$) and $\beta$ (with a corresponding precision of $\sim 2\%$), providing a precision test of General Relativity and its extensions.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations by JWST yield a large abundance of luminous galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$ compared to that expected in the CDM scenario based on extrapolations of the star formation efficiency measured at lower redshifts. While several astrophysical processes can be responsible for such observations, here we explore to what extent such an effect can be rooted in the assumed Dark Energy (DE) sector of the current cosmological model. This is motivated by recent results from different cosmological probes combined with the last data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which indicate a tension in the DE sector of the concordance ${\Lambda}$ CDM model. We have considered the effect of assuming a DE characterized by a negative {\Lambda} as the ground state of a quintessence field on the galaxy luminosity function (LF) at high redshifts. We find that such models naturally affect the galaxy UV luminosities in the redshift range $10 \lesssim z\lesssim 15$ needed to match the JWST observations, and with the value of ${\Omega}_{\Lambda}$=[-0.6,-0.3] remarkably consistent with that required by independent cosmological probes. A sharp prediction of such models is the steep decline of the abundance of bright galaxies in the redshift range $15 \lesssim z\lesssim 16$.</description>

Abstract: We present some addition theorems for spin-weighted spherical harmonics, generalizing previous results for scalar (spin-zero) spherical harmonics. These addition theorems involve sums over the azimuthal quantum number of products of two spin-weighted spherical harmonics at different points on the two-sphere, either (or both) of which are differentiated with respect to one of their arguments.</description>

      <title>Templated Anisotropic Analyses of the LISA Galactic Foreground</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will feature a prominent anisotropic astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave signal, arising from the tens of millions of unresolved mHz white dwarf binaries in the Milky Way: the Galactic foreground. While proper characterization of the Galactic foreground as a noise source will be crucial for every LISA science goal, it is extremely scientifically interesting in its own right, comprising -- along with $\sim10^4$ resolvable white dwarf binaries -- a complete sample of every mHz white dwarf binary in our Galaxy. We present a novel Bayesian analysis of the LISA Galactic foreground that directly treats its anisotropy via astrophysically-motivated templates, allowing for a direct connection between the observed time-modulation of the foreground amplitude and the underlying spatial distribution of the Milky Way. We validate the efficacy of this approach via simulated data and show that it is able to accurately recover the foreground spectrum in the presence of LISA instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of a supermassive black hole binary from its magnetically arrested circumbinary accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merging supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries will likely be surrounded by a circumbinary accretion disk. Close to merger, gravitational radiation-driven inspiral will happen on timescales faster than the effective viscous time at the disk cavity wall, leading to a decoupling of the inner binary dynamics from the surrounding gaseous environment. Here we perform the first simulation of this decoupling process from a magnetically arrested circumbinary accretion disk. In this regime, the central cavity is filled with very strong vertical magnetic flux, regulating accretion onto the binary. Our simulations identify three main stages of this process: (1) Large-scale magnetic flux loss prior to decoupling. (2) Rayleigh-Taylor-driven accretion streams onto the binary during and after decoupling, which can power magnetic tower-like outflows, resembling dual jets. (3) Post merger, the cavity wall becomes unstable and the magnetic flux trapped inside the cavity will get ejected in large coherent outbreak episodes with implications for potential multi-messenger transients to merging SMBH binaries.</description>

      <title>Binary Kerr black-hole scattering at 2PM from quantum higher-spin Compton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum higher-spin theory applied to Compton amplitudes has proven to be surprisingly useful for elucidating Kerr black hole dynamics. Here we apply the framework to compute scattering amplitudes and observables for a binary system of two rotating black holes, at second post-Minkowskian order, and to all orders in the spin-multipole expansion for certain quantities. Starting from the established three-point and conjectured Compton quantum amplitudes, the infinite-spin limit gives classical amplitudes that serves as building block that we feed into the unitarity method to construct the 2-to-2 one-loop amplitude. We give scalar box, vector box, and scalar triangle coefficients to all orders in spin, where the latter are expressed in terms of Bessel-like functions. Using the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, the classical 2PM impulse is computed, and in parallel we work out the scattering angle and eikonal phase. We give novel all-orders-in-spin formulae for certain contributions, and the remaining ones are given up to ${\cal O}(S^{11})$. Since Kerr 2PM dynamics beyond ${\cal O}(S^{\ge 5})$ is as of yet not completely settled, this work serves as a useful reference for future studies.</description>

Abstract: Do physical laws limit the speed of "all data processing systems, manmade as well as biological"? This question proposed and positively answered by H. J. Bremermann in 1962, should be corrected to make it compatible with Einstein's theory of gravity (aka General Relativity, or GR). As a result, the Bremermann's limit, proportional to mass M of any computer, Mc^2/h = ~ (M/gram)10^47 bits per second, should be replaced by the absolute limit (c^5/Gh)^1/2= ~ 10^43 bits per second, where the universal constants c, G, and h are the speed of light, the gravitational constant, and Planck's constant.</description>

      <title>Kerr-fully Diving into the Abyss: Analytic Solutions to Plunging Geodesics in Kerr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present closed-form solutions for plunging geodesics in the extended Kerr spacetime using Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. Our solutions directly solve for the dynamics of generic timelike plunges, we also specialise to the case of test particles plunging from a precessing innermost stable circular orbit (ISSO). We find these solutions in the form of elementary and Jacobi elliptic functions parameterized by Mino time. In particular, we demonstrate that solutions for the ISSO case can be determined almost entirely in terms of elementary functions, depending only on the spin parameter of the black hole and the radius of the ISSO. This extends recent work on the case of equatorial plunges from the innermost stable circular orbit. Furthermore, we introduce a new equation that characterizes the radial inflow from the ISSO to the horizon, taking into account the inclination. For ease of application, our results have been implemented in the KerrGeodesics package in the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories, which catches five degrees of freedom, are valuable for its implications to inflation problems, generation of primordial magnetic fields, new black hole (BH) and neutron star solutions, etc. In this paper, we derive conditions for the absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities of nontrivial BH solutions dressed with scalar hair against both odd- and even-parity perturbations on top of the static and spherically symmetric background in the most general $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories with second-order equations of motion. In addition to some general discussions, several typical concrete models are investigated. Specially, we show that the stability against even-parity perturbations is ensured outside the event horizon under certain constraints to these models. This is a crucial step to check the self-consistency of the theories and to shed light on the physically accessible models of such theories for future studies.</description>

Abstract: We construct a (quantum mechanically) modified model for the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario where the exterior of the collapsing dust ball is a Hayward black hole spacetime and the interior is a dust Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. This interior cosmology is entirely determined by the junction conditions with the exterior black hole. It turns out to be non-singular, displaying a power-law contraction which precedes a de Sitter phase or, reversely, a power-law expansion followed by a de Sitter era. We also analyse the global causal structure and the viability of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modifications to general relativity lead to effects in the spectrum of quasi-normal modes of black holes. In this paper, we develop a parametrized formalism to describe deviations from general relativity in the Teukolsky equation, which governs linear perturbations of spinning black holes. We do this by introducing a correction to the effective potential of the Teukolsky equation in the form of a $1/r$ expansion controlled by free parameters. The method assumes that a small deviation in the effective potential induces a small modification in the spectrum of modes and in the angular separation constants. We isolate and compute the universal linear contribution to the quasi-normal mode frequencies and separation constants in a set of coefficients, and test them against known examples in the literature (massive scalar field, Dudley-Finley equation and higher-derivative gravity). We make the coefficients publicly available for relevant overtone, angular momentum and azimuthal numbers of modes and different values of the black hole spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a rotating massive body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level in terms of the osculating Keplerian orbital elements. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit, and to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the C-metric in $2+1$ dimensions, placing it within a shell of stress energy and matching it to an exterior vacuum AdS metric. The $2+1$ C-metric is not circularly symmetric and hence neither are the constructed shells, which instead take on a cuspoidal or teardrop shape. We interpret the stress energy of the shells as a perfect fluid, calculating the energy density and pressure. For accelerating particles (Class I), we find the stress energy is concentrated on the part of shell farthest from the direction of acceleration and always respects the strong energy condition. For accelerating black holes (Class I$_{\mathrm{C}}$, II, and III), the shell stress energy may either respect or violate the energy conditions depending on the parameter of the exterior metric -- between the two regimes lies a critical value of the external parameter for which the shell stress energy vanishes, leading to new solutions of Einstein's field equations, which fall into three categories: an accelerated black hole pulled by a finite-length string with a point particle at the other end, an accelerated black hole pushed by a finite-length strut with a point particle at the other end, and an accelerated black hole pushed from one side by a finite-length strut and pulled from the other by a finite-length string, each with a point particle at the other end.</description>

Abstract: Finite real spectral triples are defined to characterise the non-commutative geometry of a fuzzy torus. The geometries are the non-commutative analogues of flat tori with moduli determined by integer parameters. Each of these geometries has four different Dirac operators, corresponding to the four unique spin structures on a torus. The spectrum of the Dirac operator is calculated. It is given by replacing integers with their quantum integer analogues in the spectrum of the corresponding commutative torus.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, with Drago and Pinamonti we have introduced a Wetterich-type flow equation for scalar fields on Lorentzian manifolds, using the algebraic approach to perturbative QFT. The equation governs the flow of the effective average action, under changes of a mass parameter k. Here we introduce an analogous flow equation for gauge theories, with the aid of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. We also show that the corresponding effective average action satisfies a Slavnov-Taylor identity in Zinn-Justin form. We interpret the equation as a cohomological constraint on the functional form of the effective average action, and we show that it is consistent with the flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the regime of cosmology and large-scale structure formation, filaments are vital components of the cosmic web. This study employs statistical methods to examine the formation, evolution, and cosmological constraints of filaments identified by DisPerSe. We run large-sample of N-body simulations to study the filament length and its evolution. In general, the filament length distribution can be fitted by a power law with both the normalization and power index dependent on redshift and cosmological parameters. It is discovered that filament length distribution is influenced by various cosmological parameters, with $\sigma_8$ and $n_s$ exhibiting slightly stronger dependence than $\Omega_m$. We also uncover a three-stage filament formation process from $z \sim 3$ to $z \sim 1$: rapid formation of both long and short filaments from $z \sim 3$ to $z \sim 2$, persistence of long filaments from $z \sim 2$ to $z \sim 1$, followed by fragmentation and increased prevalence of shorter filaments below $z \sim 1$. Finally, we employ initial power spectrum fluctuations to elucidate the cosmological dependence on the filament length function. These insights enhance our understanding of filament evolution and their cosmological relevance and also highlight the potential cosmological applications in observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The infrared problems of quantum electrodynamics, in contrast to ultraviolet difficulties which are of technical nature, are related to fundamental, conceptual physical questions, such as: what is a charged particle, is the particle interpretation of the electromagnetic field complete, does a vacuum state exist, or what is the quantum status of long range degrees of freedom. On the calculational level, the standard local formulations of quantum field theory have achieved procedures to deal with infinities related to long range correlations. However, the answers to the conceptual questions formulated above, based on the locality paradigm, do not seem to be fully convincing, which is confirmed by the fact that no canonical picture did emerge. This contribution briefly characterizes perspectives which open with an admission of nonlocal variables residing in infinity, or at the boundary of spacetime after compactification. Recently, this line of investigation gains popularity.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model is crucial for accurately predicting the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe in non-standard cosmologies. In this work, we present an analysis of the non-linear matter power spectrum within the framework of interacting dark energy-dark matter cosmologies (IDE). We employ N-body simulations and theoretical models to investigate the impact of IDE on these non-linear scales. Beginning with N-body simulations characterized by a fixed parameter space delineated by prior observational research, we adeptly fit the simulated spectra with a simple parametric function, achieving accuracy within 5\%. Subsequently, we refine a modified halo model tailored to the IDE cosmology, exhibiting exceptional precision in fitting the simulations down to scales of approximately 1 h/Mpc. To assess the model's robustness, we conduct a forecast analysis for the Euclid survey, employing our refined model. We find that the coupling parameter $\xi$ will be constrained to $\sigma(\xi) = 0.0110$. This marks a significant improvement by an order of magnitude compared to any other current observational tests documented in the literature. These primary findings pave the way for a novel preliminary approach, enabling the utilization of IDE models for observational constraints concerning LSS data on non-linear scales.</description>

      <title>Disentangling modified gravity from a dark force with gravitational redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to test for deviations from general relativity on cosmological scales is to combine measurements of the growth rate of structure with gravitational lensing. In this study, we show that this method suffers from an important limitation with regard to these two probes: models of dark matter with additional interactions can lead to the very same observational signatures found in modified gravity and vice versa. Using synthetic data of redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background, we demonstrate that this degeneracy is inevitable between modifications of gravity and a dark fifth force. We then show that the coming generation of surveys, in particular the Square Kilometre Array, will allow us to break the degeneracy between such models through measurements of gravitational redshift. Performing a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the synthetic dataset, we quantify the extent to which gravitational redshift can distinguish between two representative classes of models, generalized Brans-Dicke (modified gravity) and coupled quintessence (fifth force).</description>

      <title>Exploring the Orbital Alignments of Galactic Close White Dwarf Binaries with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the proposed space gravitational wave detector LISA, we will be able to measure the geometrical configurations of $\sim 10^4$ close white dwarf binaries in our Galaxy. The obtained data will be an entirely new resource to examine the randomness of their orbital orientations. Partly motivated by a recent reported on the systematic alignments of bulge planetary nebulae, we discuss the outlook of the orientational analysis with LISA. We find that a quadrupole pattern as small as $\sim 0.05$ can be detected for bulge white dwarf binaries, owing to their large available number. From such a pattern analysis, we might geometrically explore fossil records in our Galaxy billions of years ago.</description>

      <title>General relativistic viscous accretion flow around Konoplya-Zhidenko black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of accretion flows around the Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) black hole, which is proposed by deforming the Kerr metric with a single deformation parameter to test the no-hair theorem using gravitational wave observations. The dynamical equations describing the general relativistic viscous accreting flow are solved self-consistently to find the transonic accretion solutions in terms of global constants, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($\mathcal{L}$), viscosity parameter ($\alpha$), spin ($a_{k}$), and deformation parameter ($\eta_0$). We obtain five distinct types of accretion solutions (O, A, $\text{A}^{\prime}$, W, and I-types), and observe that those solutions are not unique but rather continue to exist for wide range of parameter spaces in the $\mathcal{L}-E$ plane. Furthermore, we find that the viscous accretion flows can harbor shock waves when the relativistic shock conditions are satisfied. Consequently, the shock-induced global accretion solutions are obtained, and the effect of $\eta_0$ on shock properties, such as shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$) and change in electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) across the shock front are investigated. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of accretion flow using the relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung emission coefficient and study the modification of SEDs due to the increase of $\eta_0$ for both shock-induced and shock-free solutions. In addition, it has been noticed that the observable quantities, like quasi-periodic oscillation frequency ($\nu_{\rm QPO}$) and bolometric disc luminosity ($L$), are strongly dependent on $\eta_0$. Finally, we phenomenologically show that the KZ black hole is consistent with the high-frequency QPOs, commonly observed in black hole binaries and black hole candidates.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: Infrared causality and detectability of GW observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate time delays of gravitational wave and scalar wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet effective field theories of gravity. By requiring infrared causality, we impose a lower bound on the cutoff scale of the theories. With this bound, we further discuss the detectability of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Comparing with the gravitational effective field theories that only contain the two tensor modes, adding a scalar degree of freedom opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity with purely virtual particles from asymptotically local quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the local limits of various classes of unitary, nonlocal quantum field theories. While it is easy to build nonlocal models with well-behaved asymptotics in Euclidean space, the Minkowskian correlation functions typically exhibit singular behaviors. We introduce "asymptotically local" quantum field theory (AL-QFT) as the class that encompasses unitary, nonlocal theories with well-defined local limits in Minkowski spacetime. The target models cannot propagate ghosts, but are allowed to contain purely virtual particles (PVPs). In the bubble diagram, the nonlocal deformation generates PVPs straightforwardly. In the triangle diagram, it does so possibly up to multi-threshold corrections, which may be adjusted by tuning the deformation itself. We build examples of AL-QFTs, including a deformation of quantum gravity with purely virtual particles. AL-QFT can serve various purposes, such as suggesting innovative approaches to off-shell physics, providing an alternative formulation for theories with PVPs, or smoothing out nonanalytic behaviors. We discuss its inherent arbitrariness and the implications for renormalizability.</description>
