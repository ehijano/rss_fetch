      <title>DBRAA: Sub-6 GHz and Millimeter Wave Dual-Band Reconfigurable Antenna Array for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a dual-band reconfigurable antenna array (DBRAA), enabling wireless capabilities in both sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands using a single array. For the sub-6G band, we propose a reconfigurable antenna selection structure, where each sub-6G antenna is formed by multiplexing several mmWave antennas, with its position dynamically adjusted using PIN diodes. For the mmWave band, we develop a reconfigurable hybrid beamforming structure that connects radio frequency chains to the antennas via phase shifters and a reconfigurable switch network. We then investigate integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in sub-6G and mmWave bands using the proposed DBRAA and formulate a dual-band ISAC beamforming design problem. This problem aims at maximizing the mmWave communication sum-rate subject to the constraints of sub-6G communication quality of service and sensing beamforming gain requirements. The dual-band ISAC beamforming design is decoupled into sub-6G beamforming design and mmWave beamforming design. For the sub-6G beamforming design, we develop a fast search-based joint beamforming and antenna selection algorithm. For the mmWave beamforming design, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers-based reconfigurable hybrid beamforming algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nonlinear Transform Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Correlated Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates distributed joint source-channel coding (JSCC) for correlated image semantic transmission over wireless channels. In this setup, correlated images at different transmitters are separately encoded and transmitted through dedicated channels for joint recovery at the receiver. We propose a novel distributed nonlinear transform source-channel coding (D-NTSCC) framework. Unlike existing learning-based approaches that implicitly learn source correlation in a purely data-driven manner, our method explicitly models the source correlation through joint distribution. Specifically, the correlated images are separately encoded into latent representations via an encoding transform function, followed by a JSCC encoder to produce channel input symbols. A learned joint entropy model is introduced to determine the transmission rates, which more accurately approximates the joint distribution of the latent representations and captures source dependencies, thereby improving rate-distortion performance. At the receiver, a JSCC decoder and a decoding transform function reconstruct the images from the received signals, each serving as side information for recovering the other image. Therein, a transformation module is designed to align the latent representations for maximal correlation learning. Furthermore, a loss function is derived to jointly optimize encoding, decoding, and the joint entropy model, ensuring that the learned joint entropy model approximates the true joint distribution. Experiments on multi-view datasets show that D-NTSCC outperforms state-of-the-art distributed schemes, demonstrating its effectiveness in exploiting source correlation.</description>

      <title>Age of Information in Short Packet Multi-Connectivity Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate multi-connectivity (MC) schemes in the context of status update systems with short payloads. As a performance metric, we use the age of information (AoI). Due to short payloads, transmission errors must be taken into account. In addition to the well-known schemes of packet duplication, message splitting, and multiplexing, we propose a codeword splitting scheme, where each status update is jointly encoded across multiple channels. We derive closed-form expressions of the average AoI for the different schemes and optimize their corresponding parameters, such as blocklengths, message splits, and the cyclic schedule for the multiplexing scheme. Analytical comparisons and numerical evaluations show that the codeword splitting scheme achieves the lowest average AoI when joint encoding and decoding are possible. In scenarios where joint encoding is not feasible, whether message splitting or multiplexing results in a lower average AoI depends on the specific parameters.</description>

      <title>Covert Entanglement Generation and Secrecy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the covert capacity for entanglement generation over a noisy quantum channel. While secrecy guarantees that the transmitted information remains inaccessible to an adversary, covert communication ensures that the transmission itself remains undetectable. The entanglement dimension follows a square root law (SRL) in the covert setting, i.e., $O(\sqrt{n})$ EPR pairs can be distributed covertly and reliably over n channel uses. We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation. Consequently, we establish achievability of the same covert entanglement generation rate as the classical information rate without secrecy, albeit with a larger key.</description>

      <title>On the Utility of Quantum Entanglement for Joint Communication and Instantaneous Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is known to significantly improve the performance (separately) of communication and detection schemes that utilize quantum resources. This work explores the simultaneous utility of quantum entanglement for (joint) communication and detection schemes, over channels that are convex combinations of identity, depolarization and erasure operators, both with perfect and imperfect entanglement assistance. The channel state is binary, rapidly time-varying and unknown to the transmitter. While the communication is delay-tolerant, allowing the use of arbitrarily long codewords to ensure reliable decoding, the channel state detection is required to be instantaneous. The detector is neither co-located with the transmitter, nor able to wait for the decoding in order to learn the transmitted waveform. The results of this work appear in the form of communication-rate vs instantaneous-detection-error tradeoffs, with and without quantum entanglement. Despite the challenges that place the two tasks at odds with each other, the results indicate that quantum entanglement can indeed be simultaneously and significantly beneficial for joint communication and instantaneous detection.</description>

      <title>Robust DNN Partitioning and Resource Allocation Under Uncertain Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In edge intelligence systems, deep neural network (DNN) partitioning and data offloading can provide real-time task inference for resource-constrained mobile devices. However, the inference time of DNNs is typically uncertain and cannot be precisely determined in advance, presenting significant challenges in ensuring timely task processing within deadlines. To address the uncertain inference time, we propose a robust optimization scheme to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile devices while meeting task probabilistic deadlines. The scheme only requires the mean and variance information of the inference time, without any prediction methods or distribution functions. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that involves jointly optimizing the DNN model partitioning and the allocation of local CPU/GPU frequencies and uplink bandwidth. To tackle the problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and DNN model partitioning. Subsequently, the two subproblems with probability constraints are equivalently transformed into deterministic optimization problems using the chance-constrained programming (CCP) method. Finally, the convex optimization technique and the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) technique are employed to obtain the optimal solution of the resource allocation subproblem and a stationary point of the DNN model partitioning subproblem, respectively. The proposed algorithm leverages real-world data from popular hardware platforms and is evaluated on widely used DNN models. Extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inference time uncertainty with probabilistic deadline guarantees while minimizing the energy consumption of mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum umlaut information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum umlaut information, a correlation measure defined for bipartite quantum states $\rho_{AB}$ as a reversed variant of the quantum mutual information: $U(A;B)_\rho = \min_{\sigma_B} D(\rho_A\otimes \sigma_B\|\rho_{AB})$ in terms of the quantum relative entropy $D$. As in the classical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a closed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic error exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given bipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to quantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information' [Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is additive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations for fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory, we then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information constitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information transmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which quantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation applies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the channel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding expression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the classical-quantum case [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 59, 8027 (2013)]. Combined with prior works on non-signalling--assisted zero-error channel capacities, our findings imply a dichotomy between the settings of zero-rate error exponents and zero-error communication. While our results are single-letter only for classical-quantum channels, we also give a single-letter bound for fully quantum channels in terms of the `geometric' version of umlaut information.</description>

      <title>Deterministic identification over channels with finite output: a dimensional perspective on superlinear rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09117v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following initial work by JaJa, Ahlswede and Cai, and inspired by a recent renewed surge in interest in deterministic identification (DI) via noisy channels, we consider the problem in its generality for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. Such a channel is essentially given by its output distributions as a subset in the probability simplex. Our main findings are that the maximum length of messages thus identifiable scales superlinearly as $R\,n\log n$ with the block length $n$, and that the optimal rate $R$ is bounded in terms of the covering (aka Minkowski, or Kolmogorov, or entropy) dimension $d$ of a certain algebraic transformation of the output set: $\frac14 d \leq R \leq \frac12 d$. Remarkably, both the lower and upper Minkowski dimensions play a role in this result. Along the way, we present a "Hypothesis Testing Lemma" showing that it is sufficient to ensure pairwise reliable distinguishability of the output distributions to construct a DI code. Although we do not know the exact capacity formula, we can conclude that the DI capacity exhibits superactivation: there exist channels whose capacities individually are zero, but whose product has positive capacity. We also generalise these results to classical-quantum channels with finite-dimensional output quantum system, in particular to quantum channels on finite-dimensional quantum systems under the constraint that the identification code can only use tensor product inputs.</description>

      <title>Sequential Outlier Hypothesis Testing under Universality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14221v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit sequential outlier hypothesis testing and derive bounds on achievable exponents when both the nominal and anomalous distributions are \emph{unknown}. The task of outlier hypothesis testing is to identify the set of outliers that are generated from an anomalous distribution among all observed sequences where the rest majority are generated from a nominal distribution. In the sequential setting, one obtains a sample from each sequence per unit time until a reliable decision could be made. For the case with exactly one outlier, our exponent bounds on are tight, providing exact large deviations characterization of sequential tests and strengthening a previous result of Li, Nitinawarat and Veeravalli (2017). In particular, the average sample size of our sequential test is bounded universally under any pair of nominal and anomalous distributions and our sequential test achieves larger Bayesian exponent than the fixed-length test, which could not be guaranteed by the sequential test of Li, Nitinawarat and Veeravalli (2017). For the case with at most one outlier, we propose a threshold-based test that has bounded expected stopping time under mild conditions and we bound the error exponents under each non-null and the null hypotheses. Our sequential test resolves the error exponents tradeoff for the fixed-length test of Zhou, Wei and Hero (TIT 2022). Finally, with a further step towards practical applications, we generalize our results to the cases of multiple outliers and show that there is a penalty in the error exponents when the number of outliers is unknown.</description>

      <title>Rate-reliability functions for deterministic identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate deterministic identification over arbitrary memoryless channels under the constraint that the error probabilities of first and second kind are exponentially small in the block length $n$, controlled by reliability exponents $E_1,E_2 \geq 0$. In contrast to the regime of slowly vanishing errors, where the identifiable message length scales as $\Theta(n\log n)$, here we find that for positive exponents linear scaling is restored, now with a rate that is a function of the reliability exponents. We give upper and lower bounds on the ensuing rate-reliability function in terms of (the logarithm of) the packing and covering numbers of the channel output set, which for small error exponents $E_1,E_2&gt;0$ can be expanded in leading order as the product of the Minkowski dimension of a certain parametrisation the channel output set and $\log\min\{E_1,E_2\}$. These allow us to recover the previously observed slightly superlinear identification rates, and offer a different perspective for understanding them in more traditional information theory terms. We further illustrate our results with a discussion of the case of dimension zero, and extend them to classical-quantum channels and quantum channels with tensor product input restriction.</description>

      <title>Power Minimization for NOMA-assisted Pinching Antenna Systems With Multiple Waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of pinching antenna systems with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as a promising technique for future 6G applications. This paper is the first to investigate power minimization for NOMA-assisted pinching antenna systems utilizing multiple dielectric waveguides. We formulate a total power minimization problem constrained by each user's minimum data requirements, addressing a classical challenge. To efficiently solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interference function of this algorithm is standard, ensuring convergence to a unique fixed point. Numerical simulations validate that our developed algorithm converges within a few steps and significantly outperforms benchmark strategies across various data rate requirements. The results also indicate that the minimum transmit power, as a function of the interval between the waveguides, exhibits an approximately oscillatory decay with a negative trend.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>
