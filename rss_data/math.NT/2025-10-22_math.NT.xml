      <title>On the Bernoulli--Hurwitz periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve having CM by the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field $K$ in which $p$ splits. Following Lichtenbaum, the Bernoulli--Hurwitz numbers of $E$ (i.e., values of Eisenstein series evaluated at $E$ up to normalization) admit integral representations given by a $p$-adic measure constructed from an elliptic function. We show that the periods of this measure are in fact special values of a family of weight one Eisenstein series at the CM curve $E$ equipped with certain level data, and explicitly relate it to Katz's one-variable $p$-adic Eisenstein measure, whereby we derive period formulas of the Bernoulli--Hurwitz measure attached to any ordinary elliptic curve $\mathcal{E}$ defined over a local field. Moreover, by exploiting the modularity of these periods, and thanks to the existence of abundant weight one Hasse-type invariants, we present a novel approach to the interpolation property of the Bernoulli--Hurwitz $p$-adic zeta functions of the ordinary elliptic curve $\mathcal{E}$, and obtain a $p$-adic Kronecker's first limit formula.</description>

      <title>Roth's Theorem in Super Smooth Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that the set of $y$-smooth numbers $\mathcal{S}(N,y)$ up to $N$ is super smooth if $y=\log^KN$ for a large fixed constant $K$. We show that the Roth's theorem on arithmetic progressions is true in super smooth numbers case. This extends the result of Harper where he showed the statement is true under a weaker hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The second moment of $\mathrm{GL}(2)\times \mathrm{GL}(2)$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions in the level aspect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula with a power-saving error term for a specific weighted second moment of $\mathrm{GL}(2)\times \mathrm{GL}(2)$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-function, $L(1/2,\pi\otimes \pi_0)$ over any number field $F$ where $\pi$ runs over representations with the non-archimedean conductor dividing an ideal which tends to infinity and $\pi_0$ is a fixed cuspidal representation unramified everywhere. The error term shows the square root cancellation under the assumption of the Generalised Ramanujan Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Stability of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and $E/K$ an elliptic curve over $K$. For a finite extension $L/K$ and a prime~$\ell$, we provide Galois-theoretic sufficient conditions on $L/K$ under which $E\left(L\right)\left[\ell^{\infty}\right] = E\left(K\right)\left[\ell^{\infty}\right]$. For a non-Galois extension $L/K$ of prime degree, we relate the growth of the $\ell^{\infty}$-torsion subgroup of $E$ under the base change $L/K$ to the image of the mod-$\ell$ cyclotomic character. In particular, we refine Najman's result by ruling out certain torsion structures for cubic non-Galois extensions $L/\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>A quantitative framework for sets of exact approximation order by rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a quantitative notion of exactness within Diophantine approximation. Given $\Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ and $\omega:(0,\infty)\to (0,1)$ satisfying $\lim_{q\to\infty}\omega(q)=0$, we study the set of points, which we call $E(\Psi,\omega)$, that are $\Psi$-well approximable but not $\Psi(1-\omega)$-well approximable. We prove results on the cardinality and dimension of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. In particular we obtain the following general statements: (i) For any $\omega:(0,\infty)\to (0,1)$ and $\tau&gt;2$ there exists $\Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ such that $\lim_{q\to\infty}\frac{-\log \Psi(q)}{\log q}=\tau$ and $E(\Psi,\omega)\neq\emptyset.$ (ii) Under natural monotonicity assumptions on $\Psi$ and $\omega,$ we prove that if $\omega$ decays to zero sufficiently slowly (in a way that depends upon $\Psi$) then $E(\Psi,\omega)$ is uncountable. Moreover, under further natural assumptions on $\Psi$ we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension of $E(\Psi,\omega)$.
  Our main result demonstrates a new threshold for the behaviour of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. A particular instance of this threshold is illustrated by considering functions of the form $\Psi_{\tau}(q)=q^{-\tau}$ when $\tau\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 3}$. For these functions we prove the following: (iii) If $\omega(q)= Cq^{-\tau(\tau-1)}$ for some sufficiently large $C$ or $\omega(q)=q^{-\tau'}$ for some $\tau'&lt;\tau(\tau-1),$ then $E(\Psi_{\tau},\omega)$ is uncountable and we calculate its Hausdorff dimension. (iv) If $\omega(q)&lt; cq^{-\tau(\tau-1)}$ for some $c\in (0,1)$ for all $q$ sufficiently large then $E(\Psi_{\tau},\omega)=\emptyset.$</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish lower bounds for the maximum of derivatives of the Riemann zeta function on vertical homogeneous progressions. When the real part $\sigma$ lies within a suitable range, we show that the discrete case has a similar order of magnitude to the continuous case, using the resonance method.</description>

      <title>The Minimal Binomial Multiples of Polynomials over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(X)$ be a nonconstant polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, with a nonzero constant term. The order of $f(X)$ is a classical notion in the theory of polynomials over finite fields, and recently the definition of freeness of binomials of $f(X)$ was given in \cite{Mart\'{i}nez}. Generalizing these two notions, we introduce the definition of the minimal binomial multiple of $f(X)$ in this paper, which is the monic binomial with the lowest degree among the binomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ divided by $f(X)$. Based on the equivalent characterization of binomials via the defining sets of their radicals, we prove that a series of properties of the classical order can be naturally generalized to this case. In particular, the minimal binomial multiple of $f(X)$ is presented explicitly in terms of the defining set of the radical of $f(X)$. And a criterion for $f(X)$ being free of binomials is given. As an application, for any positive integer $N$ and nonzero element $\lambda$ in $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, the $\lambda$-constacyclic codes of length $N$ with minimal distance $2$ are determined.</description>

      <title>Undecidability on Diophantine equations over $\mathbb Z[i]$ with $20$ unknowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that Hilbert's Tenth Problem over the Gaussian ring $\mathbb Z[i]=\{a+bi:\ a,b\in\mathbb Z\}$ is undecidable. In this paper we obtain the following further result: There is no algorithm to decide whether an arbitrarily given polynomial equation $P(z_1,\ldots,z_{20})=0$ (with integer coefficients) is solvable over $\mathbb Z[i]$. This improves the previous record involving $52$ variables.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility and Galois groups of random reciprocal polynomials of large degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A = a_0T^m + \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} a_j (T^{m-j}+T^{m+j}) + T^{2m}+1 \in \mathbf{Z}[T]$ be a monic reciprocal polynomial of degree $2m$ sampled randomly by selecting its coefficients $a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{m-1}$ independently according to a given probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbf{Z}$. For a wide range of measures $\mu$, we prove that $A$ is irreducible with probability $\ge 1-Cm^{-c}$ for some absolute constants $c,C&gt;0$. In addition, we prove that with the same probability the Galois group of $A$ is either the full hyperoctahedral group $\mathcal{C}_2 \wr \mathcal{S}_m$ or one of two of its index-$2$ subgroups. The main condition that $\mu$ must satisfy is of Fourier-theoretic nature, and holds for example when $\mu$ is the uniform measure on a set of at least $35$ consecutive integers, or on an arbitrary, sufficiently large subset of an interval $[-H,H]$, with $H$ larger than some absolute constant. Our most general result allows for each $a_j$ to be sampled by its own probability measure $\mu_j$.
  Our approach builds on earlier work of Bary-Soroker, Kozma and the second author, who proved for essentially the same $\mu_j$ that the 'standard' monic polynomial $a_0 + \cdots + a_{m-1}T^{m-1} + T^m$ is irreducible and has as Galois group either the symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_m$ or the alternating group $\mathcal{A}_m$ with high probability, conditioning on $a_0 \neq 0$. In our setting of reciprocal polynomials, we can rule out (all subgroups of) the maximal alternating subgroup $(\mathcal{C}_2 \wr \mathcal{S}_m) \cap \mathcal{A}_{2m}$ of the hyperoctahedral group as likely Galois group of $A$ by analyzing its discriminant.</description>

      <title>Beurling Nyman Geometry and Gram Matrix Structure, Ladder Density and Polynomial Decay via Mellin Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Beurling Nyman (BN) family $f_\theta(x) = \{\theta/x\} - \theta\{1/x\}$ in $L^2((0,1])$ through a multiscale ladder parameterisation $\theta_{j,k} = 2^{-j}3^{-k}$ and the associated Gram matrix structure indexed by ladder distance. Using Mellin analysis and a controlled smoothing operator, we establish a rigorous polynomial decay envelope for off-diagonal Gram entries. Specifically, for a Gaussian-type Mellin multiplier we prove that $$|\langle g_{\theta_{j,k}}, g_{\theta_{j',k'}} \rangle| \ll_m \bigl(1 + c d((j,k),(j',k'))\bigr)^{-m}$$ for any $m$ in $\mathbb{N}$, where $c = \min\{\log 2, \log 3\}$ and $d$ denotes the ladder distance. As a consequence we obtain block-compressibility of Gram rows for $m &gt; 2$. These results provide a rigorous foundation for sparsity phenomena in the BN system and support constructive spectral approaches. The analysis is unconditional and independent of any hypothesis concerning the zeros of the zeta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the question of effectivity for calculation of local Weil functions from the viewpoint of presentations of Cartier divisors. This builds on the approach of Bombieri and Gubler as well as the perspective of our earlier works. Among other features, our approach here gives rise to theoretical effective algorithms for calculating local Weil functions on projective varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short note studies the asymptotic behavior of a generating function associated with the decimal expansion of \(2^n\). Our aims are twofold: (i) to present a problem on the best possible upper bound for this behavior, and (ii) to introduce a matrix representation that is useful for its analysis. The representation corresponds to a finite-state transfer operator; analytic and dynamical aspects are not pursued here.</description>

      <title>A Degree Bound for the c-Boomerang Uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field, and let $F \in \mathbb{F}_q [X]$ be a polynomial with $d = \text{deg} \left( F \right)$ such that $\gcd \left( d, q \right) = 1$. In this paper we prove that the $c$-Boomerang uniformity, $c \neq 0$, of $F$ is bounded by
  - $d^2$ if $c^2 \neq 1$,
  - $d \cdot (d - 1)$ if $c = -1$,
  - $d \cdot (d - 2)$ if $c = 1$.
  For all cases of $c$, we present tight examples for $F \in \mathbb{F}_q [X]$.
  Additionally, for the proof of $c = 1$ we establish that the bivariate polynomial $F (x) - F (y) + a \in k [x, y]$, where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p$ and $a \in k \setminus \{ 0 \}$, is absolutely irreducible if $p \nmid \text{deg} \left( F \right)$.</description>

This integral describes the evolution of a wave function $\Psi(x)$, which is defined as a map from a domain in $\mathbb{C}_{p}$ to $\mathbb{C}_{p}$. We also compute the Feynman propagator for free particles, demonstrating that the result obtained is similar to the classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>On density analogs of Hindman's finite sums theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density, we show the existence of an infinite set $B$ and sequences $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}, (s_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B + s_k, 1 \leq |F| \leq k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. This strengthens the density finite sums theorem of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson. We further show, given such a set $A$, the existence of an infinite set $B$ and a sequence $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B, |F| = k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. As a corollary, we obtain a sequence $(B_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite sets of natural numbers such that $B_1+\cdots +B_k \subset A$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We also establish the optimality of our main theorems by providing counterexamples to potential further generalizations, and thereby addressing questions of the aforementioned authors in the context of density analogs to Hindman's finite sums theorem.</description>

Abstract: We determine the asymptotic quantum variance of microlocal lifts of Hecke--Maass cusp forms on the arithmetic compact hyperbolic surfaces attached to maximal orders in quaternion algebras. Our result extends those of Luo--Sarnak--Zhao concerning the non-compact modular surface. The results of this article's prequel (which involved the theta correspondence, Rallis inner product formula and equidistribution of translates of elementary theta functions) reduce the present task to some local problems over the reals involving the construction and analysis of microlocal lifts via integral operators on the group. We address these here using an analytic incarnation of the method of coadjoint orbits.</description>

      <title>Two-Torsion Subgroups of some Modular Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a practical method to compute the 2-torsion subgroup of the Jacobian of a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus $3$, $4$ or $5$. The method is based on the correspondence between the 2-torsion subgroup and the theta hyperplanes to the curve. The correspondence is used to explicitly write down a zero-dimensional scheme whose points correspond to elements of the $2$-torsion subgroup. Using $p$-adic or complex approximations (obtained via Hensel lifting or homotopy continuation and Newton-Raphson) and lattice reduction we are then able to determine the points of our zero-dimensional scheme and hence the $2$-torsion points. We demonstrate the practicality of our method by computing the $2$-torsion of the modular Jacobians $J_{0}\left( N \right)$ for $N = 42, 55, 63, 72, 75$. As a result of this we are able to verify the generalised Ogg conjecture for these values.</description>

      <title>Are the Collatz and abc conjectures related?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Collatz and $abc$ conjectures, both well known and thoroughly studied, appear to be largely unrelated at first sight. We show that assuming the $abc$ conjecture true is helpful to improve the lower bound of integers initiating a particular type of Collatz sequences, namely finite sequences of a given length where all terms but one are odd with the usual ``shortcut'' form. To obtain sharper bounds in this context, we are led to consider a small subset of the $abc$-hits. Then, it turns out that Collatz iterations as well as Wieferich primes may be used to find large triples in this subset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conjecture due to Bertrand and Rodriguez Villegas asserts that the 1-norm of the nonzero element in an exterior power of the units of a number field has a certain lower bound. For the exterior square case of totally real quartic extensions of the rationals, Costa and Friedman gave a lower bound of 0.802. We prove that the bound can be improved to 1.134 when the extension is further assumed to be Galois.</description>

      <title>Zero-density estimates and the optimality of the error term in the prime number theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the impact of a generic zero-free region and zero-density estimate on the error term in the prime number theorem. Consequently, we are able to improve upon previous work of Pintz and provide an essentially optimal error term for some choices of the zero-free region. As an example, we show that if there are no zeros $\rho=\beta+it$ of $\zeta(s)$ with
  \begin{equation*}
  1-\beta&lt;\frac{1}{c(\log t)^{2/3}(\log\log t)^{1/3}}=:\eta(t),
  \end{equation*}
  then
  \begin{equation*}
  \frac{|\psi(x)-x|}{x}\ll\exp(-\omega(x))\frac{(\log x)^9}{(\log\log x)^3},
  \end{equation*}
  where $\psi(x)$ is the Chebyshev prime-counting function, and
  \begin{equation*}
  \omega(x)=\min_{t\geq 3}\{\eta(t)\log x+\log t\}.
  \end{equation*}
  This refines the best known error term for the prime number theorem, previously given by
  \begin{equation*}
  \frac{|\psi(x)-x|}{x}\ll_{\varepsilon}\exp(-(1-\varepsilon)\omega(x))
  \end{equation*}
  for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Gross lattices of supersingular elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, $E$ be a supersingular elliptic curve defined over $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p$, and $\mathscr{O}$ be its (geometric) endomorphism ring. Earlier results of Chevyrev-Galbraith and Goren-Love have shown that the successive minima of the Gross lattice of $\mathscr{O}$ characterize the isomorphism class of $\mathscr{O}$. In this paper, we refine and extend this work and show that the value of the third successive minimum $D_3$ of the Gross lattice gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the curve to have its $j$-invariant in the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ or in the set $\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \setminus \mathbb{F}_p$, as well as finer information about the endomorphism ring of $E$ when its $j$-invariant belongs to $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. Finally, in the case where $j(E)$ belongs to $\mathbb{F}_p$, we define a new invariant of the Gross lattice, the Gram matrix of a normalized successive minimal basis, and develop an algorithm to compute it explicitly given the value of the first successive minimum of the Gross lattice.</description>

      <title>Murmurations for elliptic curves ordered by height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: He, Lee, Oliver, and Pozdnyakov~\cite{HLOP} have empirically observed that the average of the $p$th coefficients of the $L$-functions of elliptic curves of particular ranks in a given range of conductors $N$ appears to approximate a continuous function of $p$, depending primarily on the parity of the rank. Hence the sum of $p$th coefficients against the root number also appears to approximate a continuous function, dubbed the murmuration density. However, it is not clear from this numerical data how to obtain an explicit formula for the murmuration density. Convergence of similar averages was proved by Zubrilina~\cite{Zubrilina} for modular forms of weight $2$ (of which elliptic curves form a thin subset) and analogous results for other families of automorphic forms have been obtained in further work~\cite{BBLLD,LOP}. Each of these works gives an explicit formula for the murmuration density. We consider a variant problem where the elliptic curves are ordered by naive height, and the $p$th coefficients are averaged over $p/N$ in a fixed interval. We give a conjecture for the murmuration density in this case, as an explicit but complicated sum of Bessel functions. This conjecture is motivated by a theorem about a variant problem where we sum the $n$th coefficients for $n$ with no small prime factors against a smooth weight function. We test this conjecture for elliptic curves of naive height up to $2^{28}$ and find good agreement with the data. The theorem is proved using the Voronoi summation formula, and the method should apply to many different families of $L$-functions. By a similar approach, we give a prediction murmuration density for elliptic curves of prime conductor, ordered by conductor, again matching the data but lacking a motivating theorem. This is the first work to give an explicit formula for the murmuration density of a family of elliptic curves, in any ordering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended Riemann hypothesis (ERH) for Dedekind zeta functions remains one of the most elusive open problems in number theory. Over the last century, many equivalent statements to the classical Riemann hypothesis alone have been discovered. We prove that the closed form of some infinite series over the non-trivial zeros of Dedekind zeta functions holds if and only if ERH is true.</description>

Abstract: We study Dirichlet series arising as linear functionals on an inner product space of meromorphic functions and establish a relation between the discontinuities of the former on the boundary and the poles and zeros of the latter on the imaginary axis. As an example application of Delange's Tauberian theorem, it is shown that the conjectured asymptotic in the additive divisor problem follows conditionally on the non-vanishing of certain meromorphic functions on the imaginary axis.</description>

Abstract: Given a finite abelian group $G$ and a subset $J\subset G$ with $0\in J$, let $D_{G}(J,N)$ be the maximum size of $A\subset G^{N}$ such that the difference set $A-A$ and $J^{N}$ have no non-trivial intersection. Recently, this extremal problem has been widely studied for different groups $G$ and subsets $J$. In this paper, we generalize and improve the relevant results by Alon and by Heged\H{u}s by building a bridge between this problem and cyclotomic polynomials with the help of algebraic graph theory. In particular, we construct infinitely many non-trivial families of $G$ and $J$ for which the current known upper bounds on $D_{G}(J, N)$ can be improved exponentially.</description>

      <title>A shrinking target problem in homogeneous spaces of semisimple algebraic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a shrinking target problem with target at infinity in a homogeneous space of a semisimple algebraic group from the representation-theoretic point of view. Let $\rho:\mathbf G\to\mathbf{GL}(V)$ be an irreducible $\mathbb Q$-rational representation of a connected semisimple $\mathbb Q$-algebraic group $\mathbf G$ on a complex vector space $V$, $\{a_t\}_{t\in\mathbb R}$ a one-parameter subgroup in a $\mathbb Q$-split torus in $\mathbf G$ and $\psi:\mathbb R_+\to\mathbb R_+$ a positive function on $\mathbb R_+$. We define a subset $S_\rho(\psi)$ of $\psi$-Diophantine elements in $\mathbf G(\mathbb R)$ in terms of the representation $\rho$ and $\{a_t\}_{t\in\mathbb R}$, and prove formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of the complement of $S_{\rho}(\psi)$. We also discuss the connections of our results to Diophantine approximation on flag varieties and rational approximation to linear subspaces in Grassmann varieties.</description>

      <title>On sets with missing differences in compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A much-studied problem posed by Motzkin asks to determine, given a finite set $D$ of integers, the so-called Motzkin density for $D$, i.e., the supremum of upper densities of sets of integers whose difference set avoids $D$. We study the natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using ergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following discrete problem: given a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be the image in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the Motzkin density for $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$. We study in particular the periodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand, we prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case rank$(\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the case rank$(\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\leq 3$. It follows that, for up to three missing differences, the Motzkin density in a compact abelian group is always a rational number.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>
