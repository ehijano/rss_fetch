      <title>Timelike conformal fields on closed $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates timelike conformal vector fields on closed Lorentzian $3$-manifolds and shows that, although these fields form a broader class than Killing fields, their behavior in dimension three is nonetheless remarkably rigid. After performing a conformal change of the metric so that the vector field becomes unit and Killing, we analyze the geometry of the flow it generates through the framework of stable Hamiltonian structures and basic cohomology. Our main result proves that any nowhere-vanishing timelike conformal vector field necessarily arises as the Reeb vector field of either a Sasakian structure or a co-K\"ahler structure. In other words, every such Lorentzian conformal flow is intrinsically "Reeb-like", which forces the underlying geometry to be either contact or cosymplectic. This establishes a striking connection between Lorentzian geometry, Sasakian and co-K\"ahler structures, and the topology of flows in dimension~$3$.</description>

      <title>Completeness of closed Kleinian flat Pseudo-Riemannian Manifolds of Signature (2,2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ denote the model space of flat pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature $(2,2)$. We prove that the only domain divisible by a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ is $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ itself. In the Kleinian setting, this provides the first completeness theorem of closed flat pseudo-Riemannian manifolds beyond the Euclidean and Lorentzian cases.
  Along the proof, we show two results of independent interest. The first is a geometric reduction for certain divisible domains of affine space. The second concerns the existence of syndetic hulls in semidirect products $R \ltimes G$, where $G$ is a homothety Lie group. This construction generalizes earlier constructions in affine geometry due to Carri\`ere and Dal'bo.</description>

      <title>Natural parallel translation and connection associated to navigation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the geometric setting of navigation data and introduce a natural parallel translation using the Riemannian parallelism. The geometry obtained in this way has some nice and natural features: the natural parallel translation is homogeneous (but in general nonlinear), preserves the Randers type Finslerian norm constituted by the navigation data, and the holonomy group is finite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the asymptotic limits for Ricci-flat manifolds with linear volume growth II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate the uniqueness of asymptotic limits for noncollapsed Ricci flat manifolds with linear volume growth to the existence of a harmonic function asymptotic to a Busemann function.
  Parallel to the work of Colding--Minicozzi in the Euclidean volume growth setting, we prove uniqueness of the asymptotic limit and establish a quantitative polynomial convergence rate via a monotone quantity associated with this harmonic function, assuming such harmonic function exists and one asymptotic limit is smooth.
  Conversely, for an open manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature, we show that uniqueness of the asymptotic limit implies the existence of the desired harmonic function, without assuming smoothness of the cross section.</description>

      <title>An enumerative min-max theorem for minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an enumerative min-max theorem that relates the number of genus g minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds of positive Ricci curvature to topological properties of the set of embedded surfaces of genus $\leq g$, possibly with finitely many singularities. This completes a central component of our program of using topological methods to enumerating minimal surfaces with prescribed genus.
  As an application, we show that every 3-sphere of positive Ricci curvature contains at least 4 embedded minimal surfaces of genus 2.</description>

      <title>Obata-Type Rigidity on Static Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate static metrics on simple manifolds with compact boundary and establish an Obata-type rigidity theorem. We identify new sufficient geometric conditions under which the combined curvature map $g\mapsto (R_g, H_g)$ is a local surjection. Consequently, we demonstrate that in contrast to manifolds without boundary, where staticity obstructs deformability, the scalar curvature map can be locally surjective at static metrics on manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear equation $\Delta_pv+av^q=0$ on manifolds with integral bounded Ricci curvature and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonexistence and gradient estimate for solutions to $\Delta_pv +av^{q}=0$ defined on a complete Riemannian manifold with {\it $\chi$-type Sobolev inequality}. A Liouville theorem on this equation is established if the lying manifold $(M, g)$ supports a {\it $\chi$-type Sobolev inequality} and the $L^{\frac{\chi}{\chi-1}}$ norm of $\ric_-(x)$ of $(M, g)$ is bounded from upper by some constant depending on $\dim(M)$, Sobolev constant $\mathbb{S}_\chi(M)$ and volume growth order of geodesic ball $B_r\subset M$. This extends and improves some conclusions obtained recently by Ciraolo, Farina and Polvara \cite{CFP}, but our method employed in this paper is different from their ``P-function" method. In particular, for such manifold with a {\it $\chi$-type Sobolev inequality}, we give the lower estimate of volume growth of geodesic ball. If $\chi\leq n/(n-2)$, we also establish the local logarithm gradient estimate for positive solutions to this equation under the condition $\ric_-(x)$ is $L^\gamma$-integrable where $\gamma&gt;{\frac{\chi}{\chi-1}}$.
  As topological applications of main results(see \corref{main5}) we show that for a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold on which the Sobolev inequality \eqref{chi-n} holds true, $\dim(M)=n\geq 3$ and $\ric(x)\geq 0$ outside some geodesic ball $B(o,R_0)$, there exists a positive constant $C(n)$ depending only on $n$ such that, if $$\|\ric_-\|_{L^{\frac{n}{2}}}\leq C(n)\mathbb{S}_{\frac{n}{n-2}}(M),$$ then $(M, g)$ is of a unique end.</description>

      <title>A Spinorial Perelman's Functional: Critical Points and Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an energy functional on closed Riemannian spin manifolds which unifies Perelman's W- and F-functionals, Baldauf-Ouzch's E-functional, and Dirchlet energy for spinors. We compute its first variation formula, and show that its critical points under natural constraints are twisted Ricci solitons and eigen-spinsors of the weighted Dirac operator. We introduce a negative L^2-gradient flow of this functional, and establish its short-time existence and uniqueness via contraction mapping methods.</description>

      <title>Sub-Laplacian generalized curvature dimension inequalities on Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Bochner theory and Bakry-Emery calculus for horizontal Laplacians associated with general Riemannian foliations. No bundle-like assumption on the metric, nor any total geodesicity or minimality condition on the leaves is imposed. Using a metric connection adapted to the horizontal-vertical splitting, we derive explicit Bochner formulas for the horizontal Laplacian acting on horizontal and vertical gradients, as well as a unified identity for the full gradient. These formulas involve horizontal Ricci curvature, torsion and vertical mean curvature terms intrinsic to the foliated structure. From these identities, we establish generalized curvature dimension inequalities, extending earlier results in sub-Riemannian geometry. As applications, we obtain horizontal Laplacian comparison theorems, Bonnet-Myers type compactness results with explicit diameter bounds, stochastic completeness, first eigenvalue estimates and gradient and regularization estimates for the horizontal heat semigroup. The framework applies, in particular, to contact manifolds and Carnot groups of arbitrary step.</description>

      <title>Projectively equivalent para-Kaehler and para-Kaehler-Einstein metrics with non-parallel Benenti tensors and their normal forms in dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of projectively equivalent metrics, i.e., metrics sharing the same unparametrized geodesics, is a classical and well-established area of investigation. In the Kaehler context, such branch of research goes by the name of c-projective geometry: it mainly studies c-projectively equivalent metrics, i.e., Kaehler metrics sharing the same curves that are the complex analogue of the geodesics, called J-planar, where J is the complex structure. In this paper, we develop the theory of the projective equivalence in the para-Kaehler context by studying para-Kaehler metrics sharing the same T-planar curves, where T is the para-complex structure: we call such metrics pc-projectively equivalent. After establishing some general results in arbitrary dimension, we focus on the 4-dimensional case. One of the main achievement is a local description of 4-dimensional pc-projectively (but not affinely) equivalent metrics and, as an application of this result, we characterize which of them are of Einstein type.</description>

      <title>Point Particles as Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work surveys a recently developed approach to the study of free point particles on Riemannian manifolds, based on the Kirillov orbit method, geometric quantization, and the geometry of Lagrangian submanifolds. We discuss that given a Lagrangian submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ embedded in a product of coadjoint orbits and a Hamiltonian $H$ attaining its minimum on this submanifold, such a configuration naturally induces free point particle dynamics on $\mathcal{M}$. The metric governing this dynamics is precisely defined by the quadratic expansion of $H$ around its minimum. Upon quantization, this correspondence establishes a relation between the $L^2(\mathcal{M})$ and a corresponding spin chain Hilbert space as well as a spectral equivalence between Laplace-Beltrami operator on $L^2(\mathcal{M})$ and a spin Hamiltonian. Explicit examples of this construction are presented for particles moving on the complex plane, two-dimensional sphere, flag manifolds, and the hyperbolic plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple construction of smooth, asymptotically flat vacuum initial data modeling a relativistic collapsing $N$--body system, with independently prescribed ADM energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum for each component, subject to the timelike condition $\E&gt;|\P|$. The initial data contain no trapped surfaces, and the future development contains multiple causally independent trapped regions that dynamically form from localized subsets of the initial slice. In particular, the maximal development of data with well-separated collapsing components and relative motion is expected to yield spacetimes containing multiple black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-known Faber-Krahn theorem states that the ball has the lowest first Dirichlet eigenvalue among all domains of the same volume in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Leydold (Geom. Funct. Anal, 1997) gave the discrete version of Faber-Krahn inequality for regular trees with boundary. B{\i}y{\i}ko{\u{g}}lu and Leydold (J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2007) demonstrated that the Faber--Krahn inequality holds for the class of trees with boundary with the same degree sequence. They further posed the following question: Give a characterization of all graphs in a given class \(\mathcal{C}\) with the Faber-Krahn property. In this paper, we show the Faber-Krahn property for trees with given matching number. Our result can imply the Klob\"ur\v{s}tel theorem, i.e., the Faber-Krahn inequality for trees with given number of interior vertices and boundary vertices.</description>

Abstract: We show that on a compact complex surface all Massey products of cohomology classes in degree one vanish beyond length three. Dually, the real Malcev completion of the fundamental group is homogeneously presented by quadratic and cubic relations. In the non-K\"ahler case, we give an explicit presentation, which is determined by the first Betti number of the surface.</description>

      <title>On Statistical Inference for Rates of Change in Spatial Processes over Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical inference for spatial processes from partially realized or scattered data has seen voluminous developments in diverse areas ranging from environmental sciences to business and economics. Inference on the associated rates of change has seen some recent developments. The literature has been restricted to Euclidean domains, where inference is sought on directional derivatives, rates along a chosen direction of interest, at arbitrary locations. Inference for higher order rates, particularly directional curvature has also proved useful in these settings. Modern spatial data often arise from non-Euclidean domains. This manuscript particularly considers spatial processes defined over compact Riemannian manifolds. We develop a comprehensive inferential framework for spatial rates of change for such processes over vector fields. In doing so, we formalize smoothness of process realizations and construct differential processes -- the derivative and curvature processes. We derive conditions for kernels that ensure the existence of these processes and establish validity of the joint multivariate process consisting of the ``parent'' Gaussian process (GP) over the manifold and the associated differential processes. Predictive inference on these rates is devised conditioned on the realized process over the manifold. Manifolds arise as polyhedral meshes in practice. The success of our simulation experiments for assessing derivatives for processes observed over such meshes validate our theoretical findings. By enhancing our understanding of GPs on manifolds, this manuscript unlocks a variety of potential applications in machine learning and statistics where GPs have seen wide usage. We propose a fully model-based approach to inference on the differential processes arising from a spatial process from partially observed or realized data across scattered location on a manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes are designed for those who either plan to work in differential geometry, or at least want to have a good reason not to do it. We discuss smooth curves and surfaces -- the main gate to differential geometry. We focus on the techniques that are absolutely essential for further study, keeping it problem-centered, elementary, visual, and virtually rigorous.</description>

Abstract: We show that the volume of transcendental big $(1,1)$-classes on compact K\"ahler manifolds can be realized by convex bodies, thus answering questions of Lazarsfeld-Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Deng. In our approach we use an approximation process by partial Okounkov bodies together with properties of the restricted volume, and we study the extension of K\"ahler currents, as well as the bimeromorphic behavior of currents with analytic singularities. We also establish a connection between transcendental Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations.</description>

      <title>Deformations and desingularizations of conically singular associative submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposals of Joyce [Joy18], and Doan and Walpuski [DW19] on counting closed associative submanifolds of $G_2$-manifolds depend on various conjectural transitions. This article contributes to the study of transitions arising from the degenerations of associative submanifolds into conically singular (CS) associative submanifolds. First, we study the moduli space of CS associative submanifolds with isolated singularities modeled on associative cones in $\mathbb R^7$, establishing transversality results in both fixed and one-parameter family of co-closed $G_2 $-structures. We prove that for a generic co-closed $G_2$-structure (or a generic path thereof) there are no CS associative submanifolds having singularities modeled on cones with stability-index greater than $0$ (or $1$, respectively). We establish that associative cones whose links are null-torsion holomorphic curves in $S^6$ have stability-index greater than $4$, and all special Lagrangian cones in $\mathbb C^3$ have stability-index greater than or equal to $1$ with equality only for the Harvey-Lawson $T^2$-cone and a transverse pair of planes. Next, we study the desingularizations of CS associative submanifolds in a one-parameter family of co-closed $G_2$-structures. Consequently, we derive desingularization results relating the above transitions for CS associative submanifolds with a Harvey-Lawson $T^2$-cone singularity and for associative submanifolds with a transverse self-intersection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09573v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Green's inequality shows that a compact Riemannian manifold with scalar curvature at least $n(n-1)$ has injectivity radius at most $\pi$, and that equality is achieved only for the radius 1 sphere. In this work we show how extra topological assumptions can lead to stronger upper bounds. The topologies we consider are $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{T}^{n-k-2}\times\mathbb{R}^k$ for $n\leq 7$ and $0\leq k\leq 2$ and 3-manifolds with positive scalar curvature except lens spaces $L(p,q)$ with $p$ odd. We also prove a strengthened inequality for $3$-manifolds with positive scalar curvature and large diameter. Our proof uses previous results of Gromov and Zhu.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish new normal scalar curvature inequalities on a class of austere submanifolds by proving sharper DDVV-type inequalities on associated austere subspaces. We also provide some examples of austere submanifolds in this class and point out one of them achieves the equality in our normal scalar curvature inequality everywhere. As a byproduct, we obtain a Simons-type gap theorem for closed austere submanifolds in unit spheres which belong to that class.</description>

      <title>Finsler Metric Clustering in Weighted Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a foundational framework for geometric learning in weighted projective spaces $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{q}}$ by introducing a hierarchical clustering algorithm governed by Finsler geometry. We define a scaling-invariant Finsler metric $d_F([z], [w])$-and its rational analogue $d_{F,\mathbb{Q}}([z], [w])$-derived from an optimization-based Finsler norm that effectively quotients out the weighted scaling action. Unlike previous approaches that characterized these spaces via non-metric dissimilarity measures, we rigorously prove that our construction satisfies the triangle inequality, providing a true metric framework that ensures the stability of hierarchical clustering via the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.
  We demonstrate that this metric approach preserves the intrinsic scaling symmetries and weighted topology of $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{q}}$ without the topological distortions inherent in Euclidean approximations. The algorithm's efficacy is explored in the context of arithmetic geometry (clustering moduli spaces of genus two curves), arithmetic dynamics, and quantum state-space analysis, where the weights $\mathbb{q}$ represent anisotropic physical constraints and noise profiles. This work establishes a robust theoretical foundation for the development of graded neural networks and other machine learning techniques for graded algebraic varieties.</description>

Abstract: We classify the holomorphic parabolic geometries on compact complex manifolds of general type. We accomplish this by bounding the numerical dimension of any smooth projective variety in terms of geometric invariants of the flag variety model of any holomorphic parabolic geometry on that variety. Along the way, we uncover foliations and fibrations on smooth projective varieties that admit holomorphic parabolic geometries.</description>

Abstract: We establish a general min-max type theorem that produces minimal surfaces with prescribed genus in 3-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. An important intermediate step is to show that, in a generic metric with positive Ricci curvature, any family of smooth embedded surfaces, possibly with finitely many singularities, can be deformed into a certain ``topologically optimal family".
  Results in this paper will be crucial to our program on the construction of multiple minimal surfaces with prescribed genus in 3-spheres via topological methods.</description>

Abstract: This is a survey of the twistor lifts of surfaces in $4$-dimensional spaces. In most part of this survey, the space is Euclidean $4$-space $E^4$. The definitions of the Gauss maps and the twistor lifts of surfaces in $E^4$ are given by orthogonal complex structures of $E^4$. Based on these definitions, we can understand holomorphicity of the Gauss maps of minimal surfaces in $E^4$ and isotropicity of such surfaces.</description>

We prove a one-parameter family of weighted Bakry-\'Emery $\Gamma_2$ criterion inequalities which in the limit case yields the improved constant due to Ji \cite{Ji24}. Furthermore, we establish a modified weighted $\Gamma_2$ criterion inequality which could be interpreted as a monotonicity of the Tsallis entropy under the heat flow and yields a family of sharp Sobolev inequalities.</description>

Abstract: Carath\'eodory's conjecture has long been regarded as one of the central problems in the classical theory of convex surfaces. In this paper, we establish an index formula for hemispheres of convex closed surfaces under $C^2$-regularity. The proof is based on studying a vertical section of the null hypersurfaces in Lorentz--Minkowski $4$-space associated with the originally given convex surface. As a consequence, the conjecture is affirmatively solved in the $C^2$-case.</description>

      <title>Contact Lie systems on Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces: from scaling symmetries to curvature-dependent reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an adaptation of the notion of scaling symmetries for the case of Lie-Hamilton systems, allowing their subsequent reduction to contact Lie systems. As an illustration of the procedure, time-dependent frequency oscillators and time-dependent thermodynamic systems are analyzed from this point of view. The formalism provides a novel method for constructing contact Lie systems on the three-dimensional sphere, derived from recently established Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental four-dimensional representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$. It is shown that these systems are a particular case of a larger hierarchy of contact Lie systems on a special class of three-dimensional homogeneous spaces, namely the Cayley-Klein spaces. These include Riemannian spaces (sphere, hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes. Under certain topological conditions, some of these systems retrieve well-known two-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems through a curvature-dependent reduction.</description>

      <title>Volume-Distance-Ratio Asymptote and Spacetime Inextendibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops geometric criteria for determining the inextendibility of spacetimes near singularities based on asymptotic analysis of volume-distance relationships. We introduce and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the volume-distance-ratio (VDR), defined as the ratio of volumes of small chronological diamonds to appropriate powers of distances between their vertices. In $C^0$ and $C^{0,1}$ spacetimes (which are weaker than the classical $C^2$ regularity), we prove that VDR converges to the Minkowski value as chronological diamonds approach accumulation points.
  The central contribution is the establishment of inextendibility criteria showing that failure of VDR convergence to the Minkowski value implies inextendibility of the spacetime. These criteria apply to spacetime extensions satisfying $C^0$ locally-null-non-accumulating strongly-causal conditions and $C^{0,1}$ strongly-causal conditions, where the locally-null-non-accumulation condition is introduced as a fundamental structural property ensuring the validity of VDR-based inextendibility criteria.
  Concrete applications demonstrate the power and scope of these methods. We prove that $2$-dimensional Misner spacetime is $C^0$ strongly-causal inextendible and that spatially flat FLRW spacetimes with linear scale factor behavior are $C^0$ locally-null-non-accumulating strongly-causal inextendible. Furthermore, we establish $C^{0,1}$ strongly-causal inextendibility for Christodoulou's class of spherically symmetric self-similar naked singularity spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of L\'evy processes and financial models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the information geometry of L\'evy processes. As a starting point, we derive the $\alpha$-divergence between two L\'evy processes. Subsequently, the Fisher information matrix and the $\alpha$-connection associated with the geometry of L\'evy processes are computed from the $\alpha$-divergence. In addition, we discuss statistical applications of this information geometry. As illustrative examples, we investigate the differential-geometric structures of various L\'evy processes relevant to financial modeling, including tempered stable processes, the CGMY model, and variance gamma processes.</description>

      <title>An entropy formula for the Deep Linear Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.</description>

      <title>An almost-almost-Schur lemma on the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the conformal class of the standard metric on the $3$-sphere, we prove a quantitative refinement of the Andrews-De Lellis-Topping inequality in terms of a two-term distance to the set of minimizing conformal factors. This inequality is itself a stability result for the well-known Schur lemma and is therefore referred to as almost-Schur lemma. Hence, our stability result may be viewed as an almost-almost-Schur lemma.
  As a consequence, we deduce via interpolation the quantitative stability of an entire family of nonlinear Yamabe-type inequalities, including an inequality for the total volume-normalized $\sigma_2$-curvature $\mathcal F_2$. This extends a recent result by Frank and the second author for $d &gt; 4$ to the case $d=3$. While the standard metric minimizes $\mathcal F_2$ if $d &gt; 4$, it maximizes $\mathcal F_2$ if $d=3$. This is the main challenge in treating the case $d=3$ as it turns the related functional inequality into a reverse Sobolev-type inequality.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness results for positive harmonic functions on manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove some Liouville-type theorems for positive harmonic functions on compact Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary, thereby confirming some cases of Wang's conjecture (J. Geom. Anal. 31, 2021).
  We further investigate Wang's conjecture on warped product manifolds and provide a partial verification of this conjecture, which also yields an alternative proof of Gu-Li's resolution of the conjecture in the $\mathbb{B}^n$ case (Math. Ann. 391, 2025). Our approach is based on a general principle of employing the P-function method to such Liouville-type results, with particular emphasis on the role of a closed conformal vector field inherent to such manifolds.</description>

      <title>Proper solutions of the $1/H$-flow and the Green kernel of the $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show existence and optimal growth estimate for the weak inverse mean curvature flow issuing from a point, on manifolds with certain curvature and isoperimetric conditions. These theorems imply analogous ones for the flow issuing from relatively compact sets. Some of the results are obtained by proving new decay estimates for the Green kernel of the $p$-Laplacian which fix a gap in the literature. Additionally, we address the convergence of renormalized $p$-capacitary potentials to the inverse mean curvature flow with outer obstacle.</description>
