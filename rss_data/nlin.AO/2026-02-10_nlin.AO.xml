      <title>Time delay in the 1d swarmalator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 1d swarmalator model augmented with time delayed coupling. Along with the familiar sync, async, and phase wave states, we find a family of unsteady states where the order parameters are time periodic, sometimes with clean oscillations, sometimes with irregular vacillations. The unsteady states are born in two ways: via a Hopf bifurcation from the phase wave, and a zero eigenvalue bifurcation from the async state. We find both of these boundary curves analytically. A surprising result is that stabilities of the async and sync states are independent of the delay {\tau}; they depend only on the coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Physical Analog Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks based on Reconfigurable Nonlinear-Processing Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) shift neural computation from linear layers to learnable nonlinear edge functions, but implementing these nonlinearities efficiently in hardware remains an open challenge. Here we introduce a physical analog KAN architecture in which edge functions are realized in materia using reconfigurable nonlinear-processing units (RNPUs): multi-terminal nanoscale silicon devices whose input-output characteristics are tuned via control voltages. By combining multiple RNPUs into an edge processor and assembling these blocks into a reconfigurable analog KAN (aKAN) architecture with integrated mixed-signal interfacing, we establish a realistic system-level hardware implementation that enables compact KAN-style regression and classification with programmable nonlinear transformations. Using experimentally calibrated RNPU models and hardware measurements, we demonstrate accurate function approximation across increasing task complexity while requiring fewer or comparable trainable parameters than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). System-level estimates indicate an energy per inference of $\sim$250 pJ and an end-to-end inference latency of $\sim$600 ns for a representative workload, corresponding to a $\sim$10$^{2}$-10$^{3}\times$ reduction in energy accompanied by a $\sim$10$\times$ reduction in area compared to a digital fixed-point MLP at similar approximation error. These results establish RNPUs as scalable, hardware-native nonlinear computing primitives and identify analog KAN architectures as a realistic silicon-based pathway toward energy-, latency-, and footprint-efficient analog neural-network hardware, particularly for edge inference.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Driven Reversible Logic Accelerates Efficient Irreversible Universal Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present implementations of two physically-embedded computation-universal logical operations using a 2-bit logical unit composed of coupled quantum flux parametrons -- Josephson-junction superconducting circuits. To illustrate universality, we investigate NAND gates built from these two distinct elementary operations. On the one hand, Controlled Erasure (CE) is designed using fixed-point analysis and assumes that information must be stored in locally-metastable distributions. On the other, Erasure-Flip (EF) leverages momentum as a computational resource and significantly outperforms the metastable approach, simultaneously achieving higher fidelity and faster computational speed without incurring any additional energetic cost. Notably, the momentum degree of freedom allows the EF to achieve universality by using both nontrivial reversible and irreversible logic simultaneously in different logical subspaces. These results not only provide a practical, high-performance protocol ripe for experimental realization but also underscore the broader potential of momentum-based computing paradigms.</description>

      <title>Extreme vulnerability to intruder attacks destabilizes network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consensus, synchronization, formation control, and power grid balance are all examples of virtuous dynamical states that may arise in networks. Here, we focus on how such states can be destabilized from a fundamental perspective; namely, we address the question of how one or a few intruder agents within an otherwise functioning network may compromise its dynamics. We show that a single adversarial node coupled via adversarial connections to one or more other nodes is sufficient to destabilize the entire network, which we prove to be more efficient than targeting multiple nodes. Then, we show that concentrating the attack on a single low-degree node induces the greatest instability, challenging the common assumption that hubs are the most critical nodes. This leads to a new characterization of the vulnerability of a node, which contrasts with previous work, and identifies low-indegree nodes (as opposed to the hubs) as the most vulnerable components of a network. Our results are derived for linear systems but hold true for nonlinear networks, including those described by the Kuramoto model. Finally, we derive scaling laws showing that larger networks are less susceptible, on average, to single-node attacks. Overall, these findings highlight an intrinsic vulnerability of technological systems, such as autonomous networks, sensor networks, power grids, and the Internet of Things, with implications that extend also to the realm of complex social and biological networks.</description>

      <title>The effect of role-based resource allocation on epidemic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a coupled dynamical model of resource allocation and epidemic spread, inspired by the hierarchical structure of real-world therapeutic resource allocation. In this framework, network nodes are assigned distinct roles as either resource allocators or resource recipients. As the average number of links per recipient from allocators increases, the prevalence exhibits one of four distinct response patterns across conditions: monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, U-shaped trend, or a sudden decrease with large fluctuations. A mechanistic analysis uncovers three central insights: (i) a trade-off between efficient resource allocation and infection risk faced by allocators, (ii) the critical need to avoid resource redundancy when therapeutic efficiency is high, and (iii) the emergence of cascade-induced bistability in the coupled system.</description>
