      <title>SN 2024afav: A Superluminous Supernova with Multiple Light Curve Bumps and Spectroscopic Signatures of Circumstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive optical and near-infrared spectroscopic study of SN 2024afav - a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) that peaks at $\approx$ -20.7 mag and exhibits an unusual multi-bumped light curve. Our spectroscopic observations, spanning phases of -14 to +160 d, reveal several unusual features: (i) a narrow (1,800 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted (11,000 km s$^{-1}$) absorption from H$\alpha$ starting at +20 d; (ii) persistent optical and NIR He I lines at all available phases, showing double absorption structure in NIR spectra at +23 d, with a high velocity component at a similar velocity to H$\alpha$; (iii) early appearance of nebular [O III] emission starting at $\approx$ +50 d; and (iv) strong [O II] + [Ca II] 7300 {\AA} emission complex starting at $\approx$ +110 d. These unusual features, and their onset at the time of the light curve bumps, provide compelling evidence of circumstellar interaction between the SN ejecta and a nearby hydrogen-rich shell, as well as the presence of helium in both the outer layers of the progenitor star and in the circumstellar medium. A comparison of SN 2024afav to other SLSNe-I showing bumpy light curves and similar spectral properties (PTF10hgi, SN 2017egm, SN 2019hge), points to a rare sub-group of SLSNe-I in which CSM interaction provides an important modulation to the energy input.</description>

      <title>A Test of Substellar Evolutionary Models with High-Precision Ages from Asteroseismology and Gyrochronology for the Benchmark System HR 7672AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-precision measurements for HR 7672AB, composed of a Sun-like (G0V) star and an L dwarf companion. Three nights of precise (70 cm/s) radial velocity (RV) asteroseismology with the Keck Planet Finder clearly detect 5-minute oscillations from the primary HR 7672A, and modeling of the frequency spectrum yields an asteroseismic age of $1.87\pm0.65$ Gyr. We also determine a gyrochronological age of $2.58\pm0.47$ Gyr, and we combine these two results for a final age of $2.26\pm0.40$ Gyr. In addition, we obtained new RVs for HR 7672A and new astrometry for the companion HR 7672B. From a joint orbit fit, we measured a dynamical mass of $1.111\pm0.017$ $M_\odot$ for HR 7672A and $75.39\pm0.67$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for HR 7672B. This places the companion near the stellar/substellar boundary and thus particularly sensitive to differences in model predictions. The joint precision in host star age (18\% uncertainty) and companion mass (0.9\% uncertainty) makes HR 7672AB an exceptional substellar benchmark. Combined with the companion's luminosity, we use these measurements to test predictions from six brown dwarf cooling models. The best agreement occurs with the Chabrier et al. (2023) models, which incorporate a new equation of state, resulting in predictions that agree within $&lt;$0.3$\sigma$ with all the observations. The other 5 sets of models agree at the 1--3$\sigma$ level depending on the particular test, and some models struggle to predict a sufficient low luminosity for HR 7672B at any age given its dynamical mass. Finally, we detected a weak seismic signal in near-simultaneous TESS photometry of HR 7672A, with the resulting RV-to-photometry oscillation amplitude ratio consistent with solar values.</description>

      <title>Photometric Analysis of TCP J20171288$+$1156589 -- WZ Sge Type Dwarf Nova with Delayed Ordinary Superhumps Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of photometric analysis of WZ Sge type dwarf nova TCP J20171288$+$1156589. This object exhibited an outburst with a large amplitude of $&gt;7.9$ magnitudes and was observed for over a month. The photometric evolution of the superoutburst was atypical for WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. Periodogram analisys reveals early superhumps with the most probable period of $0.0611\pm0.0001$ days during the initial decline. After a plateau phase of approximately 11 days, ordinary superhumps (likely stage B) emerged with a period of $0.0616\pm0.0001$ days, corresponding to a superhump excess of $\epsilon=0.008$ correspondingly. This delay in the onset of ordinary superhumps is an unusual feature among WZ Sge stars. We evaluated the main parameters of the system: mass ratio $q=M_{RD}/M_{WD}=0.06\pm0.005$, yielding component masses of $M_{WD}\sim1.0\pm0.15M_{\odot}$ for the white dwarf and $M_{RD}=0.06\pm0.01M_{\odot}$ for the donor. The estimated distance to the system is $\sim850$ pc, and the binary separation is $a=0.67\pm0.03R_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of circumstellar disk lifetimes: Disk evolution in a single star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining how long circumstellar disks last is key to understanding the timescale of planet formation. Typically, this is done by measuring the fraction of young stars with infrared-excess, a sign of circumstellar material, in stellar clusters of different ages. However, comparing data from different star-forming regions at different distances introduces uncertainties and biases because of the different sample completeness and environment. This study addresses these challenges by analyzing 33 clusters, aged 3 to 21 million years (PARSEC isochrones), within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, sampling the stellar IMF from the hydrogen burning limit to about 8 M$_\odot$. By using $\mathit{Gaia}$, 2MASS, and WISE data, we identified stars with infrared-excess through color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions, ensuring a consistent selection of disk-bearing sources. Our results indicate a disk lifetime of $5.8 \pm 0.3$ Myr, about a factor of two longer than most previous estimates, suggesting that planet formation may have more time than previously thought. We also find that an exponential decay model best describes disk dispersal. These findings emphasize the importance of studying disk evolution in a single star-forming region to reduce uncertainties and refine our understanding of planet formation timelines.</description>

      <title>Giant outbursts of clumpy material preceding Type II supernova 2024qiw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of core-collapse supernovae suggest that some massive stars undergo intense mass loss shortly before explosion, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report evidence of giant outbursts of clumpy material from a massive star in the final decades before explosion. Photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric data of SN~2024qiw reveal a bumpy light curve, a broad H$\alpha$ profile, and variable polarization, all consistent with interaction between SN ejecta and clumpy circumstellar material, implying a mass-loss rate of $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Taken together, the most likely explanation is multiple major eruptions, similar to those of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), but occurring shortly before explosion. This challenges standard stellar evolution theory by requiring either that LBVs explode terminally, or that other evolutionary phases produce eruptive episodes. In spite of very high pre-SN mass loss, the resulting SN is of Type~II, rather than Type IIn, highlighting diverse and previously unrecognized late-stage mass-loss processes.</description>

      <title>Small EUV Brightenings in the Quiet Solar Atmosphere: New Insights from the Solar Orbiter Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the many outcomes of the Solar Orbiter mission is the evidence for the solar atmosphere being filled by highly impulsive bursts, down to about 200 km scale: the limit of the EUV instruments' spatial resolution. Small-scale events of this kind were already known, but their observation was occasional or with limited, lower resolution. Solar Orbiter has revealed that small scale, highly impulsive events are everywhere on the quiet Sun, all the time, at even smaller scales. Their similarity with known larger features, are the witnesses that the physical processes causing them are independent of the spatial scales involved. Their highly dynamic property is the signature of energy transfer and/or local dissipation. Their investigation can thus elucidate on the dominant physical processes acting on the solar atmosphere and on the possible role in the origin of the hot solar corona. In this review, we will present a summary of the observational and simulation results on this topic, led by the results from data taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI)/High Resolution Imagers (HRIEUV) instrument. Here, we will cover both statistical properties and analyses of individual events.</description>

      <title>BSN: Light Curve Modeling and Orbital Evolution of the Total-Eclipse Contact Binary EZ Oct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detailed multiband (BVR_cI_c and TESS) photometric analysis of the short-period binary EZ Oct. This study combines ground-based observations conducted at a Southern Hemisphere observatory in Argentina with data from the TESS mission. Investigating the orbital period variations of EZ Oct reveals a steadily increasing period consistent with a quadratic trend. We present a new ephemeris and estimate the mass transfer rate as \dot{M}=1.353*10^{-8} M_{\odot}/year, indicating ongoing conservative mass transfer from the less massive to the more massive star. Light curve modeling was performed using the PHOEBE Python code in conjunction with the MCMC approach, and the inclusion of a cold starspot was required to achieve an adequate fit. Absolute parameters were estimated using Gaia DR3 parallax and astrophysical equations. Our analysis shows that EZ Oct is a total-eclipse contact binary with a mass ratio of 1.969, a fillout factor of 0.106, and an inclination of 82.13deg. Based on the stellar masses and temperatures of the components, the target system belongs to the W-subtype of contact binaries. The positions of the component stars were displayed on the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams to illustrate their evolutionary status. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between orbital period and stellar luminosity in contact binary stars using a sample of 461 systems with P&lt;0.5 days. We highlight the position of EZ Oct in the mass ratio-inclination parameter space, showing that it lies within the densely populated region of contact binaries.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Evolutionary Status of Massive Stars at the central parsec of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars and their winds have a large influence in their environment, e.g, determining the accretion rate on to the Galactic Centre (GC) super-massive black hole Sgr A*. The winds of those stars collide and are accreted, at a rate that depends on their chemical composition. Here we aim to revisit the evolutionary status of the evolved massive stars at the GC, by means of new tracks based on updated mass-loss rate recipes for the earlier stages of massive stars.
  We use the Geneva-evolution-code for initial stellar masses ranging from 20 to 60 $M_\odot$, for metallicity $Z=0.020$. We adopt a new mass-loss rate recipe for the line-driven winds of O-type stars and B-supergiants, plus a new recipe for the dust-driven winds of red supergiants (RSG). Additionally, we set up initial rotation $\Omega/\Omega_\text{crit}=0.4$, and we adopt the Ledoux criterion for the treatment of convection in inner layers.
  We found that evolution models adopting new mass-loss rate prescriptions predict that stars will lose less of their outer layers during their initial phases, while a big reduction of mass happens at the RSG phase. As a consequence, the resulting Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are less radially homogeneous in their inner structure from the core to the surface. Also, these new evolution models predict the absence of hydrogen-free WN stars. These evolutionary predictions agree better with the observed chemical abundances of the WR stars at the GC.
  We provide a table with the chemical H, He, and CNO abundances calculated for the different subtypes of WR stars. We propose a different re-arrangement of the WR subtypes to be used for the modelling of the collision of their winds. We discuss the potential implications of these changes for the colliding winds generated from the massive stars at the GC, which are accreting onto the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>The influence of Parker spiral on the reflection-driven turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind is observed to undergo substantial heating as it expands through the heliosphere, with measured temperature profiles exceeding those expected from adiabatic cooling. A plausible source of this heating is reflection-driven turbulence (RDT), in which gradients in the background Alfv\'en speed partially reflect outward-propagating Alfv\'en waves, seeding counter-propagating fluctuations that interact and dissipate via turbulence. Previous RDT models assume a radial background magnetic field, but at larger radii the interplanetary field is known to be twisted into the Parker Spiral (PS). Here, we generalize RDT phenomenology to include a PS, using three-dimensional expanding-box magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to test the ideas and compare the resulting turbulence to the radial-background-field case. We argue that the underlying RDT dynamics remain broadly similar with a PS, but the controlling scales change: as the azimuthal field grows it "cuts across" perpendicularly stretched, pancake-like eddies, producing outer scales perpendicular to the magnetic field that are much smaller than in the radial-background case. Consequently, the outer-scale nonlinear turnover time increases more slowly with heliocentric distance in PS geometry, weakening the tendency (seen in radial-background models) for the cascade to 'freeze' into quasi-static, magnetically dominated structures. This allows the system to dissipate a larger fraction of the fluctuation energy as heat, also implying that the turbulence remains strongly imbalanced (with high normalized cross-helicity) out to larger heliocentric distances. We complement our heating results with a detailed characterization of the turbulence (e.g., spectra, switchbacks, and compressive fractions) providing a set of concrete predictions for comparison with spacecraft observations.</description>

      <title>Two-stage primary acceleration in filament initial eruption under a fan-spine magnetic configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understaning the filament rising process is crucial for unveiling the triggering mechanisms of the coronal mass ejections and forecasting the space weather. In this paper, we present a detailed study on the filament initial eruption under a fan-spine structure. It was found that the filament underwent two distinct acceleration stages corresponding to a calss M1.0 and M4.6 flare event, respectively. The first acceleration stage commenced with the filament splitting, after which the upper portion was subsequently heated being a hot channel and slow rose at an average speed of 22 km/s. A set of hot reverse C-shaped loops appeared repeatedly during the filament splitting and a hook structure was recognized at this phase, suggesting ongoing growth of the magnetic flux rope (MFR). When it reached a certain altitude, the hot channel appeared to get into a quasi-static phase with its upper edge seriously decelerated and lower edge expanding downward. Approximately 30 minutes later, as a distinct annular ribbon appeared outside the hook structure, the hot channel rose again at a velocity over 50 km/s accompanied with rapid footpoints drifting, and experienced the second acceleration stage with its axial flux increased to 1.1 X 10^{21} Mx. It is deduced that the filament initial eruption under a magnetic dome possess multi kinetic process. We suggest that the magnetic reconnection taken place within and beneath the filament continues to trigger the growth of pre-eruptive MFR and the first acceleration, when the magnetic reconnection above the filament plays a key role in the second acceleration.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Dynamical Relations between Spicules and Network Bright Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spicules are among the most ubiquitous small-scale, jet-like features in the solar chromosphere and are widely believed to play a significant role in transporting mass and energy into the solar corona with their mechanisms not fully understood. We utilize high-resolution H$\alpha$ images acquired from the 1.6-meter Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) to investigate spatial and the dynamical properties of both spicules and network bright points (NBPs) and, for the first time, incorporated NBP motions in the analyses of spicules. Our main results are as follows: (1) The speed distributions of blueshifted spicules and NBPs both exhibit distinct peaks, whereas that of redshifted spicules is monotonically decreasing. (2) Torsional motions of spicules inferred from alternating signs of Dopplershifts are faster than the NBPs' transversal motions by a factor of $10-10^2$, which may imply the mass density ratio in two different heights as $10^2-10^4$. (3) Blueshifted spicules are found to be more abundant than redshifted spicules in general, but their relative population difference reduces to ~10% at Doppler speeds above 35 km s$^{-1}$. (4) Redshifted spicules lying at higher heights share morphological and dynamical similarity with the blueshifted spicules, which implies the same driving mechanism operating in both directions. (5) These two populations appear above NBPs concentrated under the AIA 193 A bright region. We interpret these results in favor of a scenario that Alfven waves generated by NBPs motions impart their energies to spicules in both torsional and field-aligned motions, and also contribute to the coronal heating and possibly the acceleration of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Revealing the accelerating wind in the inner region of the colliding-wind binary WR 112</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colliding winds in massive binaries generate X-ray-bright shocks, synchrotron radio emission, and sometimes even dusty "pinwheel" spirals. We report the first X-ray detections of the dusty WC+O binary system WR 112 from Chandra and Swift, alongside 27 years of VLA/ATCA radio monitoring and new diffraction-limited Keck images. Because we view the nearly circular orbit almost edge-on, the colliding-wind zone alternates between heavy Wolf-Rayet wind self-absorption and a near-transparent O-star wind foreground each 20-yr orbit, producing phase-locked radio and X-ray variability. This scenario leads to a prediction that the radio spectral index is flatter from a larger non-thermal contribution around the radio intensity maximum, which is indeed observed. Existing models that assume a single dust-expansion speed fail to reproduce the combined infrared geometry and radio light curve. Instead, we require an accelerating post-shock flow that climbs from near-stationary to ~1350 km/s in about one orbital cycle, naturally matching the infrared spiral from about 5" down to within 0.1", while also fitting the phase of the radio brightening. These kinematic constraints supply critical boundary conditions for future hydrodynamic simulations, which can link hot-plasma cooling, non-thermal radio emission, X-ray spectra, and dust formation in a self-consistent framework. WR 112 thus joins WR 140, WR 104, and WR 70-16 (Apep) as a benchmark system for testing colliding-wind physics under an increasingly diverse range of orbital architectures and physical conditions.</description>

      <title>An Ancient Brown Dwarf Transiting a Metal-Poor Thick Disk Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of TOI-7019b, the first transiting brown dwarf (BD) known to orbit a star that is part of the Milky Way's ancient thick disk, as defined chemically ([Fe/H] $= -0.79 \pm 0.05$ dex, [$\alpha$/Fe] $= +0.26 \pm 0.05$ dex, [M/H] $= -0.59 \pm 0.06$ dex) and kinematically ($v_{\perp} \approx 150 \pm 1$ km s$^{-1}$). We estimate a system age $\tau = 12 \pm 2$ Gyr by fitting the host star's spectrum and spectral energy distribution to alpha-enhanced isochrones, and independently using the age-metallicity relation of the thick disk. This makes TOI-7019 by far the most metal-poor and ancient BD host known to date. We measure a BD mass of $61.3 \pm 2.1$ $M_{\rm J}$ and radius of $0.82 \pm 0.02$ $R_{\rm J}$ from a joint analysis of transit photometry and radial velocity measurements, along with an orbital period of $48.2592 \pm 0.0001$ days and an orbital eccentricity of $0.403 \pm 0.002$. The measured radius appears $12.3\% \pm 2.8\%$ larger than predicted relative to standard evolutionary models for old, metal-poor brown dwarfs, hinting at missing physics like the magnetic inhibition of convection. TOI-7019b lowers the probed metallicity regime for transiting BDs by over a factor of two, making it a benchmark system to test evolutionary models in the low-metallicity regime. Future measurements of TOI-7019b's atmosphere will test whether a brown dwarf's atmospheric composition tracks its host star's abundances, as expected for binary-like co-formation.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Project: Bridging Intermediate- and High-Mass Star Formation with the MIRION Catalog of Yellowballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the construction and use of the Mid-InfraRed Interstellar Objects and Nebulae (MIRION) catalog, which was compiled from 6176 objects identified as "yellowballs" (YBs) by participants in the Milky Way Project. The majority of YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects that are embedded in star-forming clumps ranging in mass from ten to one million solar masses and luminosity from ten to ten thousand solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) by nearly two orders of magnitude, providing an extensive database with which to explore the transition from isolated low-mass to clustered high-mass star formation. The catalog comprises five tables that include mid- and far-infrared photometry; velocities of source-associated molecular clouds; distances to these molecular clouds; physical properties of source-associated star-forming clumps; and source crossmatches with other catalogs. The structure of the catalog enables users to easily sort objects for further study based on distance or environmental properties. Our preliminary analysis extends our earlier findings that indicate a relationship between IR colors and the physical properties and evolutionary stages of SFRs. Photometry will be periodically updated online to incorporate measurements from volunteers participating in a classroom activity known as the People Enabling Research: a Yellowball Survey of the Colors Of Protostellar Environments (PERYSCOPE) Project. These updates will continue to refine the IR flux measurements and reduce photometric errors. A follow-up paper will present a detailed analysis of how IR colors can be used to predict the properties of star-forming environments.</description>

      <title>Modelling dust coagulation, dynamical drag and turbulent mixing during star and disc formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet formation in the discs around young stars involves the coagulation of sub-micron sized dust grains into much larger grains that may be mixed by turbulence and migrate through the disc. In this paper, we describe how we have combined a method for modelling the coagulation of a population of dust grains with the MULTIGRAIN algorithm for modelling the dynamical evolution of a population of dust grains that are subject to strong gas drag. We solve the dynamical evolution of the dust grains due to gas drag using a recently-developed implicit integration method, and we introduce a new implicit method to model the diffusion of the dust due to unresolved hydrodynamic turbulence. The resulting smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code allows us, for the first time, to model the growth, mixing and migration of dust grain populations during the early stages of star formation and the formation, growth and evolution of a young protoplanetary disc using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. In doing so, we find that including turbulent dust diffusion within the disc provides a substantial enhancement of the rate of dust grain growth due to the fact that the turbulent diffusion provides a source of small and intermediate dust grains to the regions in which the largest dust grains are growing.</description>

      <title>Water vapor emission at the warm cavity wall of the HD 100546 disk as revealed by ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the water line at 183 GHz in the disk around the Herbig star HD 100546. The water vapor emission peaks at the inner edge of the warm dust cavity, located ~15 au from the central star. We attribute this to thermal desorption at the water snowline, shifted outward at the dust cavity wall directly heated by the intense radiation. This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.</description>

Abstract: We report a mm-wave search for axions from the magnetar SGR 1745-2900, based on 4.8 h of ALMA observations. No statistically significant features are detected between 133.99-135.78, 135.91-137.70, 145.99-147.78, and 147.99-149.78 GHz. Interpreting this null result via resonant conversion with a state-of-the-art star model and the dark-matter density expected at the Galactic Center, we constrain the axion-photon coupling at the level of $g_{\gamma}\gtrsim 2\times10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ within 0.55-0.62 meV, accessing for the first time the QCD axion parameter space near the meV scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy probes exoplanet atmospheres via the wavelength dependence of transit depths, but stellar contamination from magnetic activity can significantly bias these measurements. Activity-induced changes in the chromatic apparent stellar radius represent a major challenge for atmospheric characterisation. As surface distributions of magnetic features are generally unknown for stars other than the Sun, we adopt the Sun as a benchmark to study how the chromatic effect depends on the distribution of spots and faculae. Using spot and facular masks derived from SDO/HMI magnetograms and intensitygrams, combined with the SATIRE model, we compute the chromatic dependence of the Sun's apparent radius. We test different methods of convolving surface coverage with spectra the identify physical drivers of the effect. We find that simplified approaches, which neglect the CLV, underestimate the apparent radius, particularly for faculae, whose surface coverage dominates at near-solar activity levels. Proper treatment of facular CLV is therefore essential. The activity-induced variation between solar minimum and maximum reaches around 40 ppm for a Jupiter-like transit, exceeding JWST's expected 10 ppm noise floor, while remaining at around 0.4 ppm for an Earth-like transit.</description>

      <title>Optical Study of TRAPUM Pulsars and Modelling of the Redbacks: PSR J1036$-$4353 and PSR J1803$-$6707</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM) project discovered eight binary millisecond pulsars in its first shallow \textit{L}-band survey of unidentified \textit{Fermi} $\gamma$-ray sources using the MeerKAT radio telescope. We conducted follow-up observations using ULTRACAM on the New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory to search for the optical counterpart to the pulsar companions. We found two redback companions, in PSRs J1803$-$6707 and J1036$-$4353, and provided upper limits for the other pulsar binaries. We used the \texttt{Icarus} code to fit the redback's light curves using various irradiation models. The asymmetric double-peak light curves of PSR~J1036$-$4353 are best fit with diffusion and convection models. Comparing the two prescriptions of irradiation and gravity darkening, models with post-irradiation gravity darkening provide superior fits (particularly for lower gravity-darkening exponents), suggesting that the irradiation energy is deposited deep in the stellar photosphere. PSR~J1803$-$6707, on the other hand, displayed variability in the amplitude of its irradiation-dominated light curves over a time scale of a few months. This effect can be modelled only if the companion's filling, irradiation temperature, and convection coefficients are allowed to vary over time. Had the star been closer to filling its Roche lobe, like in the cases of the known transitional millisecond pulsars J1023+0038 and J1227$-$4853, this 4.1 per~cent variation in the volume-averaged filling of the star would have caused it to experience a state change to form an active accretion disc.</description>

      <title>The impact of surface acetylene cyclotrimerization on the abundance of aromatic hydrocarbons in carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the catalytic role of dust grains in forming aromatic hydrocarbons via acetylene cyclotrimerization on their surfaces within the circumstellar envelopes of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We present a comprehensive computational astrochemical model coupling the gas-phase, gas-surface, and surface (cyclotrimerization) reactions, and the physical evolution of the dust grains (coagulation). The model expands upon the basic chemical network from previous models, enhancing them with updated reactions involving hydrocarbons up to pyrene. We applied this model to simulate the chemical evolution of the envelope of the prototypical AGB star IRC+10216, utilizing physical conditions derived from a hydrodynamical model available in literature. To quantify the impact of surface chemistry, we compared scenarios with and without the cyclotrimerization reaction, further testing the sensitivity of our results by varying the key parameter of hydrocarbon desorption energy. We find that surface-catalyzed cyclotrimerization is a viable pathway for aromatic formation in circumstellar environments, capable of enhancing the total abundance of aromatic species by up to an order of magnitude. Crucially, we show that gas-phase chemistry and dust surface processes are intrinsically linked; their synergistic evolution should be modeled self-consistently to accurately predict chemical abundances. This work underscores that constraining uncertain parameters, particularly desorption energies of hydrocarbons, is essential for future realistic modeling of astrochemical processes in evolved stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the atmosphere of HAT-P-70b with CARMENES high-resolution transmission spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to hot and inflated envelopes that facilitate atmospheric studies, ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) have attracted much attention. Significant progress has been achieved, from enlarging the sample size to broadening the studies to encompass diverse stellar types and ages. Here, we present a transmission spectroscopy study of HAT-P-70b, an UHJ orbiting a young A-type star, through high-resolution observations with CARMENES at the 3.5m Calar Alto telescope. By using the line-by-line technique, we confirm the previous detections of Ha, Na I, and Ca II, report a new tentative detection of K I, and impose an upper limit on the He triplet absorption. Through cross-correlation analysis, we identify the Ca II and Fe I absorptions, both blue-shifted by approximately 5 km/s, indicating a day-to-night side atmospheric wind. Additionally, we find a new tentative detection of K I. We do not see any significant atmospheric molecular signal in the near-infrared data. Putting HAT-P-70b in the context of UHJs from the literature, it turns out that (1) Ha absorption is more common on gas giants orbiting stars younger than 1 Gyr, with a relative detection probability of $P_{\rm Age&lt;1\,Gyr}({\rm Ha})/P_{\rm Age\geq1\,Gyr}({\rm Ha})\sim 3$; (2) any UHJ is likely to exhibit Fe I absorption if it has Ca II.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Planetary Formation and Evolution in Star Clusters(UPiC)-II: Catalog of planets/candidates in Open Clusters and Moving Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting planets in open clusters offers a unique opportunity to test planet formation theories in clustered environments. The precisely determined ages of young open clusters make their planets particularly valuable for tracing the early evolution of planetary systems. As the second paper of the UPiC project, this study focuses on stars in stellar groups that host transiting planets or planetary candidates. We categorize these stellar groups into Open Clusters (OCs) and Moving Groups (MGs) based on the Jacobi radius to investigate potential differences in their planetary systems. By cross-matching the latest star cluster catalogs with catalogs of transiting planets and candidates, we have compiled the most extensive catalog to date, containing 106 confirmed planets and 168 candidates within OCs and MGs. We refitted the structural parameters of these stellar groups and identified substructures using the \texttt{HDBSCAN} and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithms. Our analysis reveals the density evolution of both MGs and OCs during their first Gyr. We find that MGs consistently exhibit a significantly higher planet fraction than OCs, regardless of sample selection, particularly for Hot Jupiters. Furthermore, exoplanet radii show a clear dichotomy at early stages: most sub-Jupiters evolve into Neptune-sized planets within 100 Myr, while super-Jupiters undergo only minimal contraction. These results suggest that young sub-Jupiters (\textless 100 Myr) represent puffy, Neptune-mass planets undergoing vigorous photoevaporation, whereas Jupiter-mass planets can maintain their atmospheres. We also report evidence for the early emergence of the hot-Neptune desert at 100 Myr in both OCs and MGs.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Escaping Cosmic Rays and Interstellar Medium: Driving of Galactic Winds and Shaping the Local Proton Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of escaping cosmic rays (CRs) on the interstellar medium (ISM) around their source with spherically symmetric CR-hydrodynamical simulations taking into account the evolution of the CR energy spectrum, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. We show how the escaping CRs accelerate and heat the ISM fluid depending on the CR diffusion coefficient. The CR heating effects are potentially responsible for the recent observations of the unexpected H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 lines in old supernova remnants. The implied gas outflow by CRs can be comparable to the Galactic star formation rate, compatible with the Galactic wind required for the metal-polluted halo gas and the production of eROSITA bubbles. Assuming a locally suppressed CR diffusion and a few nearby CR sources in the Local Bubble, we also propose alternative interpretations for the Galactic CR proton spectrum around the Earth measured with CALET, AMS02, and Voyager I.</description>

      <title>Understanding post-red giant branch binaries through stable mass transfer</title>

Abstract: Post-RGB and post-AGB binaries consist of a primary star that has recently evolved off either the RGB or AGB after losing most of its envelope, and a main-sequence companion. They are distinguished by luminosities below and above the RGB tip, respectively. These systems host a stable, dusty circumbinary disc, characterised by a near-infrared excess. Observed Galactic post-AGB and post-RGB binaries have orbital periods and eccentricities inconsistent with binary population synthesis models. Here, we focus on post-RGB binaries, testing whether stable mass transfer can explain their orbital periods by comparing models with the known sample of 38 Galactic post-RGB binaries. We systematically determined luminosities of Galactic post-RGB and post-AGB binaries through SED fitting. We computed evolution models for low- and intermediate-mass binaries with RGB donors at two metallicities using MESA. We selected stable mass transfer models producing primaries with effective temperatures within the observed range. From these models, we find that low-mass post-RGB binaries should follow strict luminosity-orbital period relations. The Galactic post-RGB binaries seem consistent with these relations if their orbits remained eccentric during mass transfer and if the donor filled its Roche lobe at periastron. However, our models are unable to explain the eccentricities themselves. Moreover, post-mass-transfer ages from our models are much longer than predicted dissipation timescales of circumbinary discs. Stable mass transfer seems to explain the orbital periods of Galactic post-RGB binaries. This formation channel can be tested further by obtaining orbits of additional Galactic systems and Magellanic Cloud candidates via long-term radial velocity monitoring. Gaia DR 4 will improve luminosities of Galactic post-RGB binaries, enabling more accurate comparison with luminosity-orbital period relations.</description>

      <title>Combining spectral analysis and narrow band pass filtering to predict solar cycle parameters in the next solar grand minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for predicting sunspot number (SSN) that, based on successful back projections, can predict features of the SSN several solar cycles in advance. The method applies Fourier analysis to the annual SILSO SSN record, from 1700.5 to 2023.5, to identify in the spectrum, four strong components in the decadal, 10 to 11 year period, range and four weaker components in the octal, 8 to 9 year period, range. The time variation of each component is isolated by a new method of narrow band pass filtering. The components are fitted with sinusoids at the beginning/end of the SSN record for back/forward projection. Back projection successfully replicated the long term features of the Maunder Minimum. Forward projection predicts a Maunder-like grand minimum from 2030 to 2110, encompassing solar cycles 26 to 35. Details of short term features of SSN within the grand minimum are less certain. The octal contribution to SSN is shown to occasionally exceed the decadal contribution both in the projection and also within the observational record. Predicted SSN amplitudes for cycles 26 and 28 are about 50, about half the amplitude of cycles 24 and 25. The amplitude of cycle 27 is difficult to forecast as it may emerge as a double peak of cycle 26 rather than as two separate cycles 26 and 27. Amplitudes forecast for cycles 29 to 33 are, on average, about half the amplitude of cycles 26 and 27 with the lowest cycle of the grand minimum, cycle 30, occurring around 2070. Interference between the octal and decadal components evident in the SSN spectrum are shown to result in micro changes in SSN such as the Waldmeier Effect. Inter group results in the occurrence of grand solar minima and maxima. Intra component group interference results in long term variation grand maxima/minima patterns that may relate to the occurrence of long term climate variability.</description>

      <title>OASIS Survey Direct Imaging and Astrometric Discovery of HIP 71618 B: A Substellar Companion Suitable for the Roman Coronagraph Technology Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the OASIS survey program discovery of a substellar companion orbiting the young A1V star HIP 71618, detected using precision astrometry from Gaia and Hipparcos and high-contrast imaging with SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2. Atmospheric modeling favors a spectral type of M5--M8 and a temperature of $\sim$2700 $\pm$ 100 $K$.
  Dynamical modeling constrains HIP 71618 B's mass to be ${60}_{-21}^{+27}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ or ${65}_{-29}^{+54}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, depending on the adopted companion mass prior. It has a nearly edge-on, 11 au-orbit with a high eccentricity. HIP 71618 B will be located within Roman Coronagraph's dark hole region during the instrument's technological demonstration phase. A high signal-to-noise ratio detection of HIP 71618 B at 575 nm would demonstrate a 5-$\sigma$ contrast of 10$^{-7}$ or better. The system is also located within or very close to Roman's Continuous Viewing Zone -- near multiple candidate reference stars for dark-hole digging -- and its primary is bright ($V$ $\approx$ 5). The suitability of HIP 71618 as one potential Roman Coronagraph target for demonstrating the instrument's core requirement (TTR5) should motivate the timely, deep vetting of candidate reference stars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic White Dwarf - M Dwarf Binaries in Pre-mCV Phase as Special Population of Long-Period Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of coherent radio sources with periods ranging from minutes to hours. Recently, two LPT sources, ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37, with periods of 2-3 hours has been confirmed to originate from white dwarf (WD) -- M dwarf (MD) binaries. In this work, we propose that at least some LPTs originate from the magnetic WD -- MD binaries in the pre-magnetic cataclysmic variables (pre-mCV) phase. The asynchronism between the WD's rotation and the binary's orbital motion allows for the unipolar-inductor mechanism or magnetosphere interaction to operate and accelerate radiating particles, with the dominant process depending on the magnetic moment ratio of the two stars. Under asynchronism condition, both the peak flux and the polarization of radio pulses will be modulated by the beat period. The pre-mCV phase characterized by an extremely low accretion rate provides the relatively clean magnetospheric environment necessary for a loss-cone-driven maser (LCDM) mechanism to operate, producing the LPT emission. The observed pulse duty cycle of $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ is attributed to a beaming effect modulated by the binary's magnetic geometry. Furthermore, the magnetized environment of a WD--MD binary is conducive to Faraday conversion with weak coupling, which implies that the polarization state of LPTs should vary significantly at different periods. Finally, we predict that LPTs from WD--MD binaries should exhibit a period distribution following $f_P(P)dP \propto P^{(1.67-2.33)}dP$ and a luminosity function described by $f_L(L)dL \propto L^{-(1.80-2.67)}dL$, which can be tested by the future large sample.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Applicability of the Hartle-Thorne and Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu Methods for Modeling Rotating Neutron Stars</title>

Abstract: Neutron stars, which are composed of extremely dense nuclear matter, serve as natural laboratories to study nuclear interactions beyond the terrestrial experiments. Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $\Omega=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Hidden metallic iron in amorphous silicate dust? Insights from condensation experiments and mid-infrared spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amorphous silicate dust is a major component in the interstellar and circumstellar dust formed in the outflow of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Although iron depletion is observed in the interstellar medium (ISM), the exact form and fraction of iron in solid remains under debate. In particular, it is unclear whether amorphous silicate dust around AGB stars contains metallic iron. We aimed to provide optical constants of amorphous silicate nanoparticles and examine the effects of metallic iron on their spectral features to better constrain the dust properties by producing amorphous silicate nanoparticles with and without metallic cores. We performed condensation experiments using an induction thermal plasma system to produce dust analogues of the CI chondritic composition in the Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-Fe-Ni-O and Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-O systems. We measured the absorbance and reflectance of the samples, observed the structure of the products, and determined the optical constants. Two types of amorphous silicate nanoparticles (10-200 nm in diameter) with nearly CI chondritic composition were produced: one contained kamacite (Fe: Ni=0.9: 0.1) cores with a diameter ratio ranging 0-0.87 (average ~0.50), and the other was iron-free homogeneous amorphous silicate. The amorphous silicates of the CI chondritic composition with various sized metallic cores may be prevalent in circumstellar and interstellar dust.</description>

Abstract: We present the discovery of a superjovian planet around the young A5 star HIP 54515, detected using precision astrometry from the Hipparcos Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations and high-contrast imaging with SCExAO/CHARIS from the recently-commenced OASIS program. SCExAO/CHARIS detects HIP 54515 b in five epochs 0\farcs{}145--0\farcs{}192 from the star ($\sim$3--4 $\lambda$/D at 1.65 $\mu m$), exhibiting clockwise orbital motion. HIP 54515 b lies near the M/L transition with a luminosity of log(L/L$_{\rm \odot}$) $\sim$ -3.52 $\pm$ 0.03.
  Dynamical modeling constrains its mass and mass ratio to be ${17.7}_{-4.9}^{+7.6}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ and ${0.0090}_{-0.0024}^{+0.0036}$ and favors a $\sim$25 au semimajor axis. HIP 54515 b adds to a growing list of superjovian planets with moderate eccentricities (e $\approx$ 0.4). Now the third planet discovered from surveys combining high-contrast extreme adaptive optics imaging with precision astrometry, HIP 54515 b should help improve empirical constraints on the luminosity evolution and eccentricity distribution of the most massive planets. It may also provide a key technical test of the Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument's performance in the low stellar flux, small angular separation limit and a demonstration of its ability to yield constrainable planet spectral properties.</description>

      <title>JWST Exoplanetary Worlds and Elemental Survey (JEWELS) I: High-Precision Chemical Abundances of 20 FGK Planet-Hosting Stars from JWST Cycle 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high-precision chemical abundances for 20 FGK stars hosting planets observed in JWST Cycle 2 GO programs. Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500-6500 K and metallicities from -0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $\alpha$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.</description>
