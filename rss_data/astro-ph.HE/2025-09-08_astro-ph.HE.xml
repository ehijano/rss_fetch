      <title>The Landscape of Collapsar Outflows: Structure, Signatures and Origins of Einstein Probe Relativistic Supernova Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein Probe is revolutionizing time-domain astrophysics through the discovery of new classes of X-ray transients associated with Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae. These events commonly exhibit bright early-time optical counterparts, and sudden afterglow rebrightening within the first week - features that existing models fail to explain. In particular, structured jet and cocoon scenarios are inconsistent with the observed sharp rebrightening and multi-day optical emission, while the refreshed shock model is ruled out due to its inconsistency with collapsar hydrodynamics. Drawing on 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we present the multi-scale angular and radial structure characterizing collapsar outflows. The resulting morphology features episodic, wobbling jets with a "top-hat" geometry, embedded within a smoother global cocoon and disk ejecta angular structure. The wobbling jets give rise to variations in radiative efficiency that can account for the observed alternation between X-ray-dominated and $\gamma$-ray-dominated jet emission. The top-hat structure of individual wobbling jet episodes naturally explains the sudden rebrightening observed when the emission from the top-hat jet cores enters the observer's line of sight. The radial structure is consistent with that inferred from observations of stripped-envelope supernovae. It comprises a mildly relativistic cocoon ($0.3\lesssim\beta\Gamma\lesssim3$) that may power an early ($\sim1\,{\rm day}$) rapidly decaying emission, followed by slower, black hole accretion disk-driven outflows ($\beta\lesssim0.3$), which dominate the slowly evolving optical emission at $t\gtrsim1\,{\rm day}$. This novel multi-component outflow structure provides a unified explanation for the multiband light curves observed in Einstein Probe transients and is likely a common feature of Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae more broadly.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry of synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons with anisotropic pitch-angle and various energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons having a power-law energy distribution with a power-law index $p$ in an optically thin medium with a locally uniform magnetic field, it is generally adopted that the spectral index $\alpha = (p-1)/2$ and the degree of linear polarisation $\Pi_{\rm L,pl} = (p +1)/(p+7/3)$, and hence that $\Pi_{\rm L,pl} = (\alpha +1)/(\alpha+5/3)$. These ($\alpha$, $\Pi_{\rm L,pl}$; $p$) relations are derived assuming that the electrons have an isotropic momentum distribution and a power-law energy distribution, and they have been used, almost universally, in the interpretation of polarimetry observations. In this study, we assess the validity of the ($\alpha$, $\Pi_{\rm L,pl}$; $p$) relations in different scenarios, such as anisotropic electron momenta and non-power-law distributions of electron energy. We calculate the synchrotron radiation and polarisation spectra for power-law, kappa and log-parabola electron-energy distributions, with isotropic and two anisotropic (beamed and loss cone) electron-momentum distributions. Our calculations show that when the electron momenta are isotropic, the usual ($\alpha$, $\Pi_{\rm L,pl}$; $p$) relations are generally applicable. However, if the electrons are anisotropic, the usual ($\alpha$, $\Pi_{\rm L,pl}$; $p$) relations could break down. Applying the usual ($\alpha$, $\Pi_{\rm L,pl}$; $p$) relations indiscriminately without caution on anisotropy in the electron momentum distribution, would lead to incorrect interpretations of polarimetry data.</description>

      <title>Can "premature collapse" form black holes in the upper and lower mass gaps?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, including the recent signals GW231123 and GW230529, have revealed multiple progenitor black holes in the so-called upper and lower mass gaps, respectively. It is generally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass gap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt the stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum allowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in supernova explosions. Here we explore a "premature collapse" scenario in which upper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late stage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse is the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A similar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass gap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely result in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining the rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on several parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least in galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the upper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the lower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of blazar monitoring with the INAF radio telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme variability of blazars, in both timescale and amplitude, is generally explained as the effect of a relativistic jet closely aligned to the observer's line-of-sight. Due to causality arguments, variability characteristics translate into spatial information about the emitting region of blazars. Since radiation at different wavelengths is emitted in different parts of the jet, multi-frequency observations provide us with a virtual view of the structure of the jet on different scales. Radio--gamma-ray correlations, moreover, are essential to reveal where and how the high-energy radiation is produced. We present here the observations collected within the blazar radio monitoring program that we are running at the Medicina and Noto telescopes. It aims at investigating how the variability characteristics and spectral energy distribution of blazars evolve in time. Since 2004, observation have been performed at 5, 8, 24, and 43 GHz on 47 targets, with monthly cadence; the monitoring program is still active at frequencies of 8 and 24 GHz. The database we built in more than twenty years of activity comprises to date about 21000 flux density measurements. Some basic analysis tools have been applied to the data to characterise the detected variability and offer a first glance at the wealth of information that such a program can provide about blazars.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves reveal the pair-instability mass gap and constrain nuclear burning in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar evolution theory predicts that electron--positron pair production in the cores of massive stars triggers unstable thermonuclear explosions that prevent the direct formation of black holes above about $50\,M_\odot$, creating a ``pair-instability gap''. Yet black holes have been detected above this mass with gravitational waves; such objects might be explained with uncertainties in the physics of massive stars and stellar collapse or with hierarchical mergers of black holes in stellar clusters. Hierarchical mergers are associated with large spins as predicted by general relativity, and isotropic spin orientations. Here we present strong evidence for the pair-instability mass gap in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA fourth transient catalog, with a lower edge at $45.3^{+6.5}_{-4.8}\,M_\odot$. We also obtain a measurement of the ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma){}^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, yielding an $S$-factor of $242.5^{+310.4}_{-101.5}\,\mathrm{keV\,b}$, a parameter critical for modeling helium burning and stellar evolution. The new data reveal two populations: a low-spin group with no black holes above the gap, consistent with direct stellar collapse, and a high-spin, isotropic group that extends across the full mass range and occupies the gap, consistent with hierarchical mergers. These findings confirm the role of pair-instability in shaping the black hole spectrum, establish a new link between gravitational-wave astronomy and nuclear astrophysics, and highlight hierarchical mergers and star cluster dynamics as key channels in the growth of black holes.</description>

      <title>Do both black holes spin in merging binaries? Evidence from GWTC-4 and astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular momentum transport in high-mass stars is commonly modeled by extrapolating the behavior of better-observed low-mass stars. According to the conventional picture, the cores of most black hole progenitors lose almost all of their angular momentum when their outer layers are ejected before core collapse. Accordingly, most black holes are expected to be born with dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$, even if some black holes are born with non-negligible spin due to tidal interactions in a progenitor binary. One might therefore expect to find a large fraction of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$ black holes in merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. We find that the conventional picture of angular momentum transport is in tension with data from LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog. We find no support for a sub-population of BBH systems with $\chi \lesssim 0.01$. Neither do we find support for a sub-population with only one spinning black hole as expected for tidal spin-up scenarios. Instead, we find evidence for two subpopulations in which both black holes have non-negligible spin. Approximately 84% of BBH systems contain two black holes with modest spins $\chi \approx 0.1$ and approximately 16% contain two black holes with large spins $\chi \approx 0.8$. These estimates come from our best-fit model, which is favored with natural log Bayes factors $\ln B \gtrsim 3$ over models that require a sub-population of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$ black holes, and models that do not contain multiple spin sub-populations. These results are difficult to reconcile with our current understanding of angular momentum transport.</description>

      <title>SN 2022acko and the Properties of its Red Supergiant Progenitor: Direct Detection, Light Curves, and Nebular Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared observations of the Type II-P supernova SN 2022acko in NGC 1300, located at a distance of 19.0 +/- 2.9 Mpc. Our dataset spans 1-350 days post-explosion in photometry, complemented by late-time optical spectroscopy covering 200-600 days, and includes deep pre-explosion imaging. We use this extensive multiwavelength dataset for both direct and indirect constraints on the progenitor system. Using the early-time photometry and shock-cooling models, we infer that SN 2022acko likely originated from a red supergiant with a radius of R ~ 580 solar radii and an initial mass of M ~ 9-10 solar masses. From the radioactive decay tail, we infer a synthesized Ni56 mass of 0.014 +/- 0.004 solar masses. We further model nebular-phase spectra using radiative transfer models and nucleosynthesis yields for core-collapse supernovae, which suggest a progenitor initial mass in the range of 10-15 solar masses. Meanwhile, blackbody fitting of the detected pre-explosion counterpart in the F814W and F160W bands indicates a red supergiant with a lower initial mass of approximately 7.5 solar masses. The light curve exhibits a 116 days plateau, indicative of a massive hydrogen-rich envelope, inconsistent with the pre-explosion analysis. We investigated the discrepancy between direct and indirect progenitor mass estimates, focusing on the roles of binary interaction, early-time modeling limitations, and systematic uncertainties in spectral calibration. Our results indicate that the tension among mass estimates likely arises from modeling limitations and flux calibration uncertainties rather than from insufficient data, highlighting the need for more physically realistic models and a deeper understanding of systematic effects.</description>

      <title>Attributing the supernova remnant RCW 89 to the jittering jets explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine recent radio observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 89 and identify a point-symmetric morphology composed of two main symmetry axes. I attribute this morphology to a jet-driven explosion in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). To reach this conclusion, I argue that the MSH 15-52 nebula associated with the pulsar PSR B1509-58, the X-ray hand-like-shaped nebula, and RCW 89 are two separate core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants that interact with each other. Namely, the nebula SNR G320.4-1.2 contains two CCSN remnants. In essence, I utilize the recent successes of the JJEM to account for the morphologies of point-symmetric CCSN remnants, thereby explaining the morphology of RCW 89 and identifying it as a separate CCSN remnant. I suggest a process by which somewhat more energetic pairs of jets in the JJEM have a positive feedback on the accreted gas onto the newly born neutron star, thereby prolonging the life of the jets and explaining the occurrence of two or three energetic pairs of jets in some CCSNe. This study adds RCW 89 to the growing list of point-symmetric CCSN remnants. The JJEM naturally explains these morphologies as shaped by misaligned pairs of jets that exploded these CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Influence of Dark Matter on Hybrid and Twin Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) on both hybrid and twin stars within a two-fluid framework, where DM and normal matter interact only through gravity. A self-interacting fermionic DM model is considered, while for nucleonic and quark matter we employ the relativistic mean-field model and the constant sound-speed parametrization, respectively. Our results show that DM significantly influences the formation of hybrid and twin stars, depending on the transition pressure and the discontinuity in energy density at a fixed sound speed. The presence of DM reduces the number of twin or hybrid stars compared to the case without DM, and this effect directly depends on the DM mass and fraction. We further find that the formation of DM-core or DM-halo configurations is mainly governed by DM parameters, whereas the realization of twin or hybrid star scenarios is primarily controlled by quark parameters. Using the $2M_\odot$ constraint, we demonstrate that the parameter space for twin stars can be further restricted in both DM-core and DM-halo scenarios.</description>

      <title>Latest results from the searches for ultra-high-energy photons at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest air-shower detector in the world, offering unparalleled exposure to photons with energies above $5 \times 10^{16}$ eV. Since the start of data collection almost two decades ago, numerous searches for photons have been conducted using the detection systems of the Observatory. These searches have led to the most stringent upper limits on the diffuse photon flux. These limits place severe constraints on current models regarding the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and emphasize the significant capabilities of the Pierre Auger Observatory in the context of multimessenger astronomy at the highest energies. This contribution provides an overview of the ongoing efforts to search for high-energy photons in the data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. The latest results from searches for the diffuse photon flux will be presented, along with follow-up investigations for photons associated with transient events, such as gravitational wave detections. Furthermore, future prospects will be discussed in light of the ongoing AugerPrime detector upgrade, which will enhance the sensitivity of the Observatory to photons up to the highest energies.</description>

      <title>A milliarcsecond localization associates FRB 20190417A with a compact, luminous persistent radio source and an extreme magneto-ionic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the milliarcsecond localization of a high (1379 pc/cc) dispersion measure (DM) repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20190417A. Combining European VLBI Network detections of five repeat bursts, we confirm the FRB's host to be a low-metallicity, star-forming dwarf galaxy at z = 0.12817, analogous to the hosts of FRBs 20121102A, 20190520B and 20240114A. We also show that FRB 20190417A is spatially coincident with a compact, luminous persistent radio source (PRS). Visibility-domain model fitting constrains the transverse physical size of the PRS to &lt; 23.1 pc and yields an integrated flux density of 191(39) microJy at 1.4 GHz. Though we do not find significant evidence for DM evolution, FRB 20190417A exhibits a time-variable rotation measure (RM) ranging between +3958(11) and +5061(24) rad/m2 over three years. We find no evidence for intervening galaxy clusters in the FRB's line-of-sight and place a conservative lower limit on the rest-frame host DM contribution of 1212.0 pc/cc (90% confidence) -- the largest known for any FRB so far. This system strengthens the emerging picture of a rare subclass of repeating FRBs with large and variable RMs, above-average host DMs, and luminous PRS counterparts in metal-poor dwarf galaxies. We explore the role of these systems in the broader FRB population, either as the youngest or most extreme FRB sources, or as a distinct engine for FRB emission.</description>

Redbacks are compact binaries in which a rotation-powered millisecond pulsar interacts with a non-degenerate companion via an intrabinary shock, forming ideal laboratories for probing pulsar winds and relativistic shock physics, where ordered magnetic fields and particle acceleration shape the observed radiation. We conduct a spectro-polarimetric analysis combining IXPE data with archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift observations. We explore two limiting magnetic field configurations, parallel and perpendicular to the bulk flow, and simulate their expected polarization signatures using the {\tt 3DPol} radiative transport code. To account for the rapid rotation of the polarization angle predicted by these models, we implement a phase-dependent Stokes alignment procedure that preserves the polarization degree while correcting for phase-rotating PA. We also devise a new maximum-likelihood fitting strategy to determine the phase-dependence of the polarization angle by minimizing the polarization degree uncertainty. This technique shows a hint the binary may be rotating clockwise relative to the celestial north pole. We find no significant detection of polarization in the IXPE data, with PD&lt;51% at 99% confidence level. Our results excludes the high-polarization degree scenario predicted by the perpendicular field model during the brightest orbital phase bin. Simulations show that doubling the current exposure would make the parallel configuration detectable. The new PA rotation technique is also applicable to IXPE data of many sources whose intrinsic PA variation is apriori not known but is strictly periodic.</description>

Abstract: A handful of enigmatic Jupiter-mass objects have been discovered orbiting pulsars. One such object, PSR J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter exoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium temperature. We use JWST to observe its emission spectrum across an entire orbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong westward winds. Our observations open up a new exoplanetary chemical regime (ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of &gt;100 and &gt;10,000 respectively) and dynamical regime (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study. The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of "black widow" companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.</description>

      <title>X-ray investigation of possible super-Eddington accretion in a radio-loud quasar at $z=6.13$</title>

Abstract: We present radio and X-ray observations of the recently discovered $z=6.13$ radio-powerful quasar RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 using uGMRT, ATCA, LBA, and Chandra. The observed radio properties are in line with what is typically observed in high-$z$ radio quasars ($\alpha_{\rm r}=0.72\pm 0.02$ and L$_{\rm 1.4GHz}=5.8 \pm 0.9 \times 10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). Despite the relatively low X-ray flux observed $F_{\rm 0.5-7.0 keV}=2.3\pm0.5 \times 10^{-14}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, the intrinsic luminosity in the 2-10 keV rest frame is markedly high, $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}=1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7} \times 10^{46}$ erg sec$^{-1}$, making RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 one of the most luminous quasars currently known at $z&gt;5.5$. The high X-ray luminosity is largely driven by an extrapolation to energies below the observable X-ray window with Chandra and the slope derived in the 0.5-7 keV band (or 3.5--50 keV in the rest-frame; $\Gamma_{\rm X}=3.3\pm0.4$). By analysing the overall spectral energy distribution of the quasar we found that the remarkably soft X-ray emission: (1) cannot be produced by relativistic jets, even when relativistic boosting is considered; and (2) is consistent with expectations for a super-Eddington accreting SMBH. If such a high accretion rate was confirmed, this source would be a unique laboratory to study high accretion in the early Universe and could help resolve some challenges inherent in early black hole growth paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) \hii\ imaging of NGC\,4141, the host galaxy of FRB\,20250316A at $z=0.0063$. Our GMRT \hii\ images have spatial resolutions, at $z\approx0.0063$, of $\approx0.48-8.0$~kpc, and find evidence for (i)~a companion galaxy, LEDA\,2582852, to the south-west, (ii)~a nearby (27-kpc distant) H{\sc{i}} cloud to the south-west, (iii)~disturbances in the H{\sc{i}} distributions of both NGC\,4141 and LEDA\,2582852, and (iv)~high H{\sc{i}} column densities in the south-western outskirts of NGC\,4141. A Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum shows evidence for a low metallicity and a high star-formation rate (SFR) surface density activity in the south-western disk of NGC\,4141, while H$\alpha$-based SFR estimates over the last 10~Myr are higher than radio-based SFRs over the last 100~Myr. The above evidence indicates that NGC\,4141 has recently acquired metal-poor gas, via either a merger or accretion, that resulted in the south-western starburst and that may have also triggered large-scale star-formation activity in NGC\,4141, resulting in the formation of the stellar progenitor of FRB\,20250316A and the other transients. Our highest-resolution (480~pc) GMRT H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm image finds no H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission from the location of FRB\,20250316A or the nearby star-forming region, suggesting that most of the H{\sc{i}} here has been either ionized or converted into the molecular phase. Our non-detection of continuum emission at the location of FRB\,20250316A yields the $3\sigma$ upper limit $&lt;3.2\times10^{25}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$, on the 1.4~GHz specific luminosity of a putative persistent radio source associated with FRB\,20250316A, one of the strongest constraints on the radio luminosity of such an associated persistent radio source.</description>

      <title>Measuring the properties of homogeneous turbulence in curved spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence in curved spacetimes in general, and in the vicinity of black holes (BHs) in particular, represents a poorly understood phenomenon that is often analysed employing techniques developed for flat spacetimes. We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Results and plans to apply interferometry to air shower observations at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analysing the radio emissions from air showers using interferometry, we can estimate their properties. In this contribution, we apply interferometry to reconstruct air-shower parameters based on measurements taken with the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) at the Pierre Auger Observatory. This reconstruction method is achievable at AERA through precise clock synchronisation with a beacon and an accurate survey of the station locations. Interferometry has been applied to several thousand inclined air-shower observations for the first time, which allows for tests on the performance of air-shower geometry reconstruction, recovery of the radio signal from low-energy air showers, and methods to study the polarisation of the radio-emission mechanisms. Additionally, in this contribution, we will also provide an overview of efforts to enable interferometry for the recently installed radio detectors that are part of the AugerPrime upgrade.</description>

      <title>Deep polarimetry study reveals double ring ORC-like structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New observations with the current generation of advanced radio interferometers, such as ASKAP and MeerKAT, have led to the discovery of new classes of extended radio sources of unknown origin, including the so-called Odd Radio Circles (ORCs). These phenomena are detected exclusively in the radio continuum, with no clear counterparts at other wavelengths, making their physical nature and origin a subject of ongoing investigation. To better understand these objects, we study their radio continuum emission, spectral characteristics, and magnetic field properties. In this work, we present a radio spectropolarimetry analysis of a newly discovered ORC (ORC J0356-4216) that exhibits a rare double-ring morphology. We use data from the MeerKAT L-band and from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) at 943 MHz. ORC J0356-4216 shows a symmetric double-ring structure with a diameter of approximately 2 arcminutes, corresponding to a physical size of 668 kpc based on the redshift ($0.494 \pm 0.068$) of its apparent host galaxy WISEA J035609.67-421603.5. The radio spectra of both rings are steep, with spectral indices of $-1.18 \pm 0.03$ and $-1.12 \pm 0.05$, and show no significant substructure. Equipartition magnetic field strengths (assuming K0 = 1) are estimated to be 1.82 microGauss and 1.65 microGauss for the respective rings. The degree of polarisation across the object ranges between 20-30%, consistent with a non-thermal synchrotron origin. The morphology and polarisation are broadly consistent with large-scale shocks driven by powerful starburst outflows. However, the high degree of symmetry, the coherent double-ring structure, and the absence of internal substructure are features commonly associated with relic AGN lobes, making this scenario particularly compatible with the observed characteristics.</description>

      <title>The pre-eruption state of T CrB as observed with ALMA in 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T CrB is a nearby symbiotic binary and a recurrent nova with a period of ca. 80 years. The next eruption is expected to take place in 2025 or 2026. We present our pre-eruption observations made in ALMA frequency Bands 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 in August to November 2024 and constrain the properties of the environment into which the imminent next nova will erupt.
  We find that in the second half of 2024, the quiescent T CrB was a faint mm source with a spectral energy distribution well described by a powerlaw with index $\alpha=$0.56$\pm$0.11 and a flux density of ca. 0.1 mJy at 44 GHz and 0.4 mJy at 400 GHz. There is no significant line emission. This is in agreement with expectations for free-free emission from the partially ionized wind of the red giant donor star and, in extrapolation to 35 GHz, a factor 5 fainter than the emission observed in 2016/17 during the latest high state. Comparing the spectra from that high-state between 13.5 GHz and 35 GHz with our spectrum from 2024, our spectrum is softer. The spectral index is on average lower by 0.34$\pm$0.11 . Our per-band and aggregate bandwidth images of T CrB show an unresolved point source with no evidence for extended structure.
  A simple model of a free-free emitting, fully-ionized stellar wind seems to describe well the 2016/17 high state of T CrB but not our 2024 ALMA measurements with their low flux and high turnover frequency suggesting that in 2024, the wind was far from fully ionized.

      <title>Identification of recurrent novae from parametric modeling of the optical light curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novae, characterized by sudden brightening in binary star systems, are categorized into classical novae (CNe) and recurrent novae (RNe) based on their recurrence timescales. However, identifying RNe, which occur within 100 years, presents observational challenges. A reasonable signature of RNe has been theorized and statistically validated to address this -- the presence of a plateau in the optical light curve. Among the known RNe, except T CrB and V3890 Sgr displaying S-class light curve, the rest 9 out of 11 have a P-class light curve. But classical novae can also present plateaus, which further complicates the problem of distinguishing CNe from RNe just based on plateau. Hence, in this study, we aim to conduct a phenomenological analysis of P-class light curves to comment on the recurrence nature of novae. We utilize data primarily from the AAVSO database and identify a parameter space to represent all P-class light curves, anticipating distinct parameter distributions for CNe and RNe. Analysis of parameter distributions successfully distinguishes RNe from CNe and reveals potential connections with white dwarf mass and mass accretion rate, which are the key factors. Our method indicates KT Eri to be a recurrent nova, consistent with a recent study, despite only one observed outburst. The analysis also indicates the possibility of recurrence for V2860 Ori, a prediction that may be tested by deep search for nova super-remnant for this source. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of distinguishing P-class classical and recurrent novae based solely on the optical light curve. As observations of new novae increase, this method holds promise for more precise predictions of nova recurrence nature in the future.</description>

      <title>Reading signatures of supermassive binary black holes in pulsar timing array observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the inferred properties of the putative gravitational wave background in the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array to be in better agreement with theoretical expectations under the improved noise model. In particular, our improved noise models show consistency of the background's strain spectral index with the value of -2/3, favoring the population of supermassive black hole binaries as the origin of the background. Our results further suggest that the observed gravitational wave emission is the dominant source of the binary energy loss, with no evidence of environmental effects or eccentric orbits. At the reference gravitational wave frequency of yr$^{-1}$, we also find a lower power-law strain amplitude of the background than in previous data analyses. This mitigates some of the tensions of the strain amplitude with the expected number density and mass scale of binaries discussed in the literature. However, we show that it is mostly affected by strong covariance of the amplitude and the strain spectral index at yr$^{-1}$, whereas the strain amplitude at 0.1 yr$^{-1}$ and the strain amplitude at yr$^{-1}$ assuming a fixed spectral index of -2/3 remains unaffected. Our results highlight the importance of accurate noise models for correctly inferring properties of the gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>511 keV Galactic Photons from a Dark Matter Spike</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that a dark matter (DM) spike around the Galactic Center's (GC) supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, could account for most of the bulge's measured 511 keV line intensity while remaining cosmologically compatible. DM annihilation can be the primary source of the 511 keV line emission without violating constraints from disk emission observations and in-flight positron annihilation with the interstellar medium, provided the disk emission is dominated by an astrophysical source of low-energy positrons. We find that a DM mass up to approximately 20 MeV, either with a Gondolo-Silk spike or one softened by stellar heating, could explain the observed 511 keV bulge emission profile. Our proposal can be tested by future observations of the continuum diffuse emission close to the GC.</description>

      <title>Signatures of magnetic flux expulsion from neutron star cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shortly after a neutron star is born, the protons in its core begin to form a superconductor. In terrestrial materials, the hallmark of superconductivity is an associated expulsion of magnetic flux, but whether this expulsion process can be effective in neutron stars remains an open question -- one with major implications for the phenomenology of pulsars and magnetars. Earlier theoretical arguments suggested flux must be trapped within the core, yet models of magnetars rely on it being expelled from the core and confined to the crust, where it can evolve on kyr timescales. We show that if expulsion is not complete, a qualitatively new evolutionary branch for neutron stars arises, which can account for the properties of newly discovered long-period radio transients and fast radio bursts in older environments. One recently proposed model that could create such field topologies has additional implications for gravitational wave emission and predicts a characteristic energy release that, if observed, will corroborate the role of reconnection at the onset of superconductivity and can constrain the superconducting proton gap.</description>

Abstract: Pulsars, highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars, can have significant muon abundances in their dense cores, making them promising environments to probe ultralight mediators coupled to muons. The precise measurement of periastron advance in binary pulsar systems provides a sensitive probe of such long-range forces. In this work, we study the periastron advance constraints from binary pulsar systems on the ultralight muonic mediators. We compute the muon number fraction in neutron stars, by properly taking into account the suppression effect of the long-range muonic force. We find that the periastron advance constraints impose the most stringent constraints on ultralight muonic mediators in the mass range of $\simeq(10^{-17},\,2\times10^{-15})$ eV, probing muonic couplings as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-21})$, which surpass the limits from LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave measurements, by about an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Extreme Jet Beaming Observed in Neutrino-Associated Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bright blazars were found to be prominent neutrino sources, and a number of IceCube events were associated with them over recent years. A particularly strong observational connection is present between neutrinos and blazars with bright, Doppler-boosted, parsec-scale radio emission. In this work, we further explore the nature of this connection by examining the jet geometry and kinematics of neutrino-associated blazars. We find that these blazars demonstrate remarkably strong jet beaming, even compared to other radio-bright sources. Their Doppler and Lorentz factors are larger, and viewing angles are smaller than for other blazars in the complete uniformly selected MOJAVE sample. Observationally, this serves as yet another piece of evidence for blazars forming a major population of neutrino sources. The strong neutrino-beaming correlation indicates that high-energy neutrino velocity is predominantly oriented along the jet, and the original PeV-scale protons exhibit a relativistic bulk motion along the jet. It suggests that neutrino production happens not too close to the black hole, but rather at sub-parsec distances, where the jet is already accelerated.</description>

      <title>SpiderCat: A Catalog of Compact Binary Millisecond Pulsars</title>

Abstract: We present SpiderCat, a multi-wavelength catalog of all publicly known compact binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the Galactic field. These systems, colloquially known as "spiders", consist of neutron stars in tight orbits with low-mass companions, which are gradually ablated by the pulsar wind. SpiderCat includes both primary subclasses $-$ redbacks and black widows $-$ distinguished by companion mass, as well as candidates and peculiar systems such as transitional, huntsman and tidarren MSPs. As of this initial release, SpiderCat contains 111 entries: 30 redbacks, 50 black widows, 2 huntsmans, 23 redback candidates, 5 black widow candidates, and 1 huntsman candidate.
  In this paper, we compile and summarize key parameters for each system, including spin and orbital properties, and multi-wavelength data from radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray observations. An interactive, publicly accessible web interface (https://astro.phys.ntnu.no/SpiderCAT) enables exploration and visualization of the data.
  The rapid growth of the number of known spiders, accelerated by the Fermi-LAT survey and its ability to identify MSPs in $\gamma$-rays, has opened the door to population-level studies. Utilizing SpiderCat, we analyze trends in spin period, orbital period, companion mass, emission properties, and spatial distribution. SpiderCat serves as a dynamic, multi-wavelength repository for this unique class of binary pulsars, facilitating new discoveries and constraints on pulsar evolution, particle acceleration, and the neutron star equation of state.</description>

      <title>GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and astrophysical implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.</description>

      <title>Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and future challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Measuring the Pion-Air Cross Section at Multi-TeV Energies Using Muon Bundle Properties in Deep Underground Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction cross section of charged pions with air nuclei is a critical parameter for accurately simulating extensive air showers. Improving the modeling of high-energy pion interactions is essential for addressing the muon puzzle-the observed deficit of muons in simulations compared to indirect experimental estimates. As collider experiments cannot directly probe these interactions, we propose a novel measurement approach using muon bundles detected in deep-underground water Cherenkov detectors, such as IceCube and KM3NeT. This method aims to constrain the pion-air inelastic cross section, thereby reducing uncertainties in air shower simulations and advancing our understanding of cosmic ray interactions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Pipeline for the Identification of New Gamma-Ray Blazars from the 4FGL-Xiang Catalog Based on Multi-wavelength Flux Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification and classification of Fermi blazars are core topics in high-energy astrophysics. To enable precise spatial cross-identification, we constructed two high-precision catalogs: the updated 4FGL-Xiang-DR2 (DR2) and a supplementary version of the fifth edition of Roma-BZCAT (\texttt{5BZCAT\_err}). We then developed and applied a novel four-step analytical pipeline combining cross-matching with the statistical analysis of multi-band flux distributions to identify new Fermi blazars. The analytical pipeline has yielded several key results in the systematic comparison of BZBs and BZQs. We found that among single statistical metrics, kurtosis is the most powerful discriminator (MAD~$&gt;$~1.64). At the overall distribution level, the 1.4~GHz, 843~MHz, 5~GHz, 0.1--2.4~keV, and 0.3--10~keV bands show significant divergence (JSD~$&gt;$~0.3). Building on these findings, our proposed ``Box-Cox$+$TND'' model successfully fits the observed flux distributions between BZBs and BZQs. Applying this entire pipeline, we successfully identified 17 new blazars. The validity of these associations is strongly supported by our multi-wavelength flux model, which confirms that 15 of the 17 candidates are statistically consistent with the known blazar population, falling within the $2\sigma$ confidence interval. Although the two remaining sources exhibit some statistical deviation in the gamma-ray band, their strong consistency in other wavebands, coupled with high spatial association probabilities, leads us to conclude that their associations are also reliable and should not be readily excluded.</description>

      <title>Imaging the positron annihilation line with 20-year INTEGRAL/SPI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The e$^+$ e$^-$ annihilation line at 511 keV provides a unique probe for studying the distribution and origin of positrons in our Galaxy. The SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL has observed this gamma-ray line for two decades. We analyze 20 years of INTEGRAL/SPI observations to produce the most sensitive all-sky map of the 511 keV line emission to date, aiming to reveal new features and provide refined measurements of known sources. We perform image deconvolution using the RL algorithm and employ bootstrap analysis to evaluate statistical uncertainties of fluxes from regions of interest. Systematic uncertainties in parameter choices are also considered. We utilize GPU acceleration to enable this computationally intensive analysis. The reconstructed image successfully recovers the basic morphological features reported in model-fitting studies: a bright central component, a broad bulge, and an elongated disk component along the Galactic plane. We also report hints of new spatial features in the reconstructed image, including an asymmetric structure in the broad bulge emission and 511 keV emission potentially associated with massive stars from the Sco-Cen and other OB associations. While the significance of these new features is marginal ($\sim 2\sigma$), they are spatially consistent with $^{26}$Al emission from massive stars in that region, suggesting that this 511 keV emission originates from its $\beta^{+}$ decay. Our 20-year dataset provides the most detailed 511 keV emission map to date, reproducing global structures suggested in model-fitting approach while revealing hints of new spatial features. These findings provide insights into the origin of Galactic positrons and propagation of low-energy positrons in the interstellar medium. Future MeV gamma-ray observations, such as COSI, are expected to confirm the reported features and shed further light on the nature of positrons in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous explanation of XTE J1814-338 and HESS J1731-347 objects using ${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K}^{0}}$ condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the compact star XTE J1814-338 with a mass of $M=1.2^{+0.05}_{-0.05}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=7^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km, together with the HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, shows they provide evidence for the possible presence of exotic matter in the core of neutron stars and significantly enhance our understanding of the equation of state for the dense nuclear matter. In the present study, we investigate the possible existence of negative charged kaons and neutral anti-kaons in neutron stars by employing the relativistic mean field model with first order kaonic (${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K}^{0}}$) condensates. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the XTE J1814-338 object and at the same time the HESS J1731-347 object, using a mixture of kaons condensation in dense nuclear matter. In addition, we compare our analysis approach with the recent observation of PSR J0437-4715 and PSR J1231-1411 pulsars, proposing that to simultaneously explain the current variety of astrophysical objects, it is essential to resurrect a scenario of two distinct branches, each corresponding to a different composition of nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into a generic static black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nontrivial extension of the problem of spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into the standard Schwarzschild black hole. This extension consists of replacing the Schwarzschild black hole by generic static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes with the aim of studying the effects of either modified gravitational theories beyond Einstein gravity or matter sources coupled to general relativity on the accretion process. This generalization also allows us to investigate the accretion into other types of black hole spacetimes, such as ones inspired by loop quantum gravity and string theory. To do so, we take into account a large class of static and spherically symmetric black holes whose spacetime is asymptotically flat with a positive total mass, has a regular Killing horizon, and satisfies appropriate monotonicity conditions of the metric functions. We provide the most general solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation on such spacetimes by expressing the one-particle distribution function in terms of suitable symplectic coordinates on the cotangent bundle, and we calculate the relevant observables, such as particle current density and energy-momentum-stress tensor. Specializing to the case where the gas is described by an isotropic ideal fluid at rest at infinity, we compute the mass accretion rate and compression ratio, and we show that the tangential pressure is larger than the radial one at the horizon, indicating that the behavior of a collisionless gas is different from the one of an isotropic perfect fluid. As an example, we apply our generic formulae to two special black hole spacetimes, namely the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and a loop quantum corrected black hole. We explore the effects of the free parameters on the observables and accretion rate, and we compare the results with those corresponding to the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Machine Learning Driven Tools for Detecting Millimeter Sources in Timestream Pre-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new pipeline utilizing machine learning for classifying short-duration features in raw time-ordered data (TOD) of cosmic microwave background survey observations. The pipeline, specifically designed for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, works in conjunction with the previous TOD preprocessing techniques that employ statistical thresholding to indiscriminately remove all large spikes in the data, whether they are due to noise features, cosmic rays, or true astrophysical sources, in a process called ``data cuts". This has the undesirable effect of excising real astrophysical sources, including transients, from the data. The classification pipeline demonstrated in this work uses the output from these data cuts and is able to differentiate between electronic noise, cosmic rays, and point sources, enabling the removal of undesired signals while retaining true astrophysical signals during TOD preprocessing. We achieve an overall accuracy of 90\% in categorizing data spikes of different origin and, importantly, 94\% for identifying those caused by astrophysical sources. Our pipeline also measures the amplitude of any detected source seen more than once and produces a subminute-to-minute light curve, providing information on its short timescale variability. This automated pipeline for source detection and amplitude estimation will be particularly useful for upcoming surveys with large data volumes, such as the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a New $\beta$-Scaling of the Tearing Instability in Weakly Collisional Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the linear tearing instability in weakly collisional plasmas using a non-ideal gyrotropic-MHD framework, uncovering a previously unknown scaling relation for the instability growth rate in high-$\beta$ environments. Even starting from an isotropic equilibrium, our analysis reveals a $\beta$-dependence, with the maximum growth rate scaling as $\sigma_\mathrm{max} \tau_a \propto \beta^{-1/4}$, challenging the long-held assumption of $\beta$-independence inherent in classical MHD formulations. This novel scaling emerges due to self-consistent fluctuations in pressure anisotropy, dynamically induced by perturbations in velocity and magnetic fields. Increasing plasma-$\beta$ always suppresses the instability, whereas a background pressure anisotropy can either enhance or further suppress it, depending on its sign: for $p_{\parallel,0} &lt; p_{\perp,0}$ the instability is strengthened, while for $p_{\parallel,0} &gt; p_{\perp,0}$ it is weakened. Importantly, this effect is not limited to low-collisionality plasmas at high $\beta$; it can also manifest in more collisional environments once the strict assumption of pressure isotropy is relaxed. This finding has profound implications for various astrophysical contexts characterized by high $\beta$ and varying degrees of collisionality, including the solar corona and heliospheric current sheets, planetary magnetospheres, as probed by space missions, and the intracluster medium, where magnetic reconnection critically impacts magnetic field evolution and cosmic ray transport. Our results therefore question the universality of the widely-accepted plasmoid-mediated fast reconnection paradigm and underscore the necessity of incorporating pressure anisotropy effects into reconnection models for accurate representation of astrophysical plasmas.</description>
