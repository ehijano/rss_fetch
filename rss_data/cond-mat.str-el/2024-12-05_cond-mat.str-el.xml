      <title>Mixed-state phase transitions in spin-Holstein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding coupled electron-phonon systems is one of the fundamental issues in strongly correlated systems. In this work, we aim to extend the notion of mixed-state phases to the realm of coupled electron/spinphonon systems. Specifically, we consider a two-dimensional cluster Hamiltonian locally coupled to a set of single bosonic modes with arbitrary coupling strength. First, we adopt a pure-state framework and examine whether a ground state phase transition out of the symmetry-protected topological phase can be captured using the standard polaron unitary transformation. This approach involves restricting the analysis to the low-energy manifold of the phonon degrees of freedom. We find that the pure-state approach fails to detect the anticipated transition to a topologically trivial phase at strong spin-phonon coupling. Next, we turn to a mixed-state picture. Here, we analyze mixed states of the model obtained by tracing out the phonons degrees of freedom. We employ two distinct diagnostics for mixed-state phase transitions: (i) the von Neumann conditional mutual information (CMI) and (ii) the R\'enyi-2 CMI. We argue that both measures detect signatures of mixed-state phase transitions, albeit at different critical spin-phonon coupling strengths, corresponding to subtly distinct notions of the mixed-state phases.</description>

      <title>Intertwined order of generalized global symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of generalized global symmetries in 2+1 dimensions by introducing a lattice model that couples a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model to a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory via a topological interaction. This coupling binds the charges of one symmetry to the disorder operators of the other, and when these composite objects condense, they give rise to emergent generalized symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies. These anomalies result in phases with ordinary symmetry breaking, topological order, and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, where the different types of order are not independent but intimately related. We further explore the gapped boundary states of these exotic phases and develop theories for phase transitions between them. Additionally, we extend our lattice model to incorporate a non-invertible global symmetry, which can be spontaneously broken, leading to domain walls with non-trivial fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Interaction effects in quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry provides important information about the structure and topology of quantum states in various forms of quantum matter. The information contained therein has profound effects on observable quantities such as superconducting weight, Drude weight, and optical responses. Motivated by the recent advances in flat-band interacting systems, we investigate the role of interaction effects on the quantum metric. By using the fermionic Creutz ladder as a representative system, we show that the repulsive Hubbard interaction monotonically suppresses the quantum metric. While the eigenstates and their overlap quantifying the quantum metric can be obtained exactly in the presence of interactions through exact diagonalization, this method is limited to small system sizes. Alternatively, two theoretical proposals, the generalized quantum metric and the dressed quantum metric, suggest using renormalized Green's functions to define the interacting quantum metric. By comparing these analytical approaches with results from exact diagonalization, we show that the dressed quantum metric provides a better fit to the exact diagonalization results. Our conclusion holds for both flat-band and dispersive systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast giant enhancement of second harmonic generation through level occupation engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical nonlinearity, especially the second harmonic generation (SHG), is generally weak in materials but has the potential to be applied in high-speed optical computers and energy-efficient artificial intelligence systems. In order to program such photonic circuits, electrical and all-optical modulation mechanisms of optical nonlinearity have been proposed. Among them the electrical methods are bottlenecked by speed, while optical methods like Floquet engineering provides a fast heat-free route, but has only been experimentally shown to suppress SHG. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrated an ultrafast enhancement of SHG by 40% on a timescale of $\sim$ 500 femtosecond in van der Waals NiPS$_3$. We performed single-ion model calculations to show that by optically control the electron occupation of different energy levels, the SHG can be enhanced due to different electronic states involved in the SHG process. We then performed temperature-dependent time-resolved measurements in both linear and nonlinear optics, which confirm our calculations. We also discussed the implications for other materials in the transition metal thiophosphates (MPX$_3$) family.</description>

      <title>Hundness in twisted bilayer graphene: correlated gaps and pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize gap-opening mechanisms in the topological heavy fermion (THF) model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), with and without electron-phonon coupling, using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with the numerical renormalization group (NRG) impurity solver. In the presence of symmetry breaking associated with valley-orbital ordering (time-reversal-symmetric or Kramers intervalley coherent, or valley polarized), spin anti-Hund and orbital-angular-momentum Hund couplings, induced by the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect, result in a robust pseudogap at filling $2 \lesssim |\nu| \lesssim 2.5$. We also find that Hundness enhances the pairing susceptibilities for $1.6 \lesssim |\nu| \lesssim 2.8$, which might be a precursor to the superconducting phases neighboring $|\nu| = 2$.</description>

      <title>Successive magnetic transitions in the spin-5/2 easy-axis triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$: A neutron diffraction study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of various exotic quantum states in the equilateral triangular-lattice phosphates Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ with $J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2 and Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$ with $S$ = 1, the magnetic properties of spin-5/2 antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$, their classical counterpart, are comprehensively investigated experimentally. DC magnetization and specific heat measurements on polycrystalline samples indicate two successive magnetic transitions at $T\rm_{N1}$ $\approx$ 1.13 K and $T\rm_{N2}$ $\approx$ 1.28 K, respectively. Zero-field neutron powder diffraction measurement at 67 mK reveals a Y-like spin configuration as its ground-state magnetic structure, with both the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis components of the Mn$^{2+}$ moments long-range ordered. The incommensurate magnetic propagation vector $k$ shows a dramatic change for the intermediate phase between $T\rm_{N1}$ and $T\rm_{N2}$, in which the spin state is speculated to change into a collinear structure with only the $c$-axis moments ordered, as stabilized by thermal fluctuations. The successive magnetic transitions observed in Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ are in line with the expectation for a triangle-lattice antiferromagnet with an easy-axis magnetic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Stability boundaries of the skyrmion phase in non-centrosymmetric ferromagnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability boundaries of the skyrmion lattice in non-centrosymmetric bulk ferromagnets with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in external magnetic field are discussed. We compare the classical energies of the spin configuration of the conical helix and skyrmion lattice within the framework of the stereographic projection approach. It is well known that at low temperatures the skyrmion lattice loses energetically to the conical helix in the entire range of fields, $0 &lt; H &lt; H_{c2}$, where $H_{c2}$ is the transition field to the polarized collinear phase, and $g\mu_B H_{c2} \ll T_c$. We show that taking into account the dipole interaction does not qualitatively change the situation. However, the possibility of fluctuations in the absolute value of the equilibrium local magnetization in the Ginzburg-Landau functional leads, with increasing temperature, $T$, to the skyrmion lattice becoming energetically more favorable than the conical helix in a certain range of fields. We show that it occurs already in the first order of small parameter, $\propto g\mu_B H_{c2}/|T-T_c|$, at the level of mean field theory.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle wavefunction and its equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasiparticle wavefunction of a many-electron system is traditionally defined as the eigenfunction of the quasiparticle eigenvalue equation involving the self-energy. In this article a new concept of a quasiparticle wavefunction is derived from the general definition of the Green function without reference to self-energy. The proposed quasiparticle wavefunction can decay in time, and in contrast to the traditional one it contains not only the main quasiparticle mode but also other modes due to coupling to collective excitations in the system. In the recently developed dynamical exchange-correlation potential formalism, the new definition of a quasiparticle wavefunction leads to an equation of motion with an effective field, which appears to have a simple form expected to be amenable to realistic approximations. A simple model for the effective potential is proposed, which is suitable for electron-gas-like materials such as the alkali.</description>

      <title>Absence of altermagnetic magnon band splitting in MnF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are collinear compensated magnets in which the magnetic sublattices are related by rotation rather than translation or inversion. One of the quintessential properties of altermagnets is the presence of split chiral magnon modes. Recently, such modes have been predicted in MnF$_2$. Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering results on an MnF$_2$ single-crystal along high-symmetry Brillouin zone paths for which the magnon splitting is expected. Within the resolution of our measurement, we do not observe the predicted splitting. The inelastic spectrum is well-modeled using $J_1, ~J_2, ~J_3$ nearest-neighbor exchange interactions with weak uniaxial anisotropy. These interactions have higher symmetry than the crystal lattice, while the interactions predicted to produce the altermagnetic splitting are negligibly small. Therefore, the two magnon modes appear to be degenerate over the entire Brillouin zone and the spin dynamics of MnF$_2$ is indistinguishable from a classical N\'eel antiferromagnet. Application of magnetic field causes a Zeeman splitting of the magnon modes close to the $\mathrm{\Gamma}$ point. Even if chiral magnon modes are allowed by altermagnetic symmetry, the splitting in real materials such as MnF$_2$ can be negligibly small.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall crystals in moir\'e bands with higher Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e materials has sparked the search for further novel phases of matter in this platform. In particular, recent works have demonstrated the possibility of realizing quantum anomalous Hall crystals (QAHCs), which combine the zero-field quantum Hall effect with spontaneously broken translation symmetry. Here, we employ exact diagonalization to demonstrate the existence of stable QAHCs arising from $\frac{2}{3}$-filled moir\'e bands with Chern number $C=2$. Our calculations show that these topological crystals, which are characterized by a quantized Hall conductivity of $1$ and a tripled unit cell, are robust in an ideal model of twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene -- providing a novel explanation for experimental observations in this heterostructure. Furthermore, we predict that the QAHC remains robust in a realistic model of twisted double bilayer graphene and, in addition, we provide a range of optimal tuning parameters, namely twist angle and electric field, for experimentally realizing this phase. Overall, our work demonstrates the stability of QAHCs at odd-denominator filling of $C=2$ bands, provides specific guidelines for future experiments, and establishes chiral multilayer graphene as a theoretical platform for studying topological phases beyond the Landau level paradigm.</description>

      <title>Deteriorated Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Bilayer Cobaltites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wealth of remarkable behaviors is observed at the interfaces between magnetic oxides due to the coexistence of Coulomb repulsion and interatomic exchange interactions. While previous research has focused on bonded oxide heterointerfaces, studies on magnetism in van der Waals interfaces remain rare. In this study, we stacked two freestanding cobaltites with precisely controlled twist angles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed clear and ordered moir\'e patterns, which exhibit an inverse relationship with the twist angle. We found that the Curie temperature in the twisted region is reduced by approximately 13 K compared to the single-layer region using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry. This phenomenon may be related to the weakening of the orbital hybridization between oxygen ions and transition metal ions in the unbonded interfaces. Our findings suggest a potential avenue for modulating magnetic interactions in correlated systems through twist, providing opportunities for the discovery of unknown quantum states.</description>

      <title>Mapping delocalization of impurity bands across archetypal Mott-Anderson transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailoring charge transport in solids on demand is the overarching goal of condensed-matter research as it is crucial for electronic applications. Yet, often the proper tuning knob is missing and extrinsic factors such as impurities and disorder impede coherent conduction. Here we control the very buildup of an electronic band from impurity states within the pseudogap of ternary Fe$_{2-x}$V$_{1+x}$Al Heusler compounds via reducing the Fe content. Our density functional theory calculations combined with specific heat and electrical resistivity experiments reveal that, initially, these states are Andersonlocalized at low V concentrations $0 &lt; x &lt; 0.1$. As x increases, we monitor the formation of mobility edges upon the archetypal Mott-Anderson transition and map the increasing bandwidth of conducting states by thermoelectric measurements. Ultimately, delocalization of charge carriers in fully disordered V$_3$Al results in a resistivity exactly at the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit that is perfectly temperature-independent up to 700 K - more constant than constantan.</description>

      <title>Evidence of spin reorientation transition below 150 K from magnetic force microscopy in a ferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetic transitions in BiFeO$_3$ at low temperature (5-300 K) and observed nearly 90$^o$ rotation of magnetic domains (imaged by vertical magnetic force microscopy) across 150 K in an epitaxial thin film of thickness $\sim$36 nm. It offers a clear evidence of spin reorientation transition. It also corroborates the transition observed below $\sim$150 K in the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization versus temperature data. The field-driven 180$^o$ domain switching at room temperature, on the other hand, signifies presence of ferromagnetism. Since bulk antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ does not exhibit such a transition, this observation in ferromagnetic thin film of BiFeO$_3$ indicates a radical effect because of epitaxial strain. Density functional theory based first-principles calculations too reveal that combined in- and out-of-plane epitaxial strain induces magnetic transition from G- to C-type structure in BiFeO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Persistent Spin Textures in Nonpolar Chiral Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have proposed a novel route for the realisation of persistent spin texture (PST). We have shown from symmetry considerations that in non-polar chiral systems, bands with specific orbital characters around a high symmetry point with $D_{2}$ little group may admit a single spin dependent term in the low energy $\bf{k.p}$ model Hamiltonian that naturally leads to PST. Considering a $2D$ plane in the Brillouin zone (BZ), we have further argued that in such chiral systems the PST is transpired due to the comparable strengths of the Dresselhaus and Weyl (radial) interaction parameters where the presence of these two terms are allowed by the $D{_2}$ symmetry. Finally using first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations we have identified that the non-polar chiral compounds Y$_3$TaO$_7$ and AsBr$_3$ displays PST for the conduction band and valence band respectively around the $\Gamma$ point having $D{_2}$ little group and predominantly Ta-$d_{xz}$ orbital character for Y$_3$TaO$_7$ and Br-$p{_x}$ orbital character for AsBr$_3$ corroborating our general strategy. Our results for the realisation of PST in non-polar chiral systems thereby broaden the class of materials displaying PST that can be employed for application in spin-orbitronics.</description>

      <title>A Lower-Dimensional Remnant of Flux Attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flux attachment is a mechanism allowing electric charges to capture magnetic flux in two spatial dimensions. Fundamentally, this is a consequence of the Aharonov-Bohm effect or, in field-theoretic language, of a Chern-Simons term. This is also intimately related to a transmutation of the exchange statistics of the original charges. We show that a remnant of this mechanism is found after a dimensional reduction of a pure Chern-Simons theory and its subsequent coupling to matter.</description>

      <title>Few-fermion resonant tunneling and underbarrier trapping in asymmetric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tunneling dynamics of few-fermion systems in lattices under asymmetric external potentials - a setup realizable in experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. We first prove that noninteracting fermions exhibit symmetric tunneling probabilities regardless of the barrier's orientation. Then, we demonstrate that inter-particle interactions break this symmetry and lead to pronounced asymmetric tunneling. Remarkably, such a simple system exhibits an unexpectedly diverse range of dynamical behaviors, offering insights into the interplay among fermion-fermion interactions, barrier asymmetry, and spin configurations. We explore the dependence of tunneling behavior on the initial spin configurations: spin-singlet states preserve tunneling symmetry, while spin-triplet states show strong asymmetry. We identify regimes where interactions mediate tunneling through under-barrier resonant trapping and enhance tunneling via many-body resonant tunneling - a phenomenon arising solely from inter-particle interactions and fundamentally different from traditional single-particle resonant tunneling. Our results may be applied to the design of nanoscale devices with tailored transport properties, such as diodes and memristors.</description>

      <title>Gapped commensurate antiferromagnetic response in a strongly underdoped model cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a distinct possibility that spin fluctuations are the pairing interactions in a wide range of unconventional superconductors. In the case of the high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) cuprates, in which superconductivity emerges upon doping an antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating state, spin correlations might furthermore drive unusual pseudogap phenomena. Here we use polarized and unpolarized magnetic neutron scattering to study the simple tetragonal cuprate $\mathrm{HgBa}_{2}\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$ at very low doping ($T_c \approx 55$ K, hole concentration $p \approx 0.064$). In stark contrast to prior results for other underdoped cuprates, we find no evidence of incommensurate spin-density-wave, charge-spin stripe, or $q = 0$ magnetic order. Instead, the antiferromagnetic response in both the superconducting and pseudogap states is gapped below $\Delta_\mathrm{AF} \approx 6$ meV, commensurate over a wide energy range, and disperses above about 55 meV. Given the documented model nature of $\mathrm{HgBa}_{2}\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$, which exhibits high structural symmetry and minimal point disorder effects, we conclude that the observed behavior signifies the unmasked response of the quintessential $\mathrm{CuO}_{2}$ planes near the Mott-insulating state. These results for $\mathrm{HgBa}_{2}\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$ can therefore be expected to serve as a benchmark for a refined theoretical understanding of the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Improving Perturbation Theory with the Sum-of-Squares: Third Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sum-of-squares method can give rigorous lower bounds on the energy of quantum Hamiltonians. Unfortunately, typically using this method requires solving a semidefinite program, which can be computationally expensive. Further, the typically used degree-$4$ sum-of-squares (also known as the 2RDM method) does not correctly reproduce second order perturbation theory. Here, we give a general method, an analogue of Wigner's $2n+1$ rule for perturbation theory, to compute the order of the error in a given sum-of-squares ansatz. We also give a method for finding solutions of the dual semidefinite program, based on a perturbative ansatz combined with a self-consistent method. As an illustration, we show that for a class of model Hamiltonians (with a gap in the quadratic term and quartic terms chosen as i.i.d. Gaussians), this self-consistent sum-of-squares method significantly improves over the 2RDM method in both speed and accuracy, and also improves over low order perturbation theory. We then explain why the particular ansatz we implement is not suitable for use for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians (due to presence of certain large diagonal terms), but we suggest a modified ansatz that may be suitable, which will be the subject of future work.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

      <title>Symmetry protected topological phases under decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16323v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ensembles described by density matrices with potentially nontrivial topological features. In particular, we study a class of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases under various types of decoherence, which can drive a pure SPT state into a mixed state. We demonstrate that the system can still retain the nontrivial topological information from the SPT ground state even under decoherence. In the "doubled Hilbert space", we provide a general definition for symmetry protected topological ensemble (SPT ensemble), and the main quantity that we investigate is various types of (boundary) anomalies in the doubled Hilbert space. We show that the notion of the strange correlator, previously proposed to as a diagnosis for the SPT ground states, can be generalized to capture these anomalies in mixed-state density matrices. Using both exact calculations of the stabilizer Hamiltonians and field theory evaluations, we demonstrate that under decoherence the nontrivial features of the SPT state can persist in the two types of strange correlators: type-I and type-II. We show that the nontrivial type-I strange correlator corresponds to the presence of the SPT information that can be efficiently identified and utilized from experiments, such as for the purpose of preparing for long-range entangled states. The nontrivial type-II strange correlator encodes the full topological response of the decohered mixed state density matrix, i.e., the information about the presence of the SPT state before decoherence. Therefore, our work provides a unified framework to understand decohered SPT phases from the information-theoretic viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in $d$-Electron Kagome Systems: Chern Insulating States from Transverse Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in two-dimensional kagome systems with $d$-orbital electrons is studied within a multi-orbital tight-binding model. We concentrate on the case of isotropic Slater-Koster integrals which is realized in a recently discovered class of metal-organic frameworks TM$_3$C$_6$O$_6$ with transition metals (TM) in the beginning of the 3$d$ series. Furthermore, in the absence of exchange-type spin-orbit coupling, only isotropic Slater-Koster integrals give a perfect flatband in addition to the two dispersive bands hosting relativistic (Dirac) and quadratic band crossing points at high symmetry spots in the Brillouin zone. A quantized topological invariant requires a flux-creating spin-orbit coupling, giving Chern number (per spin sector) $C=1$ not only from the familiar Dirac points at the six corners of the Brillouin zone, but also from the quadratic band crossing point at the center $\Gamma$. In the case of isotropic Slater-Koster integrals the on-site spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is ineffective to create the QAHE and it is only the transfer or exchange-type SOC which can lead to a QAHE. Surprisingly, this QAHE comes from the nontrivial effective flux induced by the \textit{transverse} part of the spin-orbit coupling, exhibited by electrons in the $d$-orbital state with $m_l=0$ ($d_{z^2}$ orbital), in stark contrast to the more familiar form of QAHE due to the $d$-orbitals with $m_l \neq 0$, driven by the Ising part of spin-orbit coupling. The $C=1$ Chern plateau (per spin sector) due to Dirac point extends over a smaller region of Fermi energy than that due to quadratic band crossing. Our result hints at the promising potential of kagome $d$-electron systems as a platform for dissipationless electronics by virtue of its unique QAHE.</description>

      <title>Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first application of quantics tensor trains (QTTs) and tensor cross interpolation (TCI) to the solution of a full set of self-consistent equations for multivariate functions, the so-called parquet equations. We show that the steps needed to evaluate the equations (Bethe--Salpeter equations, parquet equation and Schwinger--Dyson equation) can be decomposed into basic operations on the QTT-TCI (QTCI) compressed objects. The repeated application of these operations does not lead to a loss of accuracy beyond a specified tolerance and the iterative scheme converges even for numerically demanding parameters. As examples we take the Hubbard model in the atomic limit and the single impurity Anderson model, where the basic objects in parquet equations, the two-particle vertices, depend on three frequencies, but not on momenta. The results show that this approach is able to overcome major computational bottlenecks of standard numerical methods. The applied methods allow for an exponential increase of the number of grid points included in the calculations leading to an exponentially improving computational error for a linear increase in computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some intermetallic compounds, the crystallographic structure allows for an unusual latitude of movement of lanthanide ions inside so-called cages. Examples of such magnetic cage systems include the rare-earth hexaborides RB6 and filled skutterudites RPt4Ge12 series. In both instances, the rare-earth site, at the center of the cage, is of high symmetry, which may preserve some degree of orbital degeneracy. A deviation from the cage center lifts this degeneracy, yielding an interplay between the rare-earth movement and the system properties in the paramagnetic range. In particular, the low temperature thermal expansion should reflect this cage-specific crystal field contribution. This study presents an experimental investigation of the thermal expansion in the paramagnetic range of some elements in the aforementioned series. From a simple model for the vibrations in cage systems, a description of the phononic thermal expansion is proposed, within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Accounting for this non-magnetic contributions helps discern the influence of the orbital degeneracy at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Boundary Flat Bands with Topological Spin Textures Protected by Sub-chiral Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry plays an indispensable role in topological classifications as well as in the understanding of the origin of bulk or boundary flat bands. The conventional definition of chiral symmetry refers to the existence of a constant unitary matrix anticommuting with the Hamiltonian. As a constant unitary matrix has constant eigenvectors, boundary flat bands enforced by chiral symmetry, which share the same eigenvectors with the chiral symmetry operator, are dictated to carry fixed (pseudo)spin polarizations and be featureless in quantum geometry. In this work, we generalize the chiral symmetry and introduce a concept termed sub-chiral symmetry. Unlike the conventional chiral symmetry operator defined as constant matrix, the sub-chiral symmetry operator depends on partial components of the momentum vector, so as its eigenvectors. We show that topological gapped or gapless systems without chiral symmetry but with sub-chiral symmetry can support boundary flat bands, which exhibit topological spin textures and quantized Berry phases. We expect that such intriguing boundary flat bands could give rise to a variety of exotic physics in the presence of interactions or disorders.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of neural quantum states in light of the quantum geometric tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum state (NQS) ans\"atze have shown promise in variational Monte Carlo algorithms by their theoretical capability of representing any quantum state. However, the reason behind the practical improvement in their performance with an increase in the number of parameters is not fully understood. In this work, we systematically study the efficiency of a shallow neural network to represent the ground states in different phases of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain, as the number of parameters increases. We train our ansatz by a supervised learning procedure, minimizing the infidelity w.r.t. the exact ground state. We observe that the accuracy of our ansatz improves with the network width in most cases, and eventually saturates. We demonstrate that this can be explained by looking at the spectrum of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), particularly its rank. By introducing an appropriate indicator, we establish that the QGT rank provides a useful diagnostic for the practical representation power of an NQS ansatz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering technique is employed to investigate the paramagnetic spin dynamics in a single crystalline sample of the magnetocaloric compound MnFe$_4$Si$_3$. In the investigated temperature range, 1.033$\times T_{C}$ to 1.5$\times T_{C}$, where $T_C$ is the Curie temperature, the spin fluctuations are well described by the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model predictions. Apart from the Heisenberg exchange, additional pseudo-dipolar interactions manifest through a finite long-wavelength relaxation rate that vanishes at the transition temperature ($T_C = 305$\,K). Based on the characteristic extend of spin fluctuations in wave-vector and energy space we determine that the nature of magnetism in MnFe$_4$Si$_3$ is localized above room temperature. This contrasts with the most celebrated Mn and Fe based magnetocaloric materials that are considered as itinerant magnets.</description>

Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy lose their ability to propagate to long distances in disordered media when undergoing the Anderson localization transition. We use Green functions in an analytically solvable model to describe the vanishing of diffusion at this transition. We find that the low-energy asymptotics of the electron-hole correlation function undergoes a crossover with a disorder-dependent time scale separating the two regimes. This scale determines how long the propagating particle remains captured within a finite volume. It is critical and diverges at the localization transition. According to our analysis, the diffusionless phase consists of quantum bound states that cannot be described in the space of Bloch waves and with the diffusion equation. We identify the necessary amendments to the existing approaches to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the emergence of Anderson localization.</description>
