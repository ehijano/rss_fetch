      <title>WeatherEdit: Controllable Weather Editing with 4D Gaussian Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

      <title>Techniques for Quantum-Computing-Aided Algorithmic Composition: Experiments in Rhythm, Timbre, Harmony, and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing can be employed in computer-aided music composition to control various attributes of the music at different structural levels. This article describes the application of quantum simulation to model compositional decision making, the simulation of quantum particle tracking to produce noise-based timbres, the use of basis state vector rotation to cause changing probabilistic behaviors in granular harmonic textures, and the exploitation of quantum measurement error to cause noisy perturbations of spatial soundpaths. We describe the concepts fundamental to these techniques, we provide algorithms and software enacting them, and we provide examples demonstrating their implementation in computer-generated music.</description>

      <title>Multi-VQC: A Novel QML Approach for Enhancing Healthcare Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable diagnosis of diseases is crucial in enabling timely medical treatment and enhancing patient survival rates. In recent years, Machine Learning has revolutionized diagnostic practices by creating classification models capable of identifying diseases. However, these classification problems often suffer from significant class imbalances, which can inhibit the effectiveness of traditional models. Therefore, the interest in Quantum models has arisen, driven by the captivating promise of overcoming the limitations of the classical counterpart thanks to their ability to express complex patterns by mapping data in a higher-dimensional computational space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in Healthcare: Evaluating QNN and QSVM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective and accurate diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart failure is crucial for timely medical intervention and improving patient survival rates. Machine learning has revolutionized diagnostic methods in recent years by developing classification models that detect diseases based on selected features. However, these classification tasks are often highly imbalanced, limiting the performance of classical models. Quantum models offer a promising alternative, exploiting their ability to express complex patterns by operating in a higher-dimensional computational space through superposition and entanglement. These unique properties make quantum models potentially more effective in addressing the challenges of imbalanced datasets. This work evaluates the potential of quantum classifiers in healthcare, focusing on Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), comparing them with popular classical models. The study is based on three well-known healthcare datasets -- Prostate Cancer, Heart Failure, and Diabetes. The results indicate that QSVMs outperform QNNs across all datasets due to their susceptibility to overfitting. Furthermore, quantum models prove the ability to overcome classical models in scenarios with high dataset imbalance. Although preliminary, these findings highlight the potential of quantum models in healthcare classification tasks and lead the way for further research in this domain.</description>

      <title>A Structured Unplugged Approach for Foundational AI Literacy in Primary Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Younger generations are growing up in a world increasingly shaped by intelligent technologies, making early AI literacy crucial for developing the skills to critically understand and navigate them. However, education in this field often emphasizes tool-based learning, prioritizing usage over understanding the underlying concepts. This lack of knowledge leaves non-experts, especially children, prone to misconceptions, unrealistic expectations, and difficulties in recognizing biases and stereotypes. In this paper, we propose a structured and replicable teaching approach that fosters foundational AI literacy in primary students, by building upon core mathematical elements closely connected to and of interest in primary curricula, to strengthen conceptualization, data representation, classification reasoning, and evaluation of AI. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an empirical study with thirty-one fifth-grade students across two classes, evaluating their progress through a post-test and a satisfaction survey. Our results indicate improvements in terminology understanding and usage, features description, logical reasoning, and evaluative skills, with students showing a deeper comprehension of decision-making processes and their limitations. Moreover, the approach proved engaging, with students particularly enjoying activities that linked AI concepts to real-world reasoning.

      <title>Democratizing Differential Privacy: A Participatory AI Framework for Public Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a conversational interface system that enables participatory design of differentially private AI systems in public sector applications. Addressing the challenge of balancing mathematical privacy guarantees with democratic accountability, we propose three key contributions: (1) an adaptive $\epsilon$-selection protocol leveraging TOPSIS multi-criteria decision analysis to align citizen preferences with differential privacy (DP) parameters, (2) an explainable noise-injection framework featuring real-time Mean Absolute Error (MAE) visualizations and GPT-4-powered impact analysis, and (3) an integrated legal-compliance mechanism that dynamically modulates privacy budgets based on evolving regulatory constraints. Our results advance participatory AI practices by demonstrating how conversational interfaces can enhance public engagement in algorithmic privacy mechanisms, ensuring that privacy-preserving AI in public sector governance remains both mathematically robust and democratically accountable.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Can Require Exponential Time to Optimize Linear Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QAOA is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve optimization problems in gate-based quantum computers. It is based on a variational quantum circuit that can be interpreted as a discretization of the annealing process that quantum annealers follow to find a minimum energy state of a given Hamiltonian. This ensures that QAOA must find an optimal solution for any given optimization problem when the number of layers, $p$, used in the variational quantum circuit tends to infinity. In practice, the number of layers is usually bounded by a small number. This is a must in current quantum computers of the NISQ era, due to the depth limit of the circuits they can run to avoid problems with decoherence and noise. In this paper, we show mathematical evidence that QAOA requires exponential time to solve linear functions when the number of layers is less than the number of different coefficients of the linear function $n$. We conjecture that QAOA needs exponential time to find the global optimum of linear functions for any constant value of $p$, and that the runtime is linear only if $p \geq n$. We conclude that we need new quantum algorithms to reach quantum supremacy in quantum optimization.</description>
