      <title>Convergence Analysis of the Stochastic Resolution of Identity: Comparing Hutchinson to Hutch++ for the Second-Order Green's Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic orbital techniques offer reduced computational scaling and memory requirements to describe ground and excited states at the cost of introducing controlled statistical errors. Such techniques often rely on two basic operations, stochastic trace estimation and stochastic resolution of identity, both of which lead to statistical errors that scale with the number of stochastic realizations ($N_{\xi}$) as $\sqrt{N_{\xi}^{-1}}$. Reducing the statistical errors without significantly increasing $N_{\xi}$ has been challenging and is central to the development of efficient and accurate stochastic algorithms. In this work, we build upon recent progress made to improve stochastic trace estimation based on the ubiquitous Hutchinson's algorithm and propose a two-step approach for the stochastic resolution of identity, in the spirit of the Hutch++ method. Our approach is based on employing a randomized low-rank approximation followed by a residual calculation, resulting in statistical errors that scale much better than $\sqrt{N_{\xi}^{-1}}$. We implement the approach within the second-order Born approximation for the self-energy in the computation of neutral excitations and discuss three different low-rank approximations for the two-body Coulomb integrals. Tests on a series of hydrogen dimer chains with varying lengths demonstrate that the Hutch++-like approximations are computationally more efficient than both deterministic and purely stochastic (Hutchinson) approaches for low error thresholds and intermediate system sizes. Notably, for arbitrarily large systems, the Hutchinson-like approximation outperforms both deterministic and Hutch++-like methods.</description>

      <title>Stationary conditions for excited states: the surprising impact of density-driven correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical density functional theory (DFT) and approximations thereto solve the many-electron ground state problem by working from a non-interacting Kohn-Sham reference system. In practice, DFT benefits from useful minimization conditions that let approximate solutions iteratively approach the optimal energy and density. The present work reveals that stationary conditions also apply to all excited states of general electronic systems; and may be defined straightforwardly from ensemble extensions of DFT. However, it also reveals that the stationary condition for the non-interacting Kohn-Sham reference systems that make density functional theory numerically efficient is more complex than the ground state problem. The extra complexity reflects a contribution from density-driven correlations. Some implications for approximations and self-consistency are discussed.</description>

      <title>Mixed Polyanionic NaFe$_{1.6}$V$_{0.4}$(PO$_{4}$)(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$@CNT Cathode for Sodium-ion Batteries: Electrochemical Diffusion Kinetics and Distribution of Relaxation Time Analysis at Different Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the electrochemical sodium-ion kiinetics and distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis of a newly designed mixed polyanionic NaFe$_{1.6}$V$_{0.4}$(PO$_{4}$)(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$@CNT composite as a cathode. The specific capacity of 104 mAhg$^{-1}$ is observed at 0.1~C with the average working voltage of $\sim$3~V. Intriguingly, a remarkable rate capability and reversibility are demonstrated up to very high current rate of 25~C. The long cycling test up to 10~C shows high capacity retention even after 2000 cycles. The detailed analysis of galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) data reveal the diffusion coefficient of 10$^{-8}$--10$^{-11}$ cm$^{2}$s$^{-1}$. We find excellent stability in the thermal testing between 25--55$^\circ$C temperatures and 80\% capacity retention up to 100 cycles at 5~C. Further, we analyse the individual electrochemical processes in the time domain using the novel DRT technique at different temperatures. The {\it ex-situ} investigation shows the stable and reversible structure, morphology and electronic states of the long cycled cathode material. More importantly, we demonstrate relatively high specific energy of $\approx$155 Wh kg$^{-1}$ (considering the total active material loading of both the electrodes) at 0.2~C for full cell battery having excellent rate capability up to 10~C and long cyclic stability at 1~C.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Fast Geometry Optimization with Time Estimation and Method Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry optimization is an important task in quantum chemical calculations to analyze the characteristics of molecules. A top concern on it is a long execution time because time-consuming energy and gradient calculations are repeated across several to tens of steps. In this work, we present a scheme to estimate the execution times of geometry optimization of a target molecule at different accuracy levels (i.e., the combinations of ab initio methods and basis sets). It enables to identify the accuracy levels where geometry optimization will finish in an acceptable time. In addition, we propose a gradient-based method switching (GMS) technique that reduces the execution time by dynamically switching multiple methods during geometry optimization. Our evaluation using 46 molecules in total shows that the geometry optimization times at 20 accuracy levels are estimated with a mean error of 29.5%, and GMS reduces the execution time by up to 42.7% without affecting the accuracy of geometry optimization.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Catalyst Discovery Using Multicriteria Bayesian Optimization with Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance catalysts are crucial for sustainable energy conversion and human health. However, the discovery of catalysts faces challenges due to the absence of efficient approaches to navigating vast and high-dimensional structure and composition spaces. In this study, we propose a high-throughput computational catalyst screening approach integrating density functional theory (DFT) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). Within the BO framework, we propose an uncertainty-aware atomistic machine learning model, UPNet, which enables automated representation learning directly from high-dimensional catalyst structures and achieves principled uncertainty quantification. Utilizing a constrained expected improvement acquisition function, our BO framework simultaneously considers multiple evaluation criteria. Using the proposed methods, we explore catalyst discovery for the CO2 reduction reaction. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves high prediction accuracy, facilitates interpretable feature extraction, and enables multicriteria design optimization, leading to significant reduction of computing power and time (10x reduction of required DFT calculations) in high-performance catalyst discovery.</description>

      <title>A multigrain-multilayer astrochemical model with variable desorption energy for surface species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Interstellar surface chemistry is a complex process that occurs in icy layers accumulated onto grains of different sizes. Efficiency of surface processes often depends on the immediate environment of adsorbed molecules. Aims. We investigate how gas-grain chemistry changes when surface molecule desorption is made explicitly dependent to the molecular binding energy, which is modified, depending on the properties of the surface. Methods. Molecular binding energy changes gradually for three different environments - bare grain, where polar, water-dominated ices and non-polar, carbon monoxide-dominated ices. In addition to diffusion, evaporation and chemical desorption, photodesorption was also made binding energy-dependent, in line with experimental results. These phenomena occur in a collapsing prestellar core model that considers five grain sizes with ices arranged into four layers. Results. Efficient chemical desorption from bare grains significantly delays ice accumulation. Easier surface diffusion of molecules on non-polar ices promotes the production of carbon dioxide and other species. Conclusions. The composition of interstellar ices is regulated by several binding-energy dependent desorption mechanisms. Their actions overlap in time and space, which explains the ubiquitous proportions of major ice components (water and carbon oxides), observed to be similar in all directions.</description>

      <title>Floquet Nonadiabatic Mixed Quantum-Classical Dynamics in Laser-Dressed Solid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Floquet Ehrenfest and Floquet surface hopping approaches to study the nonadiabatic dynamics in the laser-dressed solid systems. We demonstrate that these two approaches can be formulated in both real and reciprocal spaces. Using these approaches, we are able to simulate the interaction between electronic carriers and phonons under periodic drivings, such as strong light-matter interactions. Employing the Holstein and Peierls models, we show that the strong light-matter interactions can effectively modulate the dynamics of electronic population and mobility. Notably, our study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of modeling low-momentum carriers' interactions with phonons using a truncated reciprocal-space basis, an approach impractical in real-space frameworks. Moreover, we reveal that even with significant truncation, carrier populations derived from surface hopping maintain greater accuracy compared to those obtained via meanfield dynamics. These results underscore the potential of our proposed methods in advancing the understanding of carrier-phonon interactions in various laser-dressed materials.</description>

      <title>UAlign: Pushing the Limit of Template-free Retrosynthesis Prediction with Unsupervised SMILES Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Retrosynthesis planning poses a formidable challenge in the organic chemical industry. Single-step retrosynthesis prediction, a crucial step in the planning process, has witnessed a surge in interest in recent years due to advancements in AI for science. Various deep learning-based methods have been proposed for this task in recent years, incorporating diverse levels of additional chemical knowledge dependency.
  Results: This paper introduces UAlign, a template-free graph-to-sequence pipeline for retrosynthesis prediction. By combining graph neural networks and Transformers, our method can more effectively leverage the inherent graph structure of molecules. Based on the fact that the majority of molecule structures remain unchanged during a chemical reaction, we propose a simple yet effective SMILES alignment technique to facilitate the reuse of unchanged structures for reactant generation. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art template-free and semi-template-based approaches. Importantly, our template-free method achieves effectiveness comparable to, or even surpasses, established powerful template-based methods.
  Scientific contribution: We present a novel graph-to-sequence template-free retrosynthesis prediction pipeline that overcomes the limitations of Transformer-based methods in molecular representation learning and insufficient utilization of chemical information. We propose an unsupervised learning mechanism for establishing product-atom correspondence with reactant SMILES tokens, achieving even better results than supervised SMILES alignment methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art template-free methods and rivals or surpasses template-based approaches, with up to 5\% (top-5) and 5.4\% (top-10) increased accuracy over the strongest baseline.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Normalizing Flows for Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) for real-space systems has historically depended on Lagrange optimization techniques, primarily due to the inability of previously proposed electron density ansatze to ensure the normalization constraint. This study illustrates how leveraging contemporary generative models, notably normalizing flows (NFs), can surmount this challenge. We pioneer a Lagrangian-free optimization framework by employing these machine learning models as ansatze for the electron density. This novel approach also integrates cutting-edge variational inference techniques and equivariant deep learning models, offering an innovative alternative to the OF-DFT problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework by simulating a one-dimensional diatomic system, LiH, and comprehensive simulations of H$_2$, LiH, and H$_2$O molecules. The inherent flexibility of NFs facilitates initialization with promolecular densities, markedly enhancing the efficiency of the optimization process.</description>

      <title>Exact first-order effect of interactions on the ground-state energy of harmonically-confined fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ spinless fermions, interacting with each other via a power-law interaction $\epsilon/r^n$, and trapped in an external harmonic potential $V(r) = r^2/2$, in $d=1,2,3$ dimensions. For any $0 &lt; n &lt; d+2$, we obtain the ground-state energy $E_N$ of the system perturbatively in $\epsilon$, $E_{N}=E_{N}^{\left(0\right)}+\epsilon E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}+O\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)$. We calculate $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$ exactly, assuming that $N$ is such that the "outer shell" is filled. For the case of $n=1$ (corresponding to a Coulomb interaction for $d=3$), we extract the $N \gg 1$ behavior of $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$, focusing on the corrections to the exchange term with respect to the leading-order term that is predicted from the local density approximation applied to the Thomas-Fermi approximate density distribution. The leading correction contains a logarithmic divergence, and is of particular importance in the context of density functional theory. We also study the effect of the interactions on the fermions' spatial density. Finally, we find that our result for $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$ significantly simplifies in the case where $n$ is even.</description>

      <title>MultiModal-Learning for Predicting Molecular Properties: A Framework Based on Image and Graph Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for accurate prediction of drug molecule properties poses a fundamental challenge in the realm of Artificial Intelligence Drug Discovery (AIDD). An effective representation of drug molecules emerges as a pivotal component in this pursuit. Contemporary leading-edge research predominantly resorts to self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to extract meaningful structural representations from large-scale, unlabeled molecular data, subsequently fine-tuning these representations for an array of downstream tasks. However, an inherent shortcoming of these studies lies in their singular reliance on one modality of molecular information, such as molecule image or SMILES representations, thus neglecting the potential complementarity of various molecular modalities. In response to this limitation, we propose MolIG, a novel MultiModaL molecular pre-training framework for predicting molecular properties based on Image and Graph structures. MolIG model innovatively leverages the coherence and correlation between molecule graph and molecule image to execute self-supervised tasks, effectively amalgamating the strengths of both molecular representation forms. This holistic approach allows for the capture of pivotal molecular structural characteristics and high-level semantic information. Upon completion of pre-training, Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder is used for the prediction of downstream tasks. In comparison to advanced baseline models, MolIG exhibits enhanced performance in downstream tasks pertaining to molecular property prediction within benchmark groups such as MoleculeNet Benchmark Group and ADMET Benchmark Group.</description>

      <title>Ionic conductivity of a lithium-doped deep eutectic solvent: Glass formation and rotation-translation coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep eutectic solvents with admixed lithium salts are considered as electrolytes in electrochemical devices like batteries or supercapacitors. Compared to eutectic mixtures of hydrogen-bond donors and lithium salts, their raw-material costs are significantly lower. Not much is known about the glassy freezing and rotation-translation coupling of such systems. Here we investigate these phenomena by applying dielectric spectroscopy to the widely studied deep eutectic solvent glyceline, to which 1 and 5 mol% LiCl were added. Our studies cover a wide temperature range, including the deeply supercooled state. The temperature dependences of the detected dipolar reorientation dynamics and of the ionic dc conductivity reveal the signatures of glassy freezing. In comparison to pure glyceline, lithium admixture leads to a reduction of ionic conductivity, which is accompanied by a slowing down of the rotational dipolar motions. However, this reduction is much smaller than for DESs, where one main component is a lithium salt, which we trace back to the smaller glass-transition temperatures of the lithium-doped DESs. In contrast to pure glyceline, the ionic and dipolar dynamics become increasingly decoupled at low temperatures and obey a fractional Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation as previously found in other glass-forming liquids. The obtained results demonstrate the relevance of decoupling effects and of the glass transition for the enhancement of the technically relevant ionic conductivity in such lithium-doped DESs.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation Induced Non-monotonic Height Change and Microphase Separation of Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>
