      <title>A Multi Affine Geometric Framework for Quantum Nonlocality. Unifying Berry Phases, Entanglement, and Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a multi affine geometric framework to unify classical and quantum mechanical laws through the lens of information geometry. By combining the principle of stationary action with maximum entropy production, we show that divergences in dual affine connections naturally give rise to quantum interference and nonlocal correlations. These ideas of maximum entropy and stationary align with the framework of entropic dynamics, wherein time evolution emerges from information-theoretic principles. A key insight comes from Berry phases. the mismatch of multiple affine connections leads to a nontrivial holonomy or "area", explaining how Bell type inequalities can be violated up to the Tsirelson bound. Additionally, we interpret sharply peaked distributions as "pinning" or "sourcing" curvature in the information manifold, drawing an analogy to a membrane under uniform stress. In this view, entanglement and coherence emerge as geometric features, phases and rotations within an overarching multi affine structure. We conclude that phenomena such as wavefunction collapse and quantum steering can be viewed as constraints on the manifold's "laxity" or curvature, with far-reaching implications for understanding quantum behavior in a geometric-information setting.</description>

      <title>Antimatter Gravity Experiments, the Astronomical Challenges to Lambda-CDM Cosmology and the Quantum Vacuum as a Possible Source of Gravity in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review is motivated by the first result of the ALPHA-g experiment at CERN, which indicates that atoms and anti-atoms have different gravitational charges; according to measurements, the gravitational acceleration of anti-atoms is only 0.75 of that of ordinary matter. If confirmed by more precise measurements, this will greatly increase the plausibility of the emerging cosmological model, which is based on the working hypothesis that quantum vacuum fluctuations are virtual gravitational dipoles; a hypothesis that opens up the possibility that the quantum vacuum is a major source of gravity in the universe (which could eventually eliminate the need for the hypothetical dark matter and dark energy). This laboratory challenge to general relativity and Lambda-CDM cosmology is complemented by astronomical challenges (the Hubble tension, very fast initial growth of structures in the Universe, dark energy deviating from the cosmological constant...). The intriguing question is: do the antimatter gravity experiments at CERN and the recent astronomical observations point to the same (highly unexpected) new physics? With this question in mind, we briefly review the antimatter gravity experiments at CERN and elsewhere, together with the major astronomical challenges and the emerging Quantum Vacuum cosmology, which seems to be compatible with the ALPHA-g result and with the preliminary astronomical challenges. The laboratory and astronomical challenges have suddenly taken us into terra incognita, where we need absolutely unprecedented imagination and open-minded thinking.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetism from relativistic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a matter-space framework characterizing particles and establish its compatibility with electromagnetism. In this approach, matter, such as photons, is considered to reside in a three-dimensional matter space, with the electromagnetic fields observed in four-dimensional spacetime interpreted as projections from this space. By imposing gauge symmetry through constraint equations, we derive the relationship between the vector field $A_a$ and the antisymmetric tensor $F_{ab}$, forming part of Maxwell's equations. The remaining Maxwell equation is obtained through the action principle in relativistic fluid dynamics. Notably, we demonstrate that this imposition of the gauge symmetry and constraints develop the dynamics. This framework offers a fresh perspective on particle-field interactions and deepens the theoretical foundation of relativistic fluid dynamics.</description>
