      <title>Extended branching Rauzy induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22588v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branching Rauzy induction is a two-sided form of Rauzy induction that acts on regular interval exchange transformations (IETs). We introduce an extended form of branching Rauzy induction that applies to arbitrary standard IETs, including non-minimal ones. The procedure generalizes the branching Rauzy method with two induction steps, merging and splitting, to handle equal-length cuts and invariant components respectively. As an application, we show, via a stepwise morphic argument, that all return words in the language of an arbitrary IET cluster in the Burrows-Wheeler sense.</description>

      <title>The Target Discounted-Sum Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The target discounted-sum problem is the following: Given a rational discount factor $0&lt;\lambda&lt;1$ and three rational values $a,b$, and $t$, does there exist a finite or an infinite sequence $w \in \{a,b\}^*$ or $w \in \{a,b\}^\omega$, such that $\sum_{i=0}^{|w|} w(i) \lambda^i$ equals $t$?
  The problem turns out to relate to many fields of mathematics and computer science, and its decidability question is surprisingly hard to solve.
  We solve the finite version of the problem, and show the hardness of the infinite version, linking it to various areas and open problems in mathematics and computer science: $\beta$-expansions, discounted-sum automata, piecewise affine maps, and generalizations of the Cantor set. We provide some partial results to the infinite version, among which are solutions to its restriction to eventually-periodic sequences and to the cases that $\lambda \geq \frac{1}{2}$ or $\lambda=\frac{1}{n}$, for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$.
  We use our results for solving some open problems on discounted-sum automata, among which are the exact-value, universality and inclusion problems for functional automata.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: A Formal Investigation of the Relationship Between Log and Model Complexity -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simple process models are key for effectively communicating the outcomes of process mining. An important question in this context is whether the complexity of event logs used as inputs to process discovery algorithms can serve as a reliable indicator of the complexity of the resulting process models. Although various complexity measures for both event logs and process models have been proposed in the literature, the relationship between input and output complexity remains largely unexplored. In particular, there are no established guidelines or theoretical foundations that explain how the complexity of an event log influences the complexity of the discovered model. This paper examines whether formal guarantees exist such that increasing the complexity of event logs leads to increased complexity in the discovered models. We study 18 log complexity measures and 17 process model complexity measures across five process discovery algorithms. Our findings reveal that only the complexity of the flower model can be established by an event log complexity measure. For all other algorithms, we investigate which log complexity measures influence the complexity of the discovered models. The results show that current log complexity measures are insufficient to decide which discovery algorithms to choose to construct simple models. We propose that authors of process discovery algorithms provide insights into which log complexity measures predict the complexity of their results.</description>

      <title>On the order of lazy cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the most elementary family of cellular automata defined over an arbitrary group universe $G$ and an alphabet $A$: the lazy cellular automata, which act as the identity on configurations in $A^G$, except when they read a unique active transition $p \in A^S$, in which case they write a fixed symbol $a \in A$. As expected, the dynamical behavior of lazy cellular automata is relatively simple, yet subtle questions arise since they completely depend on the choice of $p$ and $a$. In this paper, we investigate the order of a lazy cellular automaton $\tau : A^G \to A^G$, defined as the cardinality of the set $\{ \tau^k : k \in \mathbb{N} \}$. In particular, we establish a general upper bound for the order of $\tau$ in terms of $p$ and $a$, and we prove that this bound is attained when $p$ is a quasi-constant pattern.</description>

      <title>Normal forms in Virus Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we further study the computational power of virus machines (VMs in short).VMs provide a computing paradigm inspired by the transmission and replication networks of viruses.VMs consist of process units (called hosts) structured by a directed graph whose arcs are called channels and an instruction graph that controls the transmissions of virus objects among hosts. The present work complements our understanding of the computing power of VMs by introducing normal forms; these expressions restrict the features in a given computing model.Some of the features that we restrict in our normal forms include (a) the number of hosts, (b) the number of instructions, and (c) the number of virus objects in each host. After we recall some known results on the computing power of VMs we give our series of normal forms, such as the size of the loops in the network, proving new characterisations of family of sets, such as finite sets, semilinear sets, or recursively enumerable sets (NRE).</description>
