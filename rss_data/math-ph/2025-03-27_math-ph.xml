      <title>Hilbert Grassmannians as classifying spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short work we prove that the Hilbert Grassmannians endowed with the weak topology are models for the classifying spaces of the unitary groups. As application of this result one can use Hilbert Grassmannians for the presentation of the $K$-theory of topological spaces by computing equivalences classes of homotopy equivalent maps.</description>

      <title>The Many-Body Ground State Manifold of Flat Band Interacting Hamiltonian for Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At a magic relative twist angle, magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has an octet of flat bands that can host strong correlation physics when partially filled. A key theoretical discovery in MATBG is the existence of ferromagnetic Slater determinants as exact ground states of the corresponding flat band interacting (FBI) Hamiltonian. The FBI Hamiltonian describes the behavior of electrons that interact with each other in a high-dimensional space, and is constructed from the band structure of the non-interacting Bistritzer--MacDonald model at the chiral limit. A key property of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG is that it is frustration free and can be written as a sum of non-commuting terms. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the ground state manifold of the FBI Hamiltonian, proving that it is precisely the linear span of such ferromagnetic Slater determinants.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical physics, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism (also called Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism) is used to derive a linear integro-differential equation for observables in Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. We prove that the GLE together with the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT) uniquely define the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. The GLE and 2FDT are an immediate consequence of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of linear Volterra equations. They neither rely on the Dyson identity nor on the concept of orthogonal dynamics. This holds true for autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. Further results are obtained for the Mori projection for autonomous systems, for which the fluctuating forces are orthogonal to the observable of interest. In particular, we prove that the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}Q$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. As a consequence, the corresponding orbit maps (e.g.~the fluctuating forces) are the unique mild solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonal dynamics is a unitary group, if $\mathcal{L}$ is skew-adjoint. In this case, the fluctuating forces are stationary. In addition, we present a proof of the GLE by means of semigroup theory, and we retrieve the commonly used definitions for the fluctuating forces, memory kernel, and orthogonal dynamics. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems, whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup. This includes large classes of systems in classical statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Contact Lie systems on Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces: from scaling symmetries to curvature-dependent reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adaptation of the notion of scaling symmetries for the case of Lie-Hamilton systems, allowing their subsequent reduction to contact Lie systems. As an illustration of the procedure, time-dependent frequency oscillators and time-dependent thermodynamic systems are analyzed from this point of view. The formalism provides a novel method for constructing contact Lie systems on the three-dimensional sphere, derived from recently established Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental four-dimensional representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$. It is shown that these systems are a particular case of a larger hierarchy of contact Lie systems on a special class of three-dimensional homogeneous spaces, namely the Cayley-Klein spaces. These include Riemannian spaces (sphere, hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes. Under certain topological conditions, some of these systems retrieve well-known two-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems through a curvature-dependent reduction.</description>

      <title>On light cone bounds in quantum open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study propagation of quantum information in few-body Markov quantum open systems (MQOS). For a large class of such systems, we prove the existence of an effective light cone with an exponentially small spill-over. We also prove a Lieb-Robinson-type bound and a lower bound on the delivery time of quantum messages. \par
  Mathematically, we describe space-time behavior of solutions of the von Neumann-Lindblad equation underlying the dynamics of MQOS, which is a natural extension of the Schr\"odinger equation and is a key example of a non-Abelian PDE of quantum physics.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic perturbation theory for Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge covariant magnetic perturbation theory is tailored for one-body Schr\"odinger operators perturbed by long-range magnetic fields. In this work we present a self-contained exposition of the method, by outlining its technical foundations and discussing the physical heuristics behind the proofs. We apply it in order to prove the stability of spectral gaps and to study the location of the discrete spectrum. We also analyze the (lack of) continuity with respect to the magnetic field of spectral projections corresponding to finite spectral islands, which is a particularly important situation for systems modelling Chern insulators. Finally, we show how to construct approximate projections that have an explicit dependence with respect to the magnetic field parameter.</description>

      <title>Vacua and infrared radiation in de Sitter quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic behavior of quantum fields and perturbative quantum gravity in de Sitter space. We show that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a de Sitter invariant vacuum state in the free theory is if the local field observables commute with the ``memory observable'' on any cosmological horizon. This criterion yields simple, gauge-invariant proofs of the existence of a de Sitter invariant vacuum for the (source-free) massive scalar field, electromagnetic field and linearized gravitational field. However, the massless, minimally coupled scalar does not satisfy this criterion and, consequently, there is no de Sitter invariant vacuum state. In this case, we construct the Hilbert space of normalizable states that have ``square integrable'' distributions in the memory and the conjugate constant mode. This Hilbert space has a unitary representation of the de Sitter symmetry group but no de Sitter invariant normalizable state. However even for free theories with a normalizable de Sitter invariant vacuum we show, by a simple example, that in the presence of a source a large number of infrared particles can be produced if the source interacts with the field for timescales much longer than the Hubble time. In the limit as the source persists forever it emits an infinite number of infrared particles.</description>

      <title>A Supertwistor Formalism for $\mathcal{N}=1,2,3,4\;\text{SCFT}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a manifest supertwistor space formalism for three dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1, 2,3,4$ superconformal field theories. This formalism simultaneously makes manifest the supersymmetry, conformal invariance and conservation. We solve two and three point correlators of (half) integer spin conserved supercurrents using the graded supergroup generators. Apart from the superconformal generators, we find that the superhelicity operators are necessary to fix their functional form in this setup. The superhelicity operators can be recast into first order Euler equations which besides the standard polynomial solutions, also admit weak solutions that are distributional in nature. They play an important role in the case of three point functions, where the super-correlator takes the form of a product of delta functions. Interestingly, we find that these super-correlators are extremely simple, elegant and uniform for all spins and for all $\mathcal{N}\leq4$, which resemble the non supersymmetric correlators where the twistors are replaced with appropriately defined supertwistors.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic evaluation of three-dimensional integrals with singularities in application to wave phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional Fourier integral in which the exponent in the exponential factor is the product of some phase function and a large parameter. The asymptotics of this integral is sought when the large parameter tends to infinity. In the one-dimensional case, the asymptotics of such an integral is constructed by the points of stationary phase and singularities of the integrand. The three-dimensional case is more complicated: special points such as points of stationary phase in the domain, on singularity, on the crossing of singularities, points of triple crossing of singularities, and also conical points of the singularities, can contribute to the asymptotics. For all these types of singularities, topological conditions for the existence of nonzero asymptotics are constructed, and the asymptotics themselves are derived. The proposed technique is tested on the example of the classical problem of Kelvin waves on the surface of a deep fluid behind a towed body.</description>

      <title>The Geometric Refinement Transform: A Novel Uncountably Infinite Transform Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel and general class of continuous transforms based on hierarchical Voronoi based refinement schemes. The resulting transform space generalizes classical approaches such as wavelets and Radon transforms by incorporating parameters of refinement multiplicity, dispersion, and rotation. We rigorously establish key properties of the transform including completeness, uniqueness, invertibility, closure, and stability using frame bounds over functions of bounded variation and define a natural inner product structure emerging in L2. We identify regions of parameter space that recover known transforms, including multiscale wavelet decompositions and the generalized Radon transform. Applications are discussed across a range of disciplines, with particular emphasis on entropy formulations. Notably, the transform remains well behaved on geometrically complex and even non convex domains, where traditional methods may struggle. Despite the complexity of the underlying geometry, the coefficient spectrum reveals structure, offering insight even in highly irregular settings.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States and Symmetry: A Group-Theoretic Framework for Gauge-Invariant Packaged Entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a group-theoretic framework showing that any nontrivial representation of a finite or compact group inherently induces packaged entanglement (in which every internal quantum numbers are inseparably entangled) in multiparticle quantum systems. 
In this framework, each single-particle excitation carries an inseparable block of internal quantum numbers dictated by its irreducible representation. 
The local gauge constraints or superselection rules forbid any partial fractionation of charges or quantum labels. 
We illustrate this principle through gauge symmetries ($U(1)$, $SU(2)$, and $SU(3)$), discrete symmetries (charge conjugation $C$, parity $P$, time reversal $T$, and their combinations), and $p$-form symmetries. 
In each case, physical requirements (e.g., gauge invariance or superselection) ensure that the resulting states cannot be factorized. These naturally explain phenomena like Bell-type structures, color confinement, and hybrid gauge-invariant configurations. 
The packaging principle bridges concepts in gauge theory, quantum information, and topological classifications. Our results may be useful for applications in exotic hadron spectroscopy, the exploration of extended symmetries in field theory, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the sticky disk energy where distances between particles are evaluated through the sup norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ in the plane. We first prove crystallization of minimizers in the square lattice, for any fixed number $N$ of particles. Then we consider the limit as $N\to\infty$: in contrast to the standard sticky disk, there is only one orientation in the limit, and we are able to compute explicitly the $\Gamma$-limit to be an anisotropic perimeter with octagonal Wulff shape. The results are based on an energy decomposition for graphs that generalizes the one proved by De Luca-Friesecke [J. Nonlinear Sci. 28 (2018), 69-90] in the triangular case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is the second chapter of a two-part series dedicated to the mathematical study of the higher-spin symmetry enjoyed by the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ boundary Toda Conformal Field Theory. Namely, based on a probabilistic definition of this model and building on the framework introduced in the first article of this series, we compute some singular vectors of the theory which at the level of correlation functions give rise to higher equations of motion. Under additional assumptions these become BPZ-type differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions, a key feature in the perspective of a rigorous derivation of the structure constants of the theory. Such equations of motion and differential equations were previously unknown in the physics literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) is known to have an underlying quantum group theoretical description. We precisely pinpoint the quantum group structure, improving upon earlier work in the literature. This allows us to utilize this framework for bulk gravitational applications. We explain bulk discretization in DSSYK from the underlying irreducibility of the representations. We derive trumpet and brane amplitudes using character insertions of the quantum group, simplifying earlier calculations. Most importantly, we factorize the bulk Hilbert space dual to DSSYK in the quantum group description using a complete set of edge degrees of freedom living at a bulk entangling surface. An analogous treatment for $\mathcal{N}=1$ DSSYK is provided in the same quantum group theoretical framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the trigonometric quantum spin-Calogero-Sutherland model, and the Haldane-Shastry spin chain as a special case, using a Bethe-ansatz analysis. We harness the model's Yangian symmetry to import the standard tools of integrability for Heisenberg spin chains into the world of integrable long-range models with spins. From the transfer matrix with a diagonal twist we construct Heisenberg-style symmetries (Bethe algebra) that refine the usual hierarchy of commuting Hamiltonians (quantum determinant) of the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model. We compute the first few of these new conserved charges explicitly, and diagonalise them by Bethe ansatz inside each irreducible Yangian representation. This yields a new eigenbasis for the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model that generalises the Yangian Gelfand-Tsetlin basis of Takemura-Uglov. The Bethe-ansatz analysis involves non-generic values of the inhomogeneities. Our review of the inhomogeneous Heisenberg XXX chain, with special attention to how the Bethe ansatz works in the presence of fusion, may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A midsurface elasticity model for a thin, nonlinear, gradient elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a dynamic surface elasticity model for the two-dimensional midsurface of a thin, three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, nonlinear gradient elastic plate of thickness $h$. The resulting model is parameterized by five, conceivably measurable, physical properties of the plate, and the stored surface energy reduces to Koiter's plate energy in a singular limiting case. The model corrects a theoretical issue found in wave propagation in thin sheets and, when combined with the author's theory of Green elastic bodies possessing gradient elastic material boundary surfaces, removes the singularities present in fracture within traditional/classical models. Our approach diverges from previous research on thin shells and plates, which primarily concentrated on deriving elasticity theories for material surfaces from classical three-dimensional Green elasticity. This work is the first in rigorously developing a surface elasticity model based on a parent nonlinear gradient elasticity theory.</description>

      <title>Spectral Determinants of Almost Equilateral Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kirchoff's matrix tree theorem of 1847 connects the number of spanning trees of a graph to the spectral determinant of the discrete Laplacian [22]. Recently an analogue was obtained for quantum graphs relating the number of spanning trees to the spectral determinant of a Laplacian acting on functions on a metric graph with standard (Neumann-like) vertex conditions [20]. This result holds for quantum graphs where the edge lengths are close together. A quantum graph where the edge lengths are all equal is called equilateral. Here we consider equilateral graphs where we perturb the length of a single edge (almost equilateral graphs). We analyze the spectral determinant of almost equilateral complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and circulant graphs. This provides a measure of how fast the spectral determinant changes with respect to changes in an edge length. We apply these results to estimate the width of a window of edge lengths where the connection between the number of spanning trees and the spectral determinant can be observed. The results suggest the connection holds for a much wider window of edge lengths than is required in [20].</description>

      <title>Transport in multifractal Kraichnan flows: from turbulence to Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviors of fluid parcel trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection, obtained by coupling one-dimensional monofractal white-in-time Gaussian flows to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting random flows are characterized by the interplay between a smoothness exponent $\xi\in(0,2)$ controlling the correlation decay of the Gaussian component and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in (0,\sqrt 2)$ prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. In recent numerical work, this coupling was observed to induce a smoothing effect, whereby two-particle separations exhibit behavior similar to those in (monofractal) Gaussian flows only with increased smoothness exponent. The purpose of this work is to develop a rigorous theory of this phenomenon, contrasting the quenched setting where the GMC has prescribed realization to an annealed setting where the GMC is averaged over. Using the theory of 1D Markov processes we characterize the Lagrangian flow through boundary behaviors at the origin for the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$. This extends to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic transition and the coalescing/non-coalescing transition well known in the monofractal Kraichnan setting. We show that the separation process present some analogies with multiplicative 1D versions of the Liouville Brownian Motion, a canonical diffusion evolving within a random landscape induced by the GMC and previously introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both quenched and annealed phase diagrams are retrieved upon considering a multiplicative Liouville Brownian motion characterized by a smoothness parameter $\xi+\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Entropy Gain and Information Loss by Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.10364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the von Neumann entropy (VNE) of a system increases due to measurements, certain information is lost, some of which may be recoverable. We define information retrievability (IR) and information loss (IL) as functions of the density matrix through VNE to illustrate the relationship between gain and loss. We demonstrate that when a pure, unbiased m-qubit state collapses into a maximally mixed state, it experiences the maximal loss of information and the highest gain in entropy, equivalent to the m-bit classical Shannon entropy. We analyze the VNE, IR, and IL of single qubits, entangled photon pairs in Bell tests, three-qubit systems in quantum teleportation, multiple-qubit systems of GHZ and W states, and two-qubit Werner mixed states, emphasizing their IL dependence on parameters such as polarization bias and qubit count. Data exchange between two observers in Bell tests can recover some of the lost quantum information and eliminate the associated quantum entropy, even years later. The need to recover knowledge explains why no spooky action occurs at a distance. We show that measuring the Bell, GHZ, and marginally entangled Werner states yields the same minimum entropy gain (ln2) and equal minimal information loss (50 percent).</description>

      <title>Decomposing the Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlations between the energies of a system's spectrum are one of the defining features of quantum chaos. They can be probed using the Spectral Form Factor (SFF). We investigate how each spectral distance contributes in building this two-point correlation function. Specifically, starting from the spectral distribution of $k$-th neighbor level spacing ($k$nLS), we provide analytical expressions for the $k$-th neighbor Spectral Form Factor ($k$nSFF). We do so for the three Gaussian Random Matrix ensembles and the `Poissonian' ensemble of uncorrelated energy levels. We study the properties of the $k$nSFF, namely its minimum value and the time at which this minimum is reached, as well as the energy spacing with the deepest $k$nSFF. This allows us to quantify the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the SFF ramp, which is a characteristic feature of quantum chaos. In particular, we show how the onset of the ramp, characterized either by the dip or the Thouless time, shifts to shorter times as contributions from longer-range spectral distance are included. Interestingly, the even and odd neighbors contribute quite distinctively, the first being the most important to built the ramp. They respectively yield a resonance or antiresonance in the ramp. All of our analytical results are tested against numerical realizations of random matrices. We complete our analysis and show how the introduced tools help characterize the spectral properties of a physical many-body system by looking at the interacting XXZ Heisenberg model with local on-site disorder that allows transitioning between the chaotic and integrable regimes.</description>

      <title>Application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity in the form of an exponent into the original theory of Haldane. The dependence of the statistical correlation on indistinguishability is highlighted. Using this modified theory, a quasi-classical derivation of intermediate statistics is shown where indistinguishability can be introduced into distinguishable systems in the form of a statistical correlation. The final result is equivalent to the classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES), which was derived earlier using a purely classical route. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.</description>

      <title>Cosmic anisotropy and Bianchi Characterization: Killing vector fields and constructing their metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the largest scales the universe appears to be almost perfectly homogeneous and isotropic, adhering to the cosmological principle. On smaller scales inhomogeneities and anisotropies become increasingly prominent, reflecting the origin, emergence and formation of structure in the Universe and its cosmological impact. Also, a range of tensions between various cosmological observations may suggest it to be necessary to explore the consequences of such deviations from the ideal uniform universe. In this study, we restrict this to an investigation of anisotropies on the nature of the Universe. This motivates a more thorough understanding of the manifestation of anisotropy in cosmological applications. When letting go of the assumption of isotropy, spacetime metrics become homogeneous and completely anisotropic. As such, the Lie algebras of Killing vector fields will be 3D, and fit into the so-called 9-part Bianchi classification. This work strives to, given a suitable 3D Lie algebra of vector fields $\{\xi_a\}_{a=1,2,3}$ reconstruct the basis for a metric on which this Lie algebra is Killing. Through finding a determining equation for the frame invariant under $\{\xi_a\}$ and using the method of characteristics to solve it, expressions for said invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$ are obtained. This leads to general equations for the invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$, organized by Bianchi class. Some examples demonstrating this method are worked out.</description>

      <title>Feynman 1947 letter on path integral for the Dirac equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1947, four months before the famous Shelter Island conference, Richard Feynman wrote a lengthy letter to his former MIT classmate Theodore Welton, reporting on his efforts to develop a path integral describing the propagation of a Dirac particle. While these efforts never came to fruition, and were shortly abandoned in favor of a very different method of dealing with the electron propagator appearing in in QED, the letter is interesting both from the historical viewpoint of revealing what Feynman was thinking about during that period just before the development of QED, and for its scientific ideas. It also contains at the end some philosophical remarks, which Feynman wraps up with the comment, ``Well enough for the baloney.'' In this article I present a transcription of the letter along with editorial notes, and a facsimile of the original handwritten document. I also briefly comment on Feynman's efforts and discuss their relation to some later work.</description>

      <title>Linear response for random and sequential intermittent maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a quenched (trajectory-wise) linear response formula for random intermittent dynamical systems, consisting of Liverani-Saussol-Vaienti maps with varying parameters. This result complements recent annealed (averaged) results in the i.i.d setting. As an intermediate step, we show existence, uniqueness and statistical stability of the random absolutely continuous invariant probability measure (a.c.i.m.) for such non-uniformly expanding systems. Furthermore, we investigate sequential intermittent dynamical systems of this type and establish a linear response formula. Our arguments rely on the cone technique introduced by Baladi and Todd and further developed by Lepp{\"a}nen.
  We also demonstrate that sequential systems exhibit a subtle distinction from both random and autonomous settings: they may possess infinitely many sequential absolutely continuous equivariant densities. However, only one of these corresponds to an SRB state in the sense of Ruelle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1986, Albert proposed a Marsden-Weinstein reduction process for cosymplectic structures. In this paper, we present the limitations of this theory in the application of the reduction of symmetric time-dependent Hamiltonian systems. As a consequence, we conclude that cosymplectic geometry is not appropriate for this reduction. Motived for this fact, we replace cosymplectic structures by more general structures: mechanical presymplectic structures. Then, we develop Marsden-Weinstein reduction for this kind of structures and we apply this theory to interesting examples of time-dependent Hamiltonian systems for which Albert's reduction method doesn't work.</description>
