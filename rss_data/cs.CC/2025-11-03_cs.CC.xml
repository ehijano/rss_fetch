      <title>Unbounded-width CSPs are Untestable in a Sublinear Number of Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bounded-degree query model, introduced by Goldreich and Ron (\textit{Algorithmica, 2002}), is a standard framework in graph property testing and sublinear-time algorithms. Many properties studied in this model, such as bipartiteness and 3-colorability of graphs, can be expressed as satisfiability of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). We prove that for the entire class of \emph{unbounded-width} CSPs, testing satisfiability requires $\Omega(n)$ queries in the bounded-degree model. This result unifies and generalizes several previous lower bounds. In particular, it applies to all CSPs that are known to be $\mathbf{NP}$-hard to solve, including $k$-colorability of $\ell$-uniform hypergraphs for any $k,\ell \ge 2$ with $(k,\ell) \neq (2,2)$.
  Our proof combines the techniques from Bogdanov, Obata, and Trevisan (\textit{FOCS, 2002}), who established the first $\Omega(n)$ query lower bound for CSP testing in the bounded-degree model, with known results from universal algebra.</description>

      <title>Inclusive and Exclusive Vertex Splitting into Specific Graph Classes: NP Hardness and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26938v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of graph modification problems called the F-Vertex Splitting problem. Given a graph G, the task is to determine whether G can be transformed into a graph G-prime belonging to a graph class F through a sequence of at most k vertex splits. We investigate this problem for several target graph classes, namely constellations, cycle graphs, linear forests, and bipartite graphs. We analyze both inclusive and exclusive variants of vertex splitting, as introduced by Abu-Khzam and collaborators (ISCO 2018). Our results show that the F-Vertex Splitting problem is polynomial-time solvable when F is a cycle graph or a linear forest, for both variants. In contrast, when F is a constellation or a bipartite graph, the problem is NP-complete for both variants.</description>

      <title>Isotropy and completeness indices of multilinear maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structures of multilinear maps are characterized by invariants. In this paper we introduce two invariants, named the isotropy index and the completeness index. These invariants capture the tensorial structure of the kernel of a multilinear map. We establish bounds on both indices in terms of the partition rank, geometric rank, analytic rank and height, and present three applications: 1) Using the completeness index as an interpolator, we establish upper bounds on the aforementioned tensor ranks in terms of the subrank. This settles an open problem raised by Kopparty, Moshkovitz and Zuiddam, and consequently answers a question of Derksen, Makam and Zuiddam. 2) We prove a Ramsey-type theorem for the two indices, generalizing a recent result of Qiao and confirming a conjecture of his. 3) By computing the completeness index, we obtain a polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm to estimate the height of a polynomial ideal.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time-Space Tradeoffs for Matrix Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the time and space required for quantum computers to solve a wide variety of problems involving matrices, many of which have only been analyzed classically in prior work. Our main results show that for a range of linear algebra problems -- including matrix-vector product, matrix inversion, matrix multiplication and powering -- existing classical time-space tradeoffs, several of which are tight for every space bound, also apply to quantum algorithms. For example, for almost all matrices $A$, including the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, we prove that quantum circuits with at most $T$ input queries and $S$ qubits of memory require $T=\Omega(n^2/S)$ to compute matrix-vector product $Ax$ for $x \in \{0,1\}^n$. We similarly prove that matrix multiplication for $n\times n$ binary matrices requires $T=\Omega(n^3 / \sqrt{S})$. Because many of our lower bounds match deterministic algorithms with the same time and space complexity, we show that quantum computers cannot provide any asymptotic advantage for these problems with any space bound. We obtain matching lower bounds for the stronger notion of quantum cumulative memory complexity -- the sum of the space per layer of a circuit.
  We also consider Boolean (i.e. AND-OR) matrix multiplication and matrix-vector products, improving the previous quantum time-space tradeoff lower bounds for $n\times n$ Boolean matrix multiplication to $T=\Omega(n^{2.5}/S^{1/4})$ from $T=\Omega(n^{2.5}/S^{1/2})$.
  Our improved lower bound for Boolean matrix multiplication is based on a new coloring argument that extracts more from the strong direct product theorem used in prior work. Our tight lower bounds for linear algebra problems require adding a new bucketing method to the recording-query technique of Zhandry that lets us apply classical arguments to upper bound the success probability of quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Automating $\mathbf{TC}^0$-Frege Is LWE-Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the first hardness results against efficient proof search by quantum algorithms. We show that under Learning with Errors (LWE), the standard lattice-based cryptographic assumption, no quantum algorithm can weakly automate $\mathbf{TC}^0$-Frege. This extends the line of results of Kraj\'i\v{c}ek and Pudl\'ak (Information and Computation, 1998), Bonet, Pitassi, and Raz (FOCS, 1997), and Bonet, Domingo, Gavald\`a, Maciel, and Pitassi (Computational Complexity, 2004), who showed that Extended Frege, $\mathbf{TC}^0$-Frege and $\mathbf{AC}^0$-Frege, respectively, cannot be weakly automated by classical algorithms if either the RSA cryptosystem or the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol are secure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first interaction between quantum computation and propositional proof search.</description>
