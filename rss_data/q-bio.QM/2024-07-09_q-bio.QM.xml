      <title>Novel second-order model for tumor evolution: description of cytostatic and cytotoxic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer is a disease that takes millions of lives every year. Then, to propose treatments, avoid recurrence, and improve the patient's life quality, we need to analyze this disease from a biophysical perspective with a solid mathematical formulation. In this paper we introduce a novel deterministic model for the evolution of tumors under several conditions (untreated tumors and treated tumors using chemotherapy). Our model is characterized by a second-order differential equation, whose origin and interpretation are presented by exploiting our understanding of fluid mechanics (via continuity equations) and the theory of differential equations. Additionally, we show that our model can fit various experimental data sets. Thus, we prove that our nuanced and general model can describe accelerated growth, as well as cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. All in all, our model opens up a new window in the understanding of tumor evolution and represents a promising connection between the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of cancer.</description>

      <title>The Emergent Aging Model: Aging as an Emergent Property of Biological Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the study of cellular aging using the single-cell model organism of budding yeast and corroborated by other studies, we propose the Emergent Aging Model (EAM). EAM hypothesizes that aging is an emergent property of complex biological systems, exemplified by biological networks such as gene networks. An emergent property refers to traits that a system has at the system level but which its low-level components do not. EAM is based on a quantitative definition of aging using the mortality rate. A biological entity with a constant mortality rate is considered non-aging which is equivalent to a first-order chemical reaction. Aging can be quantitatively defined as an increasing mortality rate over time, corresponding to an organism's increasing chance of dying over time. EAM posits that biological aging can arise at the system level of an organism, even if the system is composed of only non-aging components. EAM is consistent with the observation that aging is largely stochastic, influenced by numerous genes and epigenetic factors, with no single gene or factor known as the bona fide cause of aging. A parsimonious version of EAM can predict the Gompertz model of biological aging, the Strehler-Mildvan correlation, and the trade-off between initial reproductive fitness (asexual reproductive fitness) and late-life survival. EAM has been applied to experimental results of the replicative lifespan of the budding yeast and can potentially offer new insights into the aging process of other biological species.</description>

      <title>Protein-environment-sensitive computational epitope accessibility analysis from antibody dose-response data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibodies are widely used in life-sciences and medical therapy. Yet, broadly applicable methods are missing to determine, in the biological system of choice, antibody specificity and its quantitative contribution to e.g. immunofluorescence stainings. Thereby, antibody-based data often needs to be seen with caution. Here, we present a simple-to-use approach to characterize and quantify antibody binding properties directly in the system of choice. We determine an epitope accessibility distribution in the system of interest based on a computational analysis of antibody-dilution immunofluorescence stainings. This allows the selection of specific antibodies, the choice of a dilution to maximize signal-specificity, and an improvement of signal quantification. It further expands the scope of antibody-based imaging to detect changes of the subcellular nano-environment and allows for antibody multiplexing.</description>

      <title>Cellular diffusion processes in singularly perturbed domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many processes in cell biology that can be modeled in terms of particles diffusing in a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$ containing a set of small subdomains or interior compartments $\calU_j$, $j=1,\ldots,N$ (singularly-perturbed diffusion problems). The domain $\Omega$ could represent the cell membrane, the cell cytoplasm, the cell nucleus or the extracellular volume, while an individual compartment could represent a synapse, a membrane protein cluster, a biological condensate, or a quorum sensing bacterial cell. In this review we use a combination of matched asymptotic analysis and Green's function methods to solve a general type of singular boundary value problems (BVP) in 2D and 3D, in which an inhomogeneous Robin condition is imposed on each interior boundary $\partial \calU_j$. This allows us to incorporate a variety of previous studies of singularly perturbed diffusion problems into a single mathematical modeling framework. We mainly focus on steady-state solutions and the approach to steady-state, but also highlight some of the current challenges in dealing with time-dependent solutions and randomly switching processes</description>

      <title>Structured methods for parameter inference and uncertainty quantification for mechanistic models in the life sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter inference and uncertainty quantification are important steps when relating mathematical models to real-world observations, and when estimating uncertainty in model predictions. However, methods for doing this can be computationally expensive, particularly when the number of unknown model parameters is large. The aim of this study is to develop and test an efficient profile likelihood-based method, which takes advantage of the structure of the mathematical model being used. We do this by identifying specific parameters that affect model output in a known way, such as a linear scaling. We illustrate the method by applying it to three caricature models from different areas of the life sciences: (i) a predator-prey model from ecology; (ii) a compartment-based epidemic model from health sciences; and, (iii) an advection-diffusion-reaction model describing transport of dissolved solutes from environmental science. We show that the new method produces results of comparable accuracy to existing profile likelihood methods, but with substantially fewer evaluations of the forward model. We conclude that our method could provide a much more efficient approach to parameter inference for models where a structured approach is feasible. Code to apply the new method to user-supplied models and data is provided via a publicly accessible repository.</description>

      <title>Categorization of 31 computational methods to detect spatially variable genes from spatially resolved transcriptomics data</title>

Abstract: In the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics data, detecting spatially variable genes (SVGs) is crucial. Numerous computational methods exist, but varying SVG definitions and methodologies lead to incomparable results. We review 31 state-of-the-art methods, categorizing SVGs into three types: overall, cell-type-specific, and spatial-domain-marker SVGs. Our review explains the intuitions underlying these methods, summarizes their applications, and categorizes the hypothesis tests they use in the trade-off between generality and specificity for SVG detection. We discuss challenges in SVG detection and propose future directions for improvement. Our review offers insights for method developers and users, advocating for category-specific benchmarking.</description>

      <title>A Fine-tuning Dataset and Benchmark for Large Language Models for Protein Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parallels between protein sequences and natural language in their sequential structures have inspired the application of large language models (LLMs) to protein understanding. Despite the success of LLMs in NLP, their effectiveness in comprehending protein sequences remains an open question, largely due to the absence of datasets linking protein sequences to descriptive text. Researchers have then attempted to adapt LLMs for protein understanding by integrating a protein sequence encoder with a pre-trained LLM. However, this adaptation raises a fundamental question: "Can LLMs, originally designed for NLP, effectively comprehend protein sequences as a form of language?" Current datasets fall short in addressing this question due to the lack of a direct correlation between protein sequences and corresponding text descriptions, limiting the ability to train and evaluate LLMs for protein understanding effectively. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProteinLMDataset, a dataset specifically designed for further self-supervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs to enhance their capability for protein sequence comprehension. Specifically, ProteinLMDataset includes 17.46 billion tokens for pretraining and 893,000 instructions for SFT. Additionally, we present ProteinLMBench, the first benchmark dataset consisting of 944 manually verified multiple-choice questions for assessing the protein understanding capabilities of LLMs. ProteinLMBench incorporates protein-related details and sequences in multiple languages, establishing a new standard for evaluating LLMs' abilities in protein comprehension. The large language model InternLM2-7B, pretrained and fine-tuned on the ProteinLMDataset, outperforms GPT-4 on ProteinLMBench, achieving the highest accuracy score.</description>

Abstract: Logical modeling is a powerful tool in biology, offering a system-level understanding of the complex interactions that govern biological processes. A gap that hinders the scalability of logical models is the need to specify the update function of every vertex in the network depending on the status of its predecessors. To address this, we introduce in this paper the concept of strong regulation, where a vertex is only updated to active/inactive if all its predecessors agree in their influences; otherwise, it is set to ambiguous. We explore the interplay between active, inactive, and ambiguous influences in a network. We discuss the existence of phenotype attractors in such networks, where the status of some of the variables is fixed to active/inactive, while the others can have an arbitrary status, including ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Identifiable specializations for ODE models</title>

Abstract: The parameter identifiability problem for a dynamical system is to determine whether the parameters of the system can be found from data for the outputs of the system. Verifying whether the parameters are identifiable is a necessary first step before a meaningful parameter estimation can take place. Non-identifiability occurs in practical models. To reparametrize a model to achieve identifiability is a challenge. The existing approaches have been shown to be useful for many important examples. However, these approaches are either limited to linear models and scaling parametrizations or are not guaranteed to find a reparametrization even if it exists. In the present paper, we prove that there always exists a locally identifiable model with the same input-output behaviour as the original one obtained from a given one by a partial specialization of the parameters. As an extra feature of our approach, the resulting (at least) locally identifiable reparameterization has the same shape: the monomials in the new state variables in the new model are formed in the same way as in the original model. Furthermore, we give a sufficient observability condition for the existence of a state space transformation from the original model to the new one. Our proof is constructive and can be translated to an algorithm, which we illustrate by several examples.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Protein-Ligand Docking: Are We There Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of ligand binding on protein structures and their in vivo functions carry numerous implications for modern biomedical research and biotechnology development efforts such as drug discovery. Although several deep learning (DL) methods and benchmarks designed for protein-ligand docking have recently been introduced, to date no prior works have systematically studied the behavior of docking methods within the practical context of (1) using predicted (apo) protein structures for docking (e.g., for broad applicability); (2) docking multiple ligands concurrently to a given target protein (e.g., for enzyme design); and (3) having no prior knowledge of binding pockets (e.g., for pocket generalization). To enable a deeper understanding of docking methods' real-world utility, we introduce PoseBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for practical protein-ligand docking. PoseBench enables researchers to rigorously and systematically evaluate DL docking methods for apo-to-holo protein-ligand docking and protein-ligand structure generation using both single and multi-ligand benchmark datasets, the latter of which we introduce for the first time to the DL community. Empirically, using PoseBench, we find that all recent DL docking methods but one fail to generalize to multi-ligand protein targets and also that template-based docking algorithms perform equally well or better for multi-ligand docking as recent single-ligand DL docking methods, suggesting areas of improvement for future work. Code, data, tutorials, and benchmark results are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PoseBench.</description>
