      <title>Energy gap of quantum spin glasses: a projection quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization is fundamentally limited by the minimum energy gap $\Delta$ encountered at quantum phase transitions. We investigate the scaling of $\Delta$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $\Delta$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $\Delta \propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity.</description>

      <title>Transport in close-packed solids with stacking defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium and sodium are the only solids that are known to lose crystalline order upon cooling. The seemingly-disordered low-temperature phase shows signatures of various close-packed structures. The lack of order has been attributed to a hidden gauge symmetry that arises when electrons from one layer can hop to a neighbouring layer but not further. It makes all close-packed structures nearly degenerate and leads to ``structural frustration''. In this article, we examine whether this symmetry is reflected in transport signatures. Taking advantage of in-plane translational periodicity, we map the bulk Bloch Hamiltonian to an effective one-dimensional chain, with stacking disorder mapping to random phases of the hopping amplitudes. We derive an explicit analytic form for the Green's function of electrons and use it to calculate conductance of a bulk crystal. When hopping in the effective one-dimensional chain is restricted to nearest neighbours, conductance is completely insensitive to phase disorder, which indicates that all close-packed structures exhibit the same conductance. We show that the leading correction that can differentiate between close-packed structures arises from hopping to the next-nearest-neighbour layer, equivalent to second-neighbour hopping in the chain model. This process appears when a pair of next-neighbour layers are aligned in a certain way, e.g., at an hcp-like stacking fault within an fcc background. With this hopping included, conductance becomes sensitive to the precise arrangement of layers. When multiple stacking faults are present, the conductance decreases with increasing system size, as expected from Anderson localization. Our results are applicable to pressurized lithium and sodium, where conductance measurements can identify and characterize stacking faults.</description>

      <title>Training overdamped dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In regimes where inertia is negligible, the temporal evolution is governed by overdamped dynamics. This limit is particularly relevant in soft-matter contexts, such as polymers, colloidal suspensions, and processes occurring at the cellular scale. Being able to manipulate the dynamics of such many-particle systems would enable control over rate-dependent elastic responses, time-dependent material properties, relaxation processes, and perhaps the hydrodynamics of suspensions. In this work, we develop a framework for manipulating overdamped dynamics through local, physically motivated update rules. Our approach is inspired by ideas from physical learning and directed aging, in which microscopic parameters adapt autonomously to endow a material with a desired function. Using the Rayleighian formulation, whose minimization reproduces the overdamped equations of motion, we derive approximate directed-aging and equilibrium-propagation rules tailored to dissipative systems. To demonstrate these ideas, we study a disordered Maxwell material that behaves elastically at short times but flows at long times. By locally modifying the viscous damping, we show that one can tune the viscous Poisson's ratio and shape local mechanical responses. These results illustrate how materials can be trained to exhibit targeted rate-dependent elastic and viscous behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Regularized Neural Network and Kirchhoff Markov Random Field Framework for Inferring Internal Electrochemical States from Operando Spectromicroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative understanding of coupled reaction and transport processes in lithium-ion battery (LIB) composite electrodes remains challenging because key internal states cannot be measured directly. In this study, we develop a physics-integrated, data-driven analysis pipeline to estimate internal electrochemical states from operando microscopic X-ray absorption fine structure ($\mu$-XAFS) hyperspectral data of LIB cathodes with LiPF$_6$ electrolyte. State-of-charge (SOC) maps are first constructed from Co K-edge spectra. To resolve ambiguities in the two-phase reaction region, a physics-regularized three-layer neural network is introduced, enforcing spatial continuity of SOC and current conservation. The inferred SOC dynamics are then incorporated into a Kirchhoff-based Markov random field framework that integrates Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, Ohm's law, and a symmetric Butler-Volmer relation to estimate interfacial current, ionic current, electrolyte potential, and effective ionic conductivity. Application to composite electrodes with different initial electrolyte concentrations (0.3, 1, and 2M LiPF$_6$) reveals distinct reaction propagation behaviors governed by electrolyte concentration-dependent conductivity. The inferred electrolyte concentration distributions show qualitative agreement with independent operando X-ray transmission imaging performed on LIB composite cathodes employing a LiAsF$_6$ electrolyte. This framework enables quantitative visualization of otherwise inaccessible internal transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Infinitely fast critical dynamics: Teleportation through temporal rare regions in monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time, remaining spatially uniform at each time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with ``ultrafast'' dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits. The implications of our results on the general stability of phase transitions and ordered phases to such temporal randomness are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dual-Spaces Invariance as a Universal Criterion for Identifying Multifractal Critical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Anderson localization physics, eigenstates of disordered quantum systems are commonly classified as extended, localized, or critical, distinguished by their distinct spatial structures in real space. While critical states are known to exhibit multifractal characteristics, a precise and operational criterion for characterizing critical states remains an open challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by revisiting criticality from a dual-spaces perspective that treats position and momentum representations on equal footing. Building on the Liu--Xia criterion, which characterizes critical states by the simultaneous vanishing of Lyapunov exponents ($\gamma=\gamma_m=0$) in both spaces, we show that this dual-spaces characterization captures an essential feature of critical states that is not limited to Lyapunov exponents. In particular, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inverse participation ratio exhibits closely related scaling behavior in position and momentum space for critical states. This position-momentum correspondence clearly distinguishes critical states from extended or localized ones, which instead display a pronounced asymmetry between the two representations. Our results establish a robust and universal framework for precisely characterizing multifractal critical states in disordered quantum systems, and provide practical guidance for their identification in current quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Non-zero Momentum Implies Long-Range Entanglement When Translation Symmetry is Broken in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A result by Gioia and Wang [Phys Rev X 12, 031007 (2022)] showed that translationally symmetric states having nonzero momentum are necessarily long range entangled (LRE). Here, we consider the question: can a notion of momentum for non-translation symmetric states directly encode the nature of their entanglement, as it does for translation symmetric states? We show the answer is affirmative for 1D systems, while higher dimensional extensions and topologically ordered systems require further work. While Gioia and Wang's result applies to states connected via finite depth quantum circuits to a translation symmetric state, it is often impractical to find such a circuit to determine the nature of the entanglement of states that break translation symmetry. Here, instead of translation eigenstates, we focus on the many-body momentum distribution and the expectation value of the translation operator in many-body states of systems having broken translation symmetry. We show that in the continuum limit the magnitude of the expectation value of the translation operator $|&lt;T&gt;|$ necessarily goes to $1$ for delocalized states, a proxy for LRE states in 1D systems. This result can be seen as a momentum-space version of Resta's formula for the localization length. We investigate how accurate our results are in different lattice models with and without well-defined continuum limits. To that end, we introduce two models: a deterministic version of the random dimer model, illustrating the role of the thermodynamic and continuum limits for our result at a lattice level, and a simplified version of the Aubry-Andre model, with commensurate hopping for both momentum and position space. Finally, we use the random dimer model as a test case for the accuracy of $|&lt;T&gt;|$ as a localization (and thus entanglement) probe for 1D periodic lattice models without a well-defined continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Multiplexity amplifies geometry in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world network are multilayer, with nontrivial correlations across layers. Here we show that these correlations amplify geometry in networks. We focus on mutual clustering--a measure of the amount of triangles that are present in all layers among the same triplets of nodes--and find that this clustering is abnormally high in many real-world networks, even when clustering in each individual layer is weak. We explain this unexpected phenomenon using a simple multiplex network model with latent geometry: links that are most congruent with this geometry are the ones that persist across layers, amplifying the cross-layer triangle overlap. This result reveals a different dimension in which multilayer networks are radically distinct from their constituent layers.</description>
