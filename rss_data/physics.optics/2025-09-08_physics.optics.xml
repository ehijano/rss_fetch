      <title>Bound-state-in-the-continuum (BIC) induced narrow resonances in MXene-coated absorptive dielectric metasurfaces for Methane sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light confinement is highly necessary for various applications, including sensing. MXene, a novel and emerging material with a broadband plasmonic response, has been highly utilized in electronic sensing systems, as well has garnered significant attention for its applicability in photonics. The loss imparted by MXene can be overcome through the Bound States in Continuum (BIC) physics. In this work, we report two important designs of a hybrid metasurface, comprising a silicon nanodisk metasurface and MXene. In both designs, narrow and high absorption resonance of quality factor of $\sim$150 is attained, where MD is the dominant multipole, governed by symmetry-protected BIC. Both hybrid metasurface designs are optimized to exhibit narrow resonance in the vicinity of 1650 nm with an absorption greater than 90 $\%$. The origin of high absorbance in such a hybrid metasurface is attributed to the momentum matching by the spacer layer of $SiO_2$. The spectral characteristics of the designed metasurface can be utilized for first overtone spectroscopy of Methane gas. Numerical simulations yield a bulk refractive index sensitivity of 171 nm/RIU with FOM = 17.56 $RIU^{-1}$ and sensitivity for Methane gas, S = 0.8 nm per unit percentage concentration, when a Cryptophane-E layer is used.</description>

      <title>A scalable method for cavity-enhanced solid-state quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoluminescent color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are powerful nanoscale solid-state quantum sensors that are explored in a plethora of quantum technologies. Methods for integrating them into macroscopic structures that improve their sensitivity and enable their large-scale deployment are highly sought after. Here, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced photoluminescence (PL) of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) and hBN nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in polymer-based thin-film optical cavities on the centimeter scale. The cavity resonances efficiently modulate the spectral PL peak position of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in FNDs across the NV PL spectrum and lead to an up to 2.9-fold Purcell-enhancement of the NV PL decay rate. The brightness of hBN NPs increases by up to a factor of three and the PL decay rate is enhanced by up to 13-fold inside the cavities. Finally, we find a 4.8 times improved magnetic field sensitivity of 20 nm FNDs in thin-film cavities due to cavity-enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance contrast and PL brightness. Our study demonstrates a low-cost and scalable method for the fabrication of quantum sensor-doped thin-film cavities, which is an important step toward the development of advanced quantum sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Million-Q Dual-Polarization Micro-Fabry-Perot Resonators in Silicon Nitride Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturized Fabry-Perot standing-wave resonators and whispering-gallery travelling wave resonators constitute foundational building blocks for photonic integrated circuits. While both architectures offer transformative potential through high quality factors and dual-polarization operation, integrated Fabry-Perot resonators face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving ultra-high Q-factors and broadband thermal tunability for fundamental transverse magnetic (TM0) and transverse electric (TE0) modes within a compact footprint-primarily due to polarization-dependent losses in conventional chip-scale reflectors. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating an integrated silicon nitride dual-polarization micro-Fabry-Perot resonator with polarization-insensitive Sagnac loop reflectors and multimode waveguides to effectively suppress losses and enable high-performances for both fundamental transverse magnetic (TM0) and transverse electric (TE0) modes. The device achieves record loaded quality factors of 2.38*106 (TM0) and 3.48*105 (TE0) respectively and intrinsic quality factors will be even higher. Moreover, both two modes are tuned over the whole free spectral range of around 0.111 nm (TM0) and 0.112 nm (TE0) with the thermal tuning efficiencies of approximately 1.04 pm/mW (TM0) and 1.24 pm/mW (TE0). These advances establish a new benchmark for compact, high-performance dual-polarization resonators in optical sensors, nonlinear and integrated quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Observation of Arbitrarily Configurable Nonlinear Topological Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear topology is an emerging field that combines the intrinsic reconfigurability of nonlinear systems with the robustness of topological protection, offering fertile ground for unconventional phenomena and novel applications. Recently, arbitrarily configurable nonlinear topological modes (ANTMs) were proposed, enabling wavefunctions to be configured into arbitrary profiles , and offering greatly enhanced capacity for topological modes and high-throughput topological transport. Here we present the first direct experimental demonstration of ANTMs . These nonlinear topological modes are robust against disorder while also being continuously reshaped and reconfigured in real time through external control. These counterintuitive properties highlight the versatility of arbitrarily morphing nonlinear topological modes and pave the way for highly adaptable topological devices capable of operating reliably across diverse application scenarios, including those involving imperfections, signal variability, and dynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Impact of noise on nonlinear-exceptional-point-based sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear exceptional points (NEPs), a new type of spectral singularity in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems, are expected to address the noise divergence issue encountered at linear exceptional points and are therefore under the scrutiny of theoretical and experimental investigations. However, concerns have been raised that NEPs may hinder improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of sensors, and there is currently no rigorous theoretical framework to characterize noise effects in NEPs, particularly when accounting for the inherent nonlinear feedback. Here, we develop a new theoretical framework to address the impact of noise on NEP-based sensors, effectively resolving these concerns. The interplay between noise and nonlinearity keeps the average frequency virtually unchanged. In addition, a hidden feedback mechanism limits the increase in detectable uncertainty, together enabling a substantial SNR enhancement at NEPs. Our results resolve the ongoing debate over the SNR of NEPs and lay the groundwork for NEP-based sensor technologies.</description>

      <title>Broadband Simultaneous Beam Steering and Compressing Device Based on Subwavelength Protrusion Metallic Tunnels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam steering and beamwidth compressing play a role in steering the beam and narrowing its half-power beamwidth, respectively, which are both widely applied in extending the effective operational range of 6G communications, IoT devices, and antenna systems. However, research on wave manipulation devices capable of simultaneously achieving both functionalities remains limited, despite their great potential for system miniaturization and functional integration. In this study, we design and realize a broadband device capable of simultaneously steering and compressing the TM-polarized EM waves using subwavelength protrusion metallic tunnels. The underlying physical mechanisms are quantitatively explained through wave optics and optical surface transformation, indicating the size ratio between the incident and output surface governs both the steering angle and the compression ratio. Numerical simulations demonstrate its outstanding performance, achieving a maximum steering angle of 40{\deg} and a compression ratio of 0.4 across 3 to 12 GHz, with averaged energy transmittance above 80%. The experiments further validate its effectiveness by measuring the magnetic field distributions of the output beam at various frequencies. The excellent beam steering and compressing effects make the proposed device highly promising for next-generation multifunctional wave manipulation in advanced communication systems.</description>

      <title>Accessible, All-Polymer Metasurfaces: Low Effort, High Quality Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces supporting resonances with high quality factors offer an outstanding platform for applications such as non-linear optics, light guiding, lasing, sensing, light-matter coupling, and quantum optics. However, their experimental realization typically demands elaborate multi-step procedures such as metal or dielectric deposition, lift-off, and reactive ion etching. As a consequence, accessibility, large-scale production and sustainability are constrained by reliance on cost-, time- and labor-intensive facilities. We overcome this fabrication hurdle by repurposing polymethyl methacrylate-which is usually employed as a temporary resist-as the resonator material, thereby eliminating all steps except for spin-coating, exposure and development. Because the low refractive index of the polymer limits effective mode formation, we present a bilayer recipe that enables the convenient fabrication of a freestanding membrane to maximize the index contrast with its surroundings. Since etching induced defects are circumvented, the membrane features high quality nanopatterns. We further examine the suspended membrane with scanning electron microscopy and extract its position-dependent spring constant and pretension with nanoindentation experiments applied by the tip of an atomic force microscope. Our all-polymer metasurface hosting Bound States in the Continuum experimentally delivers high quality factors (up to 523) at visible and near infrared wavelengths, despite the low refractive index of the polymer, and enables straightforward geometry-based tuning of both linewidth and resonance position. We envision this methodology to lay the groundwork for accessible, high performance metasurfaces with unique use cases such as material blending, angled writing and mechanically based resonance tuning.</description>

      <title>Topological pumping of light governed by Fibonacci numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological pumping refers to transfer of a physical quantity governed by the systemtopology, resulting in quantized amounts of the transferred quantities. It is a ubiqui-tous wave phenomenon typically considered subject to exactly periodic adiabatic vari-ation of the system parameters. Recently, proposals for generalizing quasi-periodictopological pumping and identifying possible physical settings for its implementa-tion have emerged. In a strict sense, pumping with incommensurate frequencies canonly manifest over infinite evolution distances, raising a fundamental question aboutits observability in real-world finite-dimensional systems. Here we demonstrate thatbi-chromatic topological pumping with two frequencies, whose ratio is an irrationalnumber, can be viewed as the convergence limit of pumping with two commensuratefrequencies representing the best rational approximations of that irrational number. In our experiment, this phenomenon is observed as the displacement of a light beamcenter in photorefractive crystals induced by two optical lattices. The longitudinalperiods of the lattices, that in the paraxial approximation emulate two pumping fre-quencies, are related as Fibonacci numbers, successively approaching the golden ratio. We observed that a one-cycle displacement of the beam center at each successiveapproximation is determined by the relation between successive Fibonacci numbers,while the average direction of propagation (emulating average pumping velocity) ofthe beam is determined by the golden ratio.</description>

      <title>Photon Bose-Einstein Condensation in Semiconductors: A Quantum Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon condensation in semiconductor microcavities is a transformative technique for engineering quantum states of light at room temperature by tailoring strong but incoherent light-matter interactions. While continuous-wave and electrical pumping offer exceptional prospects for miniaturized quantum photonic technologies, harnessing these requires conceptual advances in understanding nonequilibrium light-matter dynamics in semiconductors. We resolve this challenge through an \textit{ab initio} quantum kinetic theory capturing how Coulomb interactions of optically excited carriers and phonon scattering mediate photon thermalization and condensation in semiconductors. Our microscopic model shows that at high carrier densities, thermalization is dominated by carrier-carrier Coulomb scattering, in clear contrast to the rovibrational relaxation that governs dye-based photon condensates. The theory predicts a rich nonequilibrium phase diagram with thermal, Bose-condensed, multimode, and lasing phases, quantitatively in agreement with recent experiments. Crucially, we identify how cavity detuning controls transitions between equilibrium and gain-dominated regimes, enabling tailored design of coherent light sources. This work thus provides the foundation for semiconductor-based quantum photonic devices operating beyond conventional laser paradigms.</description>

      <title>Label-Free Whole Slide Virtual Multi-Staining Using Dual-Excitation Photon Absorption Remote Sensing Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histochemical staining is essential for visualizing tissue architecture and cellular morphology but is destructive and limited by the availability of tissue for multiple stains. Virtual staining with label-free microscopy offers a non-destructive alternative, enabling multiple stains to be generated from the same section while reducing stain variability and preserving tissue for downstream assays. Here, a new dual-excitation Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS) system is presented, representing the first application of long-wave ultraviolet A (UVA) 355 nm excitation alongside the established UVC 266 nm source. The addition of 355 nm extends PARS contrast beyond 266 nm, enhancing stromal visualization (e.g., collagen, elastin) and capturing red blood cells, melanin, and other features through complementary radiative and non-radiative absorption. The 266 nm and 355 nm pulses interrogate the sample in an interlaced fashion, enabling concurrent acquisition without compromising imaging speed. Using the RegGAN image-translation framework, this work presents the first demonstration of PARS virtual staining across multiple specialized stains, including Masson's trichrome, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Jones' silver, in addition to hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), across diverse human and murine tissues. A masked evaluation by expert pathologists showed that virtual stains achieved the same diagnostic quality as their chemical counterparts, and pathologists could not reliably distinguish real from virtual stains. By providing label-free multi-stain outputs from a single scan, dual-excitation PARS virtual staining could integrate into digital pathology workflows, expanding diagnostic utility. Real and virtual whole-slide image (WSI) pairs are publicly available at the BioImage Archive (https://doi.org/10.6019/S-BIAD2232).</description>

      <title>High-pulse-energy integrated mode-locked lasers based on a Mamyshev oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast lasers have unlocked numerous advances across science and technology: they enable corneal surgery, reveal chemical reaction dynamics, and underpin optical atomic clocks. Over the past decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing photonic integrated circuit-based mode-locked lasers that are compact, scalable, and compatible with further on-chip functionalities. Yet, existing implementations fall short of pulse energies required for their subsequent uses in nonlinear applications. In this work, we demonstrate the first mode-locked laser that overcomes this limitation in low-loss erbium-doped silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. The laser is based on the Mamyshev oscillator architecture, which employs alternating spectral filtering and self-phase modulation for mode-locking. It delivers a 176 MHz stream of pulses with nanojoule energy, comparable to fiber lasers and surpassing previous photonic integrated sources by more than two orders of magnitude. The output pulses exhibit excellent coherence, can be linearly compressed to 147 fs and directly drive a 1.5-octave-spanning supercontinuum in an integrated waveguide. Our work establishes a new generation of high-pulse-energy photonic integrated mode-locked lasers and paves the way for their widespread adoption.</description>

      <title>Topology and criticality in non-Hermitian multimodal optical resonators through engineered losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological matter provides a platform for engineering phenomena that go beyond the capabilities of Hermitian systems, enabling the use of losses to engineer topological phenomena. Non-Hermitian models often rely on artificial platforms made of engineered lattices because controlling losses in natural compounds is challenging. Although typical models for non-Hermitian photonic matter are often single mode, photonic systems are often multimodal, producing mixing between different normal modes in each site. In this work, we explore a generalized family of multimodal non-Hermitian lattices, featuring multiple resonant modes. We show that these multimodal models are capable of featuring topological modes and criticality, similar to the artificial single-mode models often considered. We analyze the robustness of these non-Hermitian topological modes to fluctuation of local losses, disorder, and artificial gauge field. We show that these effects can be captured via both a full microscopic model and effective multiorbital models. Specifically, we show that due to their multiorbital nature, the localization properties of non-Hermitian multiorbital models can be controlled by an external gauge field. Our results demonstrate that internal orbital degrees of freedom provide a promising strategy to engineer controllable non-Hermitian topology and criticality.</description>

      <title>Fast 360{\deg} 3D Metrology for Directed Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed Energy Deposition (DED) is a metal additive manufacturing process capable of building and repairing large, complex metal parts from a wide range of alloys. Its flexibility makes it attractive for multiple industrial applications, e.g., in aerospace, automotive and biomedical fields. However, errors or defects introduced at any stage of the printing process can, if undetected, significantly impact the final result, rendering the printed part unusable. Potential in-situ correction methods of printing defects require fast and high-resolution on-the-fly 3D inspection inside the machine, but existing 3D monitoring methods often lack full 360{\deg} 3D coverage, require bulky setups, or are too slow for real-time layer-wise feedback. In this paper, we present a single-shot, multi-view polarized fringe projection profilometry (FPP) system designed for real-time in-situ 3D inspection during DED printing. Multiple camera-projector pairs are arranged around the deposition surface to measure depth from different viewpoints in single-shot, while cross-polarized image filtering suppresses specular reflections caused by varying surface reflectance across different alloys. The final 360{\deg} reconstruction is obtained via joint registration of the captured multi-view measurements. Our prototype has been deployed in a DED system and our first experiments demonstrate a depth precision better than $\delta z &lt; 50\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ on partially reflective and "shiny" metal surfaces, enabling accurate, layer-wise monitoring for closed-loop DED control.</description>

Abstract: Photon correlations represent a central resource in many quantum optics experiments, with applications ranging from quantum information protocols to sensing. Engineering such correlations is often challenging, especially in multi-particle scenarios. In this work we describe an effective method for shaping spatial correlations between photons by patterning their distinguishability in a quantum interference setup. We show how to write and edit these bi-photon correlations between the two output channels of a beam-splitter, hiding this encoded information from conventional intensity measurements. Our scheme offers an easy extension to multiparticle scenarios and facilitates the transmission of high-dimensional quantum information, with potential applications to quantum communication and imaging protocols.</description>

      <title>Pose-Free 3D Quantitative Phase Imaging of Flowing Cellular Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging. By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations, providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis in flow cytometry platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-division multiplexing using multimode optical fibers has been applied to quantum-level signals with time-bin and phase encoding, achieving Mqubits per second over 8 km of few-mode fiber. The dead time of single-photon detectors, typically considered a bottleneck in quantum transmission, is effectively utilized here to eliminate modal cross-talk between quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Continuum Landau surface states in a non-Hermitian Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface states of topological phases, which owe their existence to bulk topological band invariants, possess many features of deep physical significance. In some instances, they can be linked to a quantum anomaly: the violation of a classical symmetry by a field theory through the emergence of a non-conserved current. This phenomenon was recently generalized to the non-Hermitian (NH) regime, in the form of an NH chiral anomaly occurring in the surfaces states of an NH Weyl phase. Here, we show that the anomalous NH current is mediated by continnum Landau modes (CLMs) an exotic class of NH eigenstates exhibiting both spatial localization and a continuous spectrum, contrary to the usual distinction between bound and free states. The conditions for which CLMs are normalized, and their scaling of localization length with magnetic field strength, are found to match the requirements of the NH anomaly equation. We also discuss the conditions under which these surface states can be probed experimentally, such as on metamaterial platforms. For instance, under open boundary conditions, the surface states are a mix of CLMs and skin modes induced by the NH skin effect, but the NH anomaly can be observed through transmission measurements under different magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Lifshitz theory for cavity-modification of ground-state energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory for ground-state modifications of matter embedded in a Fabry-Perot cavity and whose excitations are described as harmonic oscillators is presented. Based on Lifshitz's theory for vacuum energy and employing a Lorentz model for the material permittivity, a non-perturbative macroscopic QED model was built that accounts for the infinite number of cavity modes with a continuum of their wavevectors. Differences from the commonly used single-mode Hopfield Hamiltonian are revealed. The non-resonant role of polaritons in the ground-state energy shift is also demonstrated, showing that the cavity effect is mainly caused by static screening occurring at very low frequencies. The theory allows for a straightforward incorporation of losses and temperature effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetometers based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as the most important solid-state quantum sensors. However, ensembles are limited in optical contrast to typically a few percent and high-sensitivity variants usually possess only a few $\mathrm{\mu}$T dynamic range. Here, we demonstrate a laser threshold magnetometry-based NV system that avoids these limitations. By integrating the NV centers into a laser cavity and showing magnetic-field-dependent shifts of the laser threshold, we observe 100\,\% contrast with strong output signals up to 50\,mW. The resulting system exhibits a dynamic range of $\pm$280\,$\mathrm{\mu}$T with a photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity of 670\,fT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, which we demonstrate to improve super-linearly with contrast. The ratio of these sensing-relevant parameters, that can be traded at the cost of each other, marks an improvement factor of 780 over typical fluorescence-based readout and vapor cell sensors. Such performance improvements open the door to new generations of sensors for applications including magnetoencephalography, magnetic navigation, and magnetic anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Efficient optical configurations for trapped-ion entangling gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity and parallel realization in scalable platforms of the two-qubit entangling gates fundamental to universal quantum computing constitutes one of the largest challenges in implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Integrated optical addressing of trapped-ion qubits offers routes to scaling the high-fidelity optical control demonstrated to date in small systems. Here we show that in addition to scaling, capabilities practically enabled by integrated optics can substantially alleviate laser powers required for both light-shift (LS) and Molmer-Sorensen (MS) geometric phase gates acting on long-lived ground-state qubit encodings in a broad range of ion species. In the proposed gate schemes utilizing carrier nulling via ion positioning at phase-stable standing-wave (SW) nodes, our calculations suggest that suppressed spontaneous photon scattering at the SW node allows for gate drives operating at smaller Raman detunings, resulting in approximately an order-of-magnitude reduction in power requirement (and significantly larger in certain parameter regimes) for gates of a given duration and scattering-limited fidelity as compared to conventional running wave (RW)-based approaches. The SW schemes have the additional benefit of simultaneously eliminating undesired coherent couplings that typically limit gate speeds. Our work quantifies power requirements for multiple ion species and enhancements to be expected from carrier-nulled configurations practically enabled by integrated delivery, and informs experiments and systems for realization of fast and power-efficient laser-based entangling gates in scalable platforms.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid optical neural networks (HONNs) offload some electronic computation to optical preprocessors to achieve low-power and fast training and inference phases in machine learning tasks. Our contribution to the development of HONNs is a spectral-methods paradigm for building synthetic training data for machine-learned models. Here, our synthetic training image data does not resemble the image test data. As a result, the neural network focuses on learning specific features parameterized by the synthetic training data. Within this paradigm, a dataset's singular value decomposition entropy indicates {\it learnability}, i.e., how rapidly a model converges. Subsequently, we train a neural network model to rapidly learn specific features for further downstream analyses.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of photonic spin Hall effect in Mie scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE), a hallmark of spin-orbit interaction of light, has long been considered a promising route toward spin-controlled functionalities in nanophotonics. Yet, its practical realization has been severely limited by the inherently weak spin-orbit coupling in typical systems, resulting in vanishingly small transverse shifts and extremely low scattering efficiency. This fundamental trade-off has rendered the PSHE observable only through complex weak measurement protocols and signal amplification-approaches that come at the cost of further intensity loss, particularly in nanoscale systems. In this work, we overcome this longstanding challenge by introducing a novel mechanism based on symmetry breaking and mode coupling in a standalone scatterer, which unlocks a regime of Friedrich-Wintgen superscattering with strong near-field spin-orbit interaction. This allows for simultaneous enhancement of both the photonic spin Hall shift and the far-field scattering intensity-boosting the latter by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to conventional dipolar particles. Through tailored multipolar interference, the PSHE is made accessible at experimentally convenient angles, enabling post selection-free detection. We report the first direct experimental observation of the PSHE from a single superscattering particle, achieved in the microwave regime via polarization-resolved far-field measurements. Our findings not only validate a new physical pathway for enhancing spin-dependent light-matter interactions, but also establish a robust, scalable platform for spin-based photonic technologies. This breakthrough opens new avenues in precision optical metrology, advanced imaging, LIDAR systems, and integrated photonic circuitry, bridging a critical gap between fundamental spin optics and real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise, yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks, enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise, representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in photon-limited applications.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneously integrated lithium tantalate-on-silicon nitride modulators for high-speed communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the prospects of higher bandwidths for optical interconnects, integrated modulators involving materials beyond those available in silicon manufacturing increasingly rely on the Pockels effect. For instance, wafer-scale bonding of lithium niobate films onto ultralow loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits provides heterogeneous integrated devices with low modulation voltages operating at higher speeds than silicon photonics. However, in spite of its excellent electro-optic modulation capabilities, lithium niobate suffers from drawbacks such as birefringence and long-term bias instability. Among other available electro-optic materials, lithium tantalate can overcome these shortcomings with its comparable electro-optic coefficient, significantly improved photostability, low birefringence, higher optical damage threshold, and enhanced DC bias stability. Here, we demonstrate wafer-scale heterogeneous integration of lithium tantalate films on low-loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. With this hybrid platform, we implement modulators that combine the ultralow optical loss ($\sim$ 14.2 dB/m), mature processing and wide transparency of silicon nitride waveguides with the ultrafast electro-optic response of thin-film lithium tantalate. The resulting devices achieve a 6 V half-wave voltage, and support modulation bandwidths of up to 100 GHz. We use single intensity modulators and in-phase/quadrature (IQ) modulators to transmit PAM4 and 16-QAM signals reaching up to 333 and 581 Gbit/second net data rates, respectively. Our results demonstrate that lithium tantalate is a viable approach to broadband photonics sustaining extended optical propagation, which can uniquely contribute to technologies such as RF photonics, interconnects, and analog signal processors.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-precision tracking of adipocyte dynamics via single lipid droplet whispering-gallery optical resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in spherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the deep penetration depth of ultrasonic imaging, showing great potential in cerebrovascular disease detection. However, the ultrasonic wave suffers strong attenuation and multi-scattering when it passes through the skull tissue, resulting in the distortion of the collected photoacoustic signal. In this paper, inspired by the principles of deep learning and non-line-of-sight imaging, we propose an image reconstruction framework named HDN (Hybrid Deep-learning and Non-line-of-sight), which consists of the signal extraction part and difference utilization part. The signal extraction part is used to correct the distorted signal and reconstruct an initial image. The difference utilization part is used to make further use of the signal difference between the distorted signal and corrected signal, reconstructing the residual image between the initial image and the target image. The test results on a photoacoustic digital brain simulation dataset show that compared with the traditional method (delay-and-sum) and deep-learning-based method (UNet), the HDN achieved superior performance in both signal correction and image reconstruction. Specifically for the structural similarity index, the HDN reached 0.661 in imaging results, compared to 0.157 for the delay-and-sum method and 0.305 for the deep-learning-based method.</description>

Abstract: Highly correlated biphoton states are powerful resources in quantum optics, both for fundamental tests of the theory and practical applications. In particular, high-dimensional spatial correlation has been used in several quantum information processing and sensing tasks, for instance, in ghost imaging experiments along with several quantum key distribution protocols. Here, we introduce a technique that exploits spatial correlations, whereby one can nonlocally access the result of an arbitrary unitary operator on an arbitrary input state without the need to perform any operation themselves. The method is experimentally validated on a set of spatially periodic unitary operations in one-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces. Our findings pave the way for efficiently distributing quantum simulations and computations in future instances of quantum networks where users with limited resources can nonlocally access the results of complex unitary transformations via a centrally located quantum processor.</description>

Abstract: The behavior of wave signals in the far zone is not only of theoretical interest but also of paramount practical importance in communications and other fields of applications of optical, electromagnetic or acoustic waves. Long time ago T. T. Wu introduced models of 'electromagnetic missiles' whose decay could be made arbitrarily slower than the usual inverse distance by an appropriate choice of the high frequency portion of the source spectrum. Very recent work by Plachenov and Kiselev introduced a finite-energy scalar wave solution, different from Wu's, decaying slower than inversely proportional with the distance. A physical explanation for the unusual asymptotic behavior of the latter will be given in this article. Furthermore, two additional examples of scalar wave pulses characterized by abnormal slow decay in the far zone will be given and their asymptotic behavior will be discussed. A proof of feasibility of acoustic and electromagnetic fields with the abnormal asymptotics will be described.</description>
