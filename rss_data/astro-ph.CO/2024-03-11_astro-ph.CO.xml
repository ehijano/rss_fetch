      <title>Concerning S$H_0$ES Data: Discrepant $W_{0,VI}$ Absolute Magnitudes for Cepheids in the Keystone Galaxy NGC4258</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S$H_0$ES $VI$-band photometry for classical Cepheids in the keystone galaxy NGC4258 yield discrepant absolute magnitudes. Specifically, the 2016 and 2022 published S$H_0$ES Cepheid data for NGC4258 exhibit a substantial offset of $\Delta W_{0,VI}\simeq0^{\rm m}.3$. That adds to a suite of existing concerns associated with the S$H_0$ES analysis, which in sum imply that their relatively non-changing Hubble constant for nearly twenty years should be viewed with caution.</description>

      <title>The 21-cm signal during the end stages of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the epoch of reionization (EoR), the 21-cm signal allows direct observation of the neutral hydrogen (\hi{}) in the intergalactic medium (IGM). In the post-reionization era, this signal instead probes \hi{} in galaxies, which traces the dark matter density distribution. With new numerical simulations, we investigated the end stages of reionization to elucidate the transition of our Universe into the post-reionization era. Our models are consistent with the latest high-redshift measurements, including ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions. Notably, these models consistently reproduced the evolution of the UV photon background, which is constrained from Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra. We studied the dependence of this background on the nature of photon sinks in the IGM, requiring mean free path of UV photons to be $\sim$10 comoving-megaparsecs (cMpc) during the EoR that increases gradually with time during late stages ($z\lesssim 6$). Our models revealed that the reionization of the IGM transitioned from an \textit{inside-out} to an \textit{outside-in} process when the Universe is less than 0.01 per cent neutral. During this epoch, the 21-cm signal also shifted from probing predominantly the \hi{} in the IGM to that in galaxies. Furthermore, we identified a statistically significant number of large neutral islands (with sizes up to 40 cMpc) persisting until very late stages ($5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$) that can imprint features in Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra and also produce a knee-like feature in the 21-cm power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dark Sector Preheating on CMB Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of curvature and tensor fluctuations is among the main features of cosmic inflation. The current measurements of the primordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide tight constraints on the amplitude of the scalar and tensor spectra, and the scalar tilt. However, the precise connection between these observables and a given inflationary model, depends on the expansion history between the end of inflation and the beginning of the radiation dominated era, which corresponds to the reheating epoch. This mapping between horizon exit and reentry of fluctuations, parametrized by the number of $e$-folds $N_*$, can therefore be affected by the presence of a transient epoch of non-perturbative particle production during reheating ({\em preheating}). Using a combination of perturbative and lattice computations, we quantify the impact of preheating in a non-equilibrated dark matter sector on the CMB observables, under the assumption of a simultaneous perturbative decay of the inflaton into Standard Model particles. Combined with structure formation constraints, this allows us to impose stringent bounds on the post-inflationary reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>Optical Photometric Indicators of Galaxy Cluster Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most dynamically relaxed clusters of galaxies play a special role in cosmological studies as well as astrophysical studies of the intracluster medium (ICM) and active galactic nucleus feedback. While high spatial resolution imaging of the morphology of the ICM has long been the gold standard for establishing a cluster's dynamical state, such data are not available from current or planned surveys, and thus require separate, pointed follow-up observations. With optical and/or near-IR photometric imaging, and red-sequence cluster finding results from those data, expected to be ubiquitously available for clusters discovered in upcoming optical and mm-wavelength surveys, it is worth asking how effectively photometric data alone can identify relaxed cluster candidates, before investing in, e.g., high-resolution X-ray observations. Here we assess the ability of several simple photometric measurements, based on the redMaPPer cluster finder run on Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, to reproduce X-ray classifications of dynamical state for an X-ray selected sample of massive clusters. We find that two simple metrics contrasting the Bright Central Galaxy (BCG) to other cluster members can identify a complete sample of relaxed clusters with a purity of ~40 per cent in our data set. Including minimal ICM information in the form of a center position increases the purity to ~60 per cent. However, all three metrics depend critically on correctly identifying the BCG, which is presently a challenge for optical red-sequence cluster finders.</description>

      <title>Improving the Cosmological Constraints by Inferring the Formation Channel of Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could be detected by space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), TianQin and Taiji. In general, locating EMRIs by space-borne GW detectors can help us select the candidate host galaxies which can be used to infer the cosmic expansion history. In this paper, we show that the localization information of EMRIs can also be used to select the candidate host AGNs which can be used to infer the formation channel of the EMRIs and extract more precisely the redshift probability distributions of the EMRIs. Using the EMRIs that are expected to be detected by TianQin and LISA and the galaxy catalog that can be provided by the Chinese Space Station Telescope for the analysis, we find that TianQin can constrain the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ to a precision of about $3\%-8\%$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ to about $10\%-40\%$, the network composed of TianQin and LISA can improve the precisions of $H_0$ and $w_0$ to about $0.4\% - 7\%$ and $4\%-20\%$, respectively, without considering the effects of AGNs. Furthermore, combining the detected EMRIs with AGN catalog by the statistical framework of likelihood-ratio-based, we find TianQin can establish the EMRI-AGN correlation with about $500$ EMRIs if all of the EMRIs indeed originate in AGNs, and the TianQin+LISA network can reduce this required number to about $30$. Once the EMRI-AGN correlation is confirmed, the combination of the EMRIs and AGN catalog can significantly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters. These results demonstrate the potentials of using EMRIs as well as galaxy and AGN catalogs to constrain the cosmological parameters and astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Using HI observations of low-mass galaxies to test ultra-light axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate recent and upcoming low-redshift neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys as a cosmological probe of small scale structure with a goal of determining the survey criteria necessary to test ultra-light axion (ULA) dark matter models. Standard cold dark matter (CDM) models predict a large population of low-mass galactic halos, whereas ULA models demonstrate significant suppression in this small-scale regime, with halo mass cutoffs of $10^{12}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{7}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ corresponding to ULA masses of $10^{-24}\,$eV to $10^{-20}\,$eV, respectively. We generate random, homogeneously populated mock universes with cosmological parameters adjusted to match CDM and ULA models. We simulate observations of these mock universes with hypothetical analogs of the mass-limited ALFALFA and WALLABY HI surveys and reconstruct the corresponding HI mass function (HIMF). We find that the ALFALFA HIMF can test for the presence of ULA DM with $m_{a}\lesssim 10^{-21.5}\,$eV, while WALLABY could reach the larger window $m_{a}\lesssim 10^{-20.9}\,$eV. These constraints are complementary to other probes of ULA dark matter, demonstrating the utility of local Universe HI surveys in testing dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Metastable Dark Energy Decaying into Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the proposal that an energy transfer from dark energy into dark matter can be described in field theory by a first order phase transition. We analyze the model proposed in Ref. Abdalla et al. (2013), using updated constraints on the decay time of a metastable dark energy from the work of Ref. Shafieloo et al. (2018). The results of our analysis show no prospects for potentially observable signals that could distinguish this scenario. We also show that such model would not drive a complete transition to a dark matter dominated phase even in a distant future. Nevertheless, the model is not excluded by the latest data and we confirm that the mass of the dark matter particle that would result from such a process corresponds to an axion-like particle, which is currently one of the best motivated dark matter candidates. We argue that extensions to this model, possibly with additional couplings, still deserve further attention as it could provide an interesting and viable description for an interacting dark sector scenario based in a single scalar field.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: impact of bandpass, polarization angle and calibration uncertainties on small-scale power spectrum analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects due to mismatches in passbands, polarization angles, and temperature and polarization calibrations in the context of the upcoming cosmic microwave background experiment Simons Observatory (SO). Using the SO multi-frequency likelihood, we estimate the bias and the degradation of constraining power in cosmological and astrophysical foreground parameters assuming different levels of knowledge of the instrumental effects. We find that incorrect but reasonable assumptions on the values of all the systematics examined here can have important effects in cosmological analyses, hence requiring marginalization approaches at likelihood level. When doing so, we find that the most relevant effect is due to bandpass shifts. When marginalizing over them, the posteriors of parameters describing astrophysical microwave foregrounds (such as radio point sources or dust) get degraded, while cosmological parameters constraints are not significantly affected. Marginalization over polarization angles with up to 0.25$^\circ$ uncertainty causes an irrelevant bias $\lesssim 0.05 \sigma$ in all parameters. Marginalization over calibration factors in polarization broadens the constraints on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_\mathrm{eff}$ by a factor 1.2, interpreted here as a proxy parameter for non standard model physics targeted by high-resolution CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>Bayesian mass mapping with weak lensing data using KARMMA -- validation with simulations and application to Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update the field-level inference code KARMMA to enable tomographic forward-modelling of shear maps. Our code assumes a lognormal prior on the convergence field, and properly accounts for the cross-covariance in the lensing signal across tomographic source bins. We use mock weak lensing data from N-body simulations to validate our mass-mapping forward model by comparing our posterior maps to the input convergence fields. We find that KARMMA produces more accurate reconstructions than traditional mass-mapping algorithms. More-over, the KARMMA posteriors reproduce all statistical properties of the input density field we tested -- one- and two-point functions, and the peak and void number counts -- with $\lesssim~10\%$ accuracy. Our posteriors exhibit a small bias that increases with decreasing source redshift, but these biases are small compared to the statistical uncertainties of current (DES) cosmic shear surveys. Finally, we apply KARMMA to Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES-Y3) weak lensing data, and verify that the two point shear correlation function $\xi_+$ is well fit by the correlation function of the reconstructed convergence field. This is a non-trivial test that traditional mass mapping algorithms fail. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Supranta/KaRMMa.git. KARMMA DES-Y3 mass maps are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/10672062.</description>

      <title>Absence of concordance in a simple self-interacting neutrino cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some cosmic microwave background (CMB) data allow a cosmological scenario in which the free streaming of neutrinos is delayed until close to matter-radiation equality. Interestingly, recent analyses have revealed that large-scale structure (LSS) data also align with this scenario, discarding the possibility of an accidental feature in the CMB sky and calling for further investigation into the free-streaming nature of neutrinos. By assuming a simple representation of self-interacting neutrinos, we investigate whether this nonstandard scenario can accommodate a consistent cosmology for both the CMB power spectra and the large-scale distribution of galaxies simultaneously. Employing three different approaches - a profile likelihood exploration, a nested sampling method, and a heuristic Metropolis-Hasting approximation - we exhaustively explore the parameter space and demonstrate that galaxy data exacerbates the challenge already posed by the Planck polarization data for this nonstandard scenario. We find that the most conservative value of the Bayes factor disfavors the interactions among neutrinos over a $\Lambda$CDM + $N_\mathrm{eff}$ + $\sum m_\nu$ model with odds of $23:1000$ and that the difficulty of simultaneously fitting the galaxy and CMB data relates to the so-called $S_8$ discrepancy. Our analysis not only emphasizes the need to consider a broader range of phenomenologies in the early Universe but also highlights significant numerical and theoretical challenges ahead in uncovering the exact nature of the feature observed in the data or, ultimately, confirming the standard chronological evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Violent starbursts and quiescence induced by FUV radiation feedback in metal-poor galaxies at high-redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim 8$ suggest that they are more luminous and clumpier than predicted by most models, prompting several proposals on the physics of star formation and feedback in the first galaxies. In this paper, we focus on the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in regulating star formation by performing a set of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of one galaxy at sub-pc resolution with different radiative feedback models. We find that the suppression of cooling by far UV (FUV) radiation (i.e., $\mathrm{H_2}$ dissociating radiation) from Pop II stars is the main physical process triggering the formation of compact and massive star clusters and is responsible for the bursty star formation observed in metal-poor galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$. Indeed, artificially suppressing FUV radiation leads to a less intense continuous mode of star formation distributed into numerous, but low-mass open star clusters. Due to the intense FUV field, low-metallicity clouds remain warm ($\sim 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$) until they reach a relatively high density ($\gtrsim 10^3\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), before becoming self-shielded and transitioning to a colder ($\sim 100\,\mathrm{K}$), partially molecular phase. As a result, star formation is delayed until the clouds accumulate enough mass to become gravitationally unstable. At this point, the clouds undergo rapid star formation converting gas into stars with high efficiency. We, therefore, observe exceptionally bright galaxies (ten times brighter than for continuous star formation) and subsequent quenched "dead" galaxies that did not form stars for tens of Myrs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new model of string inflation driven by a blow-up K\"ahler modulus of type IIb compactifications with a potential generated by string loops. Slow-roll is naturally realized thanks to the fact that the blow-up mode is a leading-order flat direction lifted by string loops which are unavoidable and generate a plateau at large field values. We check that throughout the whole inflationary dynamics the effective field theory is under control. We perform a phenomenological analysis determining the exact number of efoldings by studying the post-inflationary evolution. We determine the values of the microscopic parameters which lead to agreement with CMB data, together with the prediction of a tensor-to-scalar ratio of order $r\sim 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Information divergences to parametrize astrophysical uncertainties in dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical uncertainties in dark matter direct detection experiments are typically addressed by parametrizing the velocity distribution in terms of a few uncertain parameters that vary around some central values. Here we propose a method to optimize over all velocity distributions lying within a given distance measure from a central distribution. We discretize the dark matter velocity distribution as a superposition of streams, and use a variety of information divergences to parametrize its uncertainties. With this, we bracket the limits on the dark matter-nucleon and dark matter-electron scattering cross sections, when the true dark matter velocity distribution deviates from the commonly assumed Maxwell-Boltzmann form. The methodology pursued is general and could be applied to other physics scenarios where a given physical observable depends on a function that is uncertain.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black holes as dark matter using AMS-02 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the plausible candidates for the cosmological dark matter. Theoretically, PBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH}$ in the range of $4\times10^{14}\sim 10^{17}\,{\rm g}$ can emit sub-GeV electrons and positrons through Hawking radiation. Some of these particles could undergo diffusive reacceleration during their propagation in the Milky Way, resulting in acceleration up to the GeV level. This falls within the observation energy range of AMS-02. In this work, we utilize AMS-02 data to constrain the PBH abundance $f_{\rm PBH}$ employing the reacceleration mechanism. Our findings reveal that the limit is more stringent than those derived from Voyager 1 for nearly $\mathcal{O}(1)$ at $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ under the assumption of a monochromatic PBH mass distribution. The constraints are even more robust in a more realistic scenario involving a log-normal mass distribution of PBHs. Moreover, we explore the impact of varying propagation parameters and solar modulation potential within reasonable ranges, and find that such variations have minimal effects on the final results.</description>

      <title>A Goldstone Boson Equivalence for Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory of single-field inflation characterizes the inflationary epoch in terms of a pattern of symmetry breaking. An operator acquires a time-dependent vacuum expectation value, defining a preferred spatial slicing. In the absence of dynamical gravity, the fluctuations around the time-dependent background are described by the Goldstone boson associated with this symmetry breaking process. With gravity, the Goldstone is eaten by the metric, becoming the scalar metric fluctuation. In this paper, we will show that in general single-field inflation, the statistics of scalar metric fluctuations are given by the statistics of this Goldstone boson it decoupled from gravity up to corrections that are controlled as an expansion in slow-roll parameters. This even holds in the presence of additional parameters, like the speed of sound, that naively enhance the impact of the gravitational terms. In the process, we derive expressions for leading and sub-leading gravitational corrections to all-orders in the Goldstone boson.</description>

      <title>The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) Science White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is proposed as a new facility dedicated to the efficient delivery of spectroscopic surveys. This white paper summarises the initial concept as well as the corresponding science cases. WST will feature simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), a high multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and a giant 3x3 sq. arcmin integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability these requirements place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work synergistically with future ground and space-based facilities. This white paper shows that WST can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; origin of stars and planets; time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset will deliver unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The WST Science Team (already including more than 500 scientists worldwide) is open to the all astronomical community.

      <title>Mass varying dark matter and its cosmological signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nontrivial dark sector physics continues to be an interesting avenue in our quest to the nature of dark matter. In this paper, we study the cosmological signatures of mass-varying dark matter where its mass changes from zero to a nonzero value in the early Universe. We compute the changes in various observables, such as, the linear matter power spectrum and the cosmic microwave background anisotropy power spectrum. We explain the origin of the effects and point out a qualitative similarity between this model and a warm dark matter cosmology with no sudden mass transition. Finally, we do a simple analytical study to estimate the constraint on the parameters of this model from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data.</description>

      <title>The effect of pressure-anisotropy-driven kinetic instabilities on magnetic field amplification in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) is the low-density diffuse magnetized plasma in galaxy clusters, which reaches virial temperatures of up to 10^8 K. Under these conditions, the plasma is weakly collisional and therefore has an anisotropic pressure tensor with respect to the local direction of the magnetic field. This triggers very fast, Larmor-scale, pressure-anisotropy-driven kinetic instabilities that alter magnetic field amplification. We study magnetic field amplification through a turbulent small-scale dynamo, including the effects of the kinetic instabilities, during the evolution of a typical massive galaxy cluster. A specific aim of this work is to establish a redshift limit from which a dynamo has to start to amplify the magnetic field up to equipartition with the turbulent velocity field at redshift z=0. We implemented 1D radial profiles for various plasma quantities for merger trees generated with the Modified GALFORM algorithm. We assume that turbulence is driven by successive mergers of dark matter halos and construct effective models for the Reynolds number Re_eff dependence on the magnetic field in three different magnetization regimes, including the effects of kinetic instabilities. The magnetic field growth rate is calculated for the different Re_eff models. The model results in a higher magnetic field growth rate at higher redshift. For all scenarios considered, to reach equipartition at z=0, the amplification of the magnetic field has to start at redshift z_start=1.5 and above. The time to reach equipartition can be significantly shorter, in cases with systematically smaller turbulent forcing scales, and for the highest Re_eff models. Merger trees are useful tools for studying the evolution of magnetic fields in weakly collisional plasmas. They could also be used to constrain the different stages of the dynamo that could be observed by future radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Inferring the dark matter splashback radius from cluster gas and observable profiles in the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The splashback radius, coinciding with the minimum in the dark matter radial density gradient, is thought to be a universal definition of the edge of a dark matter halo. Observational methods to detect it have traced the dark matter using weak gravitational lensing or galaxy number counts. Recent attempts have also claimed the detection of a similar feature in Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations of the hot intracluster gas. Here, we use the FLAMINGO simulations to investigate whether an extremum gradient in a similar position to the splashback radius is predicted to occur in the cluster gas profiles. We find that the minimum in the gradient of the stacked 3D gas density and pressure profiles, and the maximum in the gradient of the entropy profile, broadly align with the splashback feature though there are significant differences. While the dark matter splashback radius varies with specific mass accretion rate, in agreement with previous work, the radial position of the deepest minimum in the log-slope of the gas density is more sensitive to halo mass. In addition, we show that a similar minimum is also present in projected 2D pseudo-observable profiles: emission measure (X-ray); Compton-$y$ (SZ) and surface mass density (weak lensing). We find that the latter traces the dark matter results reasonably well albeit the minimum occurs at a slightly smaller radius. While results for the gas profiles are largely insensitive to accretion rate and various observable proxies for dynamical state, they do depend on the strength of the feedback processes.</description>

      <title>Searching for scalar field dark matter with LIGO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a direct search for scalar field dark matter using data from LIGO's third observing run. We analyse the coupling of size oscillations of the interferometer's beamsplitter and arm test masses that may be caused by scalar field dark matter. Using new efficient search methods to maximise sensitivity for signatures of such oscillations, we set new upper limits for the coupling constants of scalar field dark matter as a function of its mass, which improve upon bounds from previous direct searches by several orders of magnitude in a frequency band from 10 Hz to 180 Hz.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Wave interpretation of PTA data: a complete study for general equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We thoroughly study the induced gravitational wave interpretation of the possible gravitational wave background reported by PTA collaborations, considering the unknown equation of state $w$ of the early universe. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the NANOGrav data using the publicly available \textsc{PTArcade} code together with \textsc{SIGWfast} for the numerical integration of the induced gravitational wave spectrum. We focus on two cases: a monochromatic and a log-normal primordial spectrum of fluctuations. For the log-normal spectrum, we show that, while the results are not very sensitive to $w$ when the GW peak is close to the PTA window, radiation domination is out of the $2\sigma$ contours when only the infra-red power-law tail contributes. For the monochromatic spectrum, the $2\sigma$ bounds yield $0.1\lesssim w\lesssim0.9$ so that radiation domination is close to the central value. We also investigate the primordial black hole (PBH) counterpart using the peak formalism. We show that, in general terms, a larger width and stiffer equation of state alleviates the overproduction of PBHs. No PBH overproduction requires $w\gtrsim0.42$ up to 2-$\sigma$ level for the monochromatic spectrum. Furthermore, including bounds from the cosmic microwave background, we find in general that the mass range of the PBH counterpart is bounded by $10^{-5} M_\odot\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim10^{-1} M_\odot$. Lastly, we find that the PTA signal can explain the microlensing events reported by OGLE for $0.42\lesssim w\lesssim 0.50$. Our work showcases a complete treatment of induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes for general $w$ for future data analysis.</description>

      <title>Dark Radiation from the Primordial Thermal Bath in Momentum Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the stunning projections for future CMB surveys, we evaluate the amount of dark radiation produced in the early Universe by two-body decays or binary scatterings with thermal bath particles via a rigorous analysis in momentum space. We track the evolution of the dark radiation phase space distribution, and we use the asymptotic solution to evaluate the amount of additional relativistic energy density parameterized in terms of an effective number of additional neutrino species $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Our approach allows for studying light particles that never reach equilibrium across cosmic history, and to scrutinize the physics of the decoupling when they thermalize instead. We incorporate quantum statistical effects for all the particles involved in the production processes, and we account for the energy exchanged between the visible and invisible sectors. Non-instantaneous decoupling is responsible for spectral distortions in the final distributions, and we quantify how they translate into the corresponding value for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Finally, we undertake a comprehensive comparison between our exact results and approximated methods commonly employed in the existing literature. Remarkably, we find that the difference can be larger than the experimental sensitivity of future observations, justifying the need for a rigorous analysis in momentum space.</description>

      <title>The feasibility of ultra-relativistic bubbles in SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A first order electroweak phase transition probes physics beyond the Standard Model on multiple frontiers and therefore is of immense interest for theoretical exploration. We conduct a model-independent study of the effects of relevant dimension 6 operators, of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, on electroweak phase transition. We use a thermally corrected and renormalization group improved potential and study its impact on nucleation temperature. We then outline bubble dynamics that lead to ultra-relativistic bubble wall velocities which are mainly motivated from the viewpoint of gravitational wave detection. We highlight the ranges of the Wilson coefficients that give rise to such bubble wall velocities and predict gravitational wave spectra generated by such transitions which can be tested in future experiments. The low new physics scale necessitates the inclusion of dimension 8 contributions. We also quantify their impact on ultra-relativistic bubble wall dynamics.</description>
