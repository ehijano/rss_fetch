      <title>Non-equilibrium Ion Transport in a Hybrid Battery Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid materials, which combine inorganic and molecular components, often exhibit structural flexibility that enables unusual functional responses. Among them, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are a promising class for post-lithium battery technologies. Here, we show that non-equilibrium transformation processes govern the charge-storage mechanism of a PBA electrode, K2Mn[Fe(CN)6]. Ostensibly, this behavior mirrors that observed in high-rate cycling of conventional cathodes such as LiFePO4, yet arises here for fundamentally different reasons -- namely, low elastic moduli and cooperative distortions inherent to the hybrid framework. Using \emph{operando} methods, we show that framework flexibility limits transport kinetics and promotes collective, metastable pathways. Our results highlight new directions for PBA cathode optimisation, but also suggest a broader relevance of non-equilibrium mechanisms for mass transport in hybrid materials beyond PBAs alone.</description>

      <title>Tuning Nonradiative Recombination via Cation Substitution in Inorganic Antiperovskite Nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inorganic antiperovskite nitrides have recently emerged as promising materials for photovoltaic applications, yet their nonradiative recombination dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here, we examine the influence of X-site cation substitution on the nonradiative electron-hole recombination in $\mathrm{X_{3}NSb}$ ($X = \mathrm{Ca}, \mathrm{Sr}, \mathrm{Ba}$). Ca- and Sr-based compounds adopt a cubic phase, whereas Ba stabilizes in a hexagonal structure, introducing pronounced symmetry-driven effects. Substituting Ca with Sr narrows the band gap, suppresses octahedral and band-edge fluctuations, reduces nonadiabatic (NA) coupling by $\sim 54\%$, and extends carrier lifetimes by a factor of $2.5$. In contrast, Ba substitution increases lattice distortion, widens the band gap, and enhances NA coupling beyond that of $\mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$, thereby accelerating recombination through stronger lattice fluctuations. The resulting band gap fluctuations in $\mathrm{Ba_{3}NSb}$ also shorten decoherence times, following the trend $\mathrm{Ba_{3}NSb} &lt; \mathrm{Ca_{3}NSb} &lt; \mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$. Our results demonstrate how the interplay between band gap, NA coupling, and decoherence time governs recombination lifetimes, with $\mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$ exhibiting the longest lifetime. These findings highlight the coupled influence of cation chemistry and crystal symmetry in tailoring carrier dynamics for high-performance antiperovskite-based optoelectronics materials.</description>

      <title>Mo Atom Rearrangement Drives Layer-Dependent Reactivity in Two-Dimensional MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a valuable platform for manipulating and studying chemical reactions at atomic level, owing to the ease of controlling their microscopic structure at the nanometer scale. While extensive research has been conducted on the structure-dependent chemical activity of 2D materials, the influence of structural transformation during the reaction remains largely unexplored. In this work, we report the layer-dependent chemical reactivity of MoS2 during a nitridation atomic substitution reaction and attribute it to the rearrangement of Mo atoms. Our results show that the chemical reactivity of MoS2 decreases as the number of layers is reduced in the few-layer regime. In particular, monolayer MoS2 exhibits significantly lower reactivity compared to its few-layer and multilayer counterparts. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that MoN nanonetworks form as reaction products from monolayer and bilayer MoS2, with the continuity of the MoN crystals increasing with layer number, consistent with the local conductivity mapping data. The layer-dependent reactivity is attributed to the relative stability of the hypothetically formed MoN phase which retain the number of Mo atomic layers present in the precursor. Specifically, the low chemical reactivity of monolayer MoS2 is attributed to the high energy cost associated with Mo atom diffusion and migration necessary to form multi-layer Mo lattices in the thermodynamically stable MoN phase. This study underscores the critical role of lattice rearrangement in governing chemical reactivity and highlights the potential of 2D materials as versatile platforms for advancing the understanding of materials chemistry at atomic scale.</description>

      <title>A generalized and adaptable tensor-contraction-based cluster expansion formalism for multicomponent solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT)-based simulations of materials have first-principles accuracy, but are very computationally expensive. For simulating various properties of multi-component alloys, the cluster expansion (CE) technique has served as the standard workaround to improve computational efficiency. However, the standard CE technique is difficult to extend to exotic and/or low-symmetry lattices, often implemented via iteration over particular cluster types, which must be enumerated per lattice structure. In this work, we introduce the tensor cluster expansion (TCE), implemented in the open-source code tce-lib, which maps correlation functions to mixed tensor contractions, eliminating the need to iterate over cluster types and additionally making the calculation of correlation functions well-suited for massively parallel architectures like GPUs. We show that local interaction energies are an immediate consequence of the TCE formalism, yielding nearly $\mathcal{O}(1)$ energy difference calculations. We then use this formalism to fit CE models for the TaW and CoNiCrFeMn systems, and use these models to respectively compute the enthalpy of mixing curve and Cowley short-range order parameters, showing excellent agreement with ground truth data.</description>

      <title>A Fully Discrete Element Approach for Modeling Vacuum Packed Particle Dampers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate Vacuum-Packed Particle (VPP) dampers -- granular-core dampers offering tunable damping performance -- as a more sustainable alternative to conventional systems such as magnetorheological fluid dampers. A comprehensive computational model of the entire VPP damper system is developed using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). A novel discrete-element model of the flexible foil, responsible for consistently transmitting the external pressure resulting from vacuum application, is introduced and implemented by extending the open-source Yade DEM framework. A prototype VPP damper is also designed and experimentally tested, enabling both model calibration and validation of the simulation results. The calibrated DEM model is subsequently employed in a parametric study to assess the influence of material, geometrical, and process parameters on damper performance. All code, along with the associated experimental and simulation datasets, is made available in an open-access repository.</description>

      <title>Surface reconstruction and orthogonal decoupling in SrAl4 and EuAl4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-induced symmetry breaking in quantum materials can stabilize exotic electronic phases distinct from those in the bulk, yet its momentum-space manifestations remain elusive due to domain-averaging effects. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we present a microscopic investigation of the electronic structures of SrAl4 and EuAl4, layered tetragonal intermetallic compounds that exhibit well-characterized incommensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) transitions. Below the CDW transition temperatures, we uncover linearly dispersing electronic states and pronounced unidirectional replica bands orthogonal to the bulk CDW wave vector, evidencing the emergence of an in-plane C4 symmetry-breaking electronic order that is not dictated by the bulk incommensurate CDW. STM measurements further reveal a 1 times 2 surface reconstruction with quasi-one-dimensional modulations and half-unit-cell steps, traced to ordered 50 percent Sr/Eu vacancies, which vanish irreversibly upon thermal cycling, indicating decoupled surface and bulk orders. These findings establish SrAl4 and EuAl4 as model platforms for exploring surface-confined nematicity and emergent low-dimensional phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of A Crystal Plasticity Flow Rule From Discrete Dislocation Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum-scale material deformation models, such as crystal plasticity, can significantly enhance their predictive accuracy by incorporating input from lower-scale (i.e., mesoscale) models. The procedure to generate and extract the relevant information is however typically complex and ad hoc, involving decision and intervention by domain experts, leading to long development times. In this study, we develop a principled approach for calibration of continuum-scale models using lower scale information by representing a crystal plasticity flow rule as a Gaussian process model. This representation allows for efficient parameter space exploration, guided by the uncertainty embedded in the model through a process known as Bayesian optimization. We demonstrate a semi-autonomous Bayesian optimization loop which instantiates discrete dislocation dynamics simulations whose initial conditions are automatically chosen to optimize the uncertainty of a model crystal plasticity flow rule. Our self-guided computational pipeline efficiently generated a dataset and corresponding model whose error, uncertainty, and physical feature sensitivities were validated with comparison to an independent dataset four times larger, demonstrating a valuable and efficient active learning implementation readily transferable to similar material systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of spin-wave nonreciprocity and group velocity in a low-wavenumber regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity of spin waves is essential for components such as magnetic isolators and circulators used in spin-wave-based computing. A ferromagnetic (FM) bilayer exhibits significant frequency nonreciprocity and has attracted attention in recent years. Prior research on bilayers has predominantly focused on the high-wavenumber regime, where spin waves display significant nonreciprocity and are accessible through Brillouin light scattering (BLS). However, the dynamics at low wavenumbers (k &lt; 5 rad/um), which enable rapid magnon propagation, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. We investigate spin-wave propagation in the bilayer using coplanar waveguides (CPWs) and demonstrate that increasing the bilayer thickness enhances nonreciprocity even at low wavenumbers, which leads to the high group velocity originating from the Damon-Eshbach (DE) mode. These findings establish design principles for high-speed, low-loss spin-wave-based information processing.</description>

      <title>Dislocation interaction with a tilt low angle grain boundary in bi-crystal SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For potentially wider applications of ceramics with dislocation-tuned mechanical and functional properties, it is pertinent to achieve dislocation engineering in polycrystalline ceramics. However, grain boundaries (GBs) in general are effective barriers for dislocation glide and often result in crack formation when plastic deformation in ceramics is attempted at room temperature. To develop strategies for crack suppression, it is critical to understand the fundamental processes for dislocation-GB interaction. For this purpose, we adopt here a model system of bi-crystal SrTiO3 with a 4{\deg} tilt GB, which consists of an array of edge dislocations. Room-temperature Brinell indentation was used to generate a plastic zone at the mesoscale without crack formation, allowing for direct assessment of GB-dislocation interaction in bulk samples. Together with dislocation etch pits imaging and transmission electron microscopy analysis, we observe dislocation pileup, storage, and transmission across the low-angle tilt GB. Our experimental observations reveal new insight into dislocation-GB interaction at room temperature at the mesoscale.</description>

      <title>Optical spectra of small silver clusters with the Bethe-Salpeter formalism: a Reassessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optical absorption spectra of small Ag_n (n=2,4,6,8) clusters using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism with a Hamiltonian built from GW quasiparticle energies. Calculations are based on an effective core potential including the 4sp shells in the valence. Non-self-consistent G0W0 calculations relying on input Kohn-Sham eigenstates generated with semilocal functionals lead to very poor BSE absorption spectra, confirming a previous observation. However, eigenvalue or quasiparticle self-consistent GW calculations dramatically improves the agreement with experiments and TD-DFT spectra obtained with range-separated hybrid functionals. The importance of the position of the 4d occupied band is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Assisted Weak Beam Identification in Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations control the mechanical behavior of crystalline materials, yet their quantitative characterization in bulk has remained elusive. Transmission Electron Microscopy provides atomic-scale resolution but is restricted to thin foils, limiting relevance to structural performance. Dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) has recently opened access to three-dimensional, non-destructive imaging of dislocations in macroscopic crystals. A critical bottleneck, however, is the reliable identification of weak- versus strong-beam conditions. Weak-beam imaging enhances dislocation contrast, while strong-beam conditions are dominated by multiple scattering and obscure interpretation. Current practice depends on manual classification by specialists, which is subjective, slow, and incompatible with the scale of modern experiments. Here, we introduce a deep learning framework that automates this task using a lightweight convolutional neural network trained on small, hand-labeled datasets. By enabling robust, rapid, and scalable identification of imaging conditions, this approach transforms DFXM into a high-throughput tool, unlocking statistically significant studies of dislocation dynamics in bulk materials.</description>

      <title>Tuning Magneto-Optical Zero-Reflection via Dual-Channel Hybrid Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-channel coupling in hybrid systems makes an attractive testbed not only because of the distinct advantages entailed in each constituent mode, but also the opportunity to leverage interference among the various excitation pathways. Here, via combined analytical calculation and experiment, we demonstrate that the phase of the magnetization precession at the interface of a coupled yttrium iron garnet(YIG)/permalloy(Py) bilayer is collectively controlled by the microwave photon field torque and the interlayer exchange torque, manifesting a coherent, dual-channel excitation scheme that effectively tunes the magneto-optic spectrum. The different torque contributions vary with frequency, external bias field, and types of interlayer coupling between YIG and Py, which further results in destructive or constructive interferences between the two excitation channels, and hence, selective suppression or amplification of the hybridized magnon modes.</description>

      <title>Energy dependent Chemical Interface Damping induced by 1-Decanethiol Self-Assembled Monolayer on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical interface damping (CID) effect increases the collision frequency of free electrons in metals by changes of the metal surface. We have now experimentally disentangled the two contributions to CID: induced roughness and direct charge transfer. The latter is an important area of research in photoelectrochemistry with potential applications in light-induced chemical reactions. We present a broadband investigation of the CID effect on Au(111) covered by a self-assembled monolayer of decanethiol. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements show a photon energy dependent increase of collision frequency. We observe a constant, photon energy independent contribution, which is attributed to induced roughness and a contribution that linearly increases with photon energy from about 1 eV upwards which we attribute to direct charge transfer. The onset of the charge transfer mechanism corresponds to occupied orbitals of thiols bound to the Au surface, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Gas Sensing Properties of Novel Indium Oxide Monolayer: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation into the gas sensing capabilities of a novel two-dimensional Indium Oxide (In2O3) monolayer, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Targeting both resistive-type and work function based detection mechanisms, we evaluate interactions with ten hazardous gases (NH3, NO, NO2, SO2, CS2, H2S, HCN, CCl2O, CH2O, CO) as well as ambient molecules (O2, CO2, H2O). The monolayer shows pronounced sensitivity towards NO and H2S, and work function modulation enables detection of NH3 and HCN. Mechanical strain further broadens detection capability, enhancing adsorption and selectivity. These results establish 2D In2O3 as a tunable platform for next-generation miniaturized gas sensors for environmental monitoring and safety applications.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen absorption in intermetallic compounds from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermetallic compounds such as {A$_{2}$B$_{7}$} alloys are promising candidates for mobile hydrogen storage applications due to their high and reversible hydrogen absorption capacity. We compute the absorption isotherm of {Nd$_{3}$MgNi$_{14}$} from first-principles using a multiscale modeling approach. Absorption sites are identified through a systematic geometrical analysis, and are characterized with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The absorption site properties are used in room-temperature Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations to predict hydrogen uptake as a function of pressure, leading to a full absorption isotherm in good agreement with experimental data. We show that both hybrid exchange-correlation functionals and zero-point energy corrections are necessary to obtain accurate absorption properties. The analysis of the fully hydrogenated structure with DFT shows considerable volume expansion, which stabilizes the structure at large hydrogen content.</description>

      <title>Vanadium-Engineered Co2NiSe4 Nanomaterial: Coupled Thermoelectric, Piezoelectric, and Electronic Optimization via DFT+U for Advanced Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize the creation of advanced multifunctional materials in energy storage and conversion technologies, the present research evaluates the structural, electronic, magnetic, thermodynamic, mechanical, thermoelectric, piezoelectric and optical properties of pristine and vanadium-doped Co2NiSe4 by first-principles density functional theory (DFT + U ). It addresses the use of vanadium substitution to tailor the material, its performance and the inclusion of diverse fields by changing its electronic structure and its bonding properties. It can be seen in the results that V doping improves electrical conductivity and magnetic ordering because of a higher density of states and a stronger spin polarization at the Fermi level. Thermodynamic calculations show enhanced entropy stabilization at high temperatures and, mechanical analysis suggests an enhanced elastic moduli that proves the enhanced structural integrity without affecting ductility. The thermoelectric properties have been greatly improved realize an optimal ZT of ~1.1 at 900 K with 5 at.% V doping owing to an ideal combination of Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and inhibited thermal conductivity. Also, optical analysis reveals that expanded absorption spectra, increased dielectric response, adjustable reflectivity and energy loss spectra, optical properties can be used in photonic, and other optoelectronic devices. Better piezoelectric coefficients due to its effectiveness when doped also appeal to the usefulness of its application in nanoscale electromechanical systems. The combination of these results makes V-doped Co2NiSe4, a versatile material platform of next-generation energy storage, thermoelectric generation, and novel multifunctional sensors.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Stability and Spectral Shifts: A DFT+U Study of Eu-Doped ZnWO$_4$ for Visible-Light Optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungstate-based oxides have attracted significant attention owing to their excellent structural stability, chemical robustness, and versatile optical properties, making them suitable for next-generation optoelectronic and phosphor applications. Among these, ZnWO$_4$ has emerged as a promising host matrix; however, the role of europium (Eu) substitution in modulating its optoelectronic behavior remains underexplored. In this work, we employ spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) within the GGA+U framework to investigate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of pristine ZnWO$_4$ and Eu-doped ZnWO4 systems. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms dynamical stability for both pristine and doped structures. Eu doping reduces the bandgap, introduces new localized states near the Fermi level, and significantly alters the density of states, thereby enhancing electronic transitions. The optical response reveals a broadened dielectric function, red-shifted absorption edge, and intensified extinction coefficient, consistent with the presence of Eu 4f states. Additionally, reflectivity and energy-loss spectra indicate improved photon-phonon coupling and optical tunability upon doping. These findings highlight that Eu incorporation not only stabilizes the ZnWO$_4$ lattice but also tailors its optoelectronic features, positioning Eu-doped ZnWO4 as a potential candidate for white-light-emitting diodes (w-LEDs) and related optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Strongly Entangled Kondo and Kagome Lattices and the Emergent Magnetic Ground State in Heavy-Fermion Kagome Metal YbV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we present compelling spectroscopic evidence demonstrating the intertwining and mutual interaction between the Kondo and kagome sublattices in heavy-fermion intermetallic compound YbV$_6$Sn$_6$. We reveal the Yb 4$f$-derived states near the Fermi level, along with the presence of bulk kagome bands and topological surface states. We unveil strong interactions between the 4$f$ and itinerant electrons, where the kagome bands hosting the Dirac fermions and van Hove singularities predominate. Such findings are well described using a $c$-$f$ hybridization model. On the other hand, our systematic characterization of magnetic properties demonstrates an unusually enhanced antiferromagnetic ordering, where the kagome-derived van Hove singularities near $E_F$ play a vital role in determining the unconventional nature of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction and Kondo coupling. These unique kagome-state-mediated exchange interactions have never been reported before and could lead to a novel phase diagram and various quantum critical behaviors in YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and its siblings. Our results not only expand the family of exotic quantum phases entangled with kagome structure to the strongly correlated regime, but also establish YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ as an unprecedented platform to explore unconventional many-body physics beyond the standard Kondo picture.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport in graphene under strain fields modeled by Dirac oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene has emerged as a paradigmatic material in condensed matter physics due to its exceptional electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties. A deep understanding of its thermoelectric transport behavior is crucial for the development of novel nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices. In this work, we investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of monolayer graphene subjected to randomly distributed localized strain fields, which locally induce impurity-like perturbations. These strain-induced impurities are modeled via 2D Dirac oscillators, capturing the coupling between pseudorelativistic charge carriers and localized distortions in the lattice. Employing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism, we compute the relaxation time using a scattering approach tailored to the Dirac oscillator potential. From this framework, we derive analytical expressions for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity. The temperature dependence of the scattering centers density is also investigated. Our results reveal how strain modulates transport coefficients, highlighting the interplay between mechanical deformations and thermoelectric performance in graphene. This study provides a theoretical foundation for strain engineering in thermoelectric graphene-based devices.</description>

      <title>$^{51}$V NMR evidence for interlayer-modulated charge order and a first-order low-temperature transition in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge order in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits a complex three-dimensional organization and intermediate-temperature anomalies whose bulk character has remained unsettled. We use orientation-dependent $^{51}$V NMR as a site-selective probe to determine the stacking of the charge density wave (CDW) state and its thermal evolution. Below $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}\!\approx\!94$~K, the field-linear splitting of the $^{51}$V central transition together with the anisotropy of the Knight-shift tensor identify an interlayer-modulated $3\mathbf{q}$ CDW whose local environments are consistent with a four-layer $2\times2\times4$ stacking with mixed trihexagonal/Star-of-David distortions, in agreement with synchrotron x-ray determinations. For comparison, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ serves as a reference exhibiting a uniform trihexagonal $2\times2\times2$ stacking, allowing us to isolate features unique to the $2\times2\times4$ state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. With $\mathbf{H}_0\!\parallel\!c$, the $^{51}$V quadrupolar satellites through the intermediate temperature scale near $T_{\mathrm{CO}}\!\approx\!65$ K reorganize into two well-resolved electric-field-gradient manifolds that coexist over a finite interval; their relative spectral weights interchange on cooling while the total integrated satellite intensity remains conserved and $\nu_Q$ within each manifold is nearly temperature independent. The coexistence without critical broadening, together with conserved intensity, provides bulk evidence consistent with a first-order charge-order transition near $T_{\mathrm{CO}}$. Our measurements do not resolve whether this lower-temperature transition corresponds to a distinct in-plane order or a reorganization of the $3\mathbf{q}$ state; rather, they delimit this window and provide bulk, site-resolved constraints that connect prior reported anomalies to a thermodynamic first-order transition.</description>

      <title>Glassy interphases reinforce elastomeric nanocomposites by enhancing percolation-driven volume expansion under strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nearly a century, introduction of nanoparticles to elastomers has yielded extraordinarily tough nanocomposites that are critical to technologies from actuators to tires. The mechanisms by which this reinforcement occurs have nevertheless remained a central open question in material science. One widely debated hypothesis posits that strong interactions between polymer and particles induce "glassy bridges" that cement particles into a cohesive percolating network that resists elongation. Here, molecular dynamics simulations show that glassy particle shells do not primarily provide elongational cohesion. Instead, they amplify an underlying mechanism wherein competition between filler and elastomer networks causes the elastomer's volume to increase on deformation. This induces contributions from the elastomer's bulk modulus, which is of order 1000 times larger than its Young's modulus. These findings establish a unified understanding of low-strain reinforcement in filled elastomers as emanating from volumetric competition between coexisting particulate and elastomeric networks. This reframes and unifies our understanding of low-strain reinforcement, provides a clear-cut diagnostic for the presence of glassy bridging, and offers a new design principle for tough elastomeric nanocomposites.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency interlayer phonon dynamics and photoinduced terahertz absorption in black phosphorus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong interlayer coupling in black phosphorus (BP), arising from wavefunction overlap between layers, is critical for understanding its electronic and optical properties. Here, we utilize terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to study phonon dynamics in BP. We identify two peaks at 6 and 8.5 meV in steady-state THz spectra, which are attributed to low-frequency interlayer phonon modes. Both modes exhibit anharmonic phonon coupling behavior below 150 K, manifesting as temperature-dependent red-shifts. Using time-resolved THz spectroscopy, we observe significantly increased THz absorption under photoexcitation, arising from the transient enhancements of the extended Drude component and the oscillator strengths of interlayer phonons in non-equilibrium. These findings highlight the critical role of interlayer phonon dynamics in understanding many-body physics in BP.</description>

      <title>Hot-Ham: an accurate and efficient E(3)-equivariant machine-learning electronic structures calculation framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinations of machine learning with ab initio methods have attracted much attention for their potential to resolve the accuracy-efficiency dilemma and facilitate calculations for large-scale systems. Recently, equivariant message passing neural networks (MPNNs) that explicitly incorporate symmetry constraints have demonstrated promise for interatomic potential and density functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian predictions. However, the high-order tensors used to represent node and edge information are coupled through the Clebsch-Gordan tensor product (CGTP), leading to steep increases in computational complexity and seriously hindering the performance of equivariant MPNNs. Here, we develop High-order Tensor machine-learning Hamiltonian (Hot-Ham), an E(3) equivariant MPNN framework that combines two advanced technologies local coordinate transformation and Gaunt tensor product (GTP) to efficiently model DFT Hamiltonians. These two innovations significantly reduce the complexity of tensor products from O(L^6) to O(L^3) or O(L^2 log^2 L) for the max tensor order L, and enhance the performance of MPNNs. Benchmarks on several public datasets demonstrate its state-of-the-art accuracy with relatively few parameters, and the applications to multilayer twisted moir\'e systems, heterostructures and allotropes showcase its generalization ability and high efficiency. Our Hot-Ham method provides a new perspective for developing efficient equivariant neural networks and would be a promising approach for investigating the electronic properties of large-scale materials systems.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Kagome and Heavy Fermion Flat Bands in YbCr$_6$Ge$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands, emergent in strongly correlated electron systems, stand at the frontier of condensed matter physics, providing fertile ground for unconventional quantum phases. Recent observations of dispersionless bands at the Fermi level in kagome lattice open the possibility of unifying the disjoint paradigms of topology and correlation-driven heavy fermion liquids. Here, we report the unprecedented coexistence of these mechanisms in the layered kagome metal YbCr6Ge6. At high temperatures, an intrinsic kagome flat band-arising from the frustrated hopping on the kagome lattice-dominates the Fermi level. Upon cooling, localized Yb 4f-states hybridize with the topological kagome flat bands, transforming this state into the Kondo resonance states that are nearly dispersionless across the entire Brillouin zone. Crystalline symmetry forbids hybridization along specific high-symmetry lines, which stabilizes Dirac crossings of heavy-fermion character. Topological analysis of the resulting gaps reveals both trivial and nontrivial Z2 invariants, establishing the emergence of a Dirac-Kondo semimetal phase. Taken together, these results identify YbCr6Ge6 as a prototype of a topological heavy-fermion system and a platform where geometric frustration, strong correlations, and topology converge, with broad implications for correlated quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: Alpha-tantalum on silicon is a promising platform for high-coherence superconducting quantum circuits. However, the growth mechanism of alpha-tantalum on silicon remains poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study on alpha-tantalum films growth on various substrate. The decisive role of a substrate material Debye temperature on phase selection mechanism in tantalum films growth is experimentally confirmed, contradicting the prior assumptions on substrate temperature influence. Crucially, we confirm that alpha-tantalum starts growing only after a 7-10 nm thick beta-tantalum underlayer. It results in ranging the critical temperature of {\alpha}-Ta films from 3.77 K to 4.39 K for the total thickness from 20 to 150 nm, respectively. Finally, we compared high-quality Al and Ta coplanar resonators on silicon, demonstrating compact tantalum resonators (4/10.5/4 um) with an internal quality factor exceeding 10 million at single-photon excitation powers.</description>

Abstract: Nickel/zinc (Ni/Zn) technology is a promising post-lithium battery type for stationary applications with respect to aspects such as safety, environmental compatibility and resource availability. Although this battery type has been known for a long time, the theoretical knowledge about the processes taking place in the battery is limited. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the general cycling behaviour and the underlying processes, but also specific phenomena intrinsic to zinc-based cells such as zinc shape change, we carry out simulations based on a thermodynamically consistent and volume-averaged continuum model. We use a Ni/Zn prototype cell as a reference framework to provide a basis for modelling, parameter estimation and systematic comparison between simulated and experimental cell behaviour to improve cyclability and performance.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Formalism and Analytical Optimization Criterion for Multiscale Geometric Design of Thermoelectric Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) generators can directly convert heat into electricity, but their performance is often constrained by limited temperature gradients. Here it is shown that width-modulated metamaterials with constrictions and expansions (constricted geometries) enhance temperature difference DT by reduced Transmissivity (Tr), a geometry-based parameter defined by the ratio of constriction to expansion cross-sections. A universal scaling behavior of transport and key TE efficiency metrics with Transmissivity is demonstrated, spanning from the nanoscale to the macroscale. Analytical formalism validated through finite element calculations for a range of modulation geometries reveals that DT, electrical and thermal resistances, efficiency, and power output are governed by a single scaling function, g(Tr), independent of carrier type, material, or operating conditions. This function represents the conductance of a constricted geometry relative to a uniform-width counterpart. The developed framework yields TE Performance Design Maps and an analytical criterion for optimal TE performance, with the maximum power density achieved at an optimal Transmissivity Tr_opt, determined by the condition that the functional g(Tr_opt) equals the Biot number, the dimensionless ratio hL/k of the convection coefficient h, the structure length L and the material thermal conductivity k. Transmissivity is established as a robust, multiscale design parameter - analogous to nature's hierarchical structures for optimized functionality. This work provides the theoretical framework for multiscale design and optimization of constricted geometries, thereby enabling systematic exploration of design strategies for next-generation TE modules based on advanced thermoelectric metamaterials.</description>

Abstract: The comment (arXiv:2505.23490) fails to identify any scientific errors and its central arguments actually support the main conclusions of our publication [Nat. Phys. 21, 708 (2025)]. Firstly, the whole argument of the comment to try to explain our data explicitly relies on the existence of a large crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) effect. The presence of a sizable CAR transmission probability over a surprisingly long distance is the first conclusion of our publication. Secondly, the comment discusses the complex interplay of CAR and elastic co-tunneling, especially in the presence of local effects. This complex interplay is precisely the second conclusion of our publication. In essence, the comment amounts to merely pointing out that there is a broader sense in the notion of "dominant CAR" when nonlinear effects become relevant.</description>

      <title>Field-sensitive dislocation bound states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>

Abstract: When a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet is grown on a substrate, the interplay of momentum-dependent spin splittings arising from altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a nodal band structure with band degeneracies enforced by a $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. If we break the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry by an exchange field, the band degeneracies are found to be immediately lifted, leading to a topological band structure characterized by nontrivial strong and weak topological indices. Remarkably, both the strong topological index and the $Z_{2}$-valued weak topological indices depend sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. As a consequence of the bulk-defect correspondence, we find that the unique dependence of weak topological indices on the exchange field in this system dictates that the presence or absence of topological bound states at lattice dislocations also depends sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. When the substrate is an $s$-wave superconductor, we find that a similar dependence of band topology on the exchange field gives rise to field-sensitive dislocation Majorana zero modes. As topological dislocation bound states are easily detectable by scanning tunneling microscopy, our findings unveil a promising experimental diagnosis of altermagnetic materials among an ever growing list of candidates.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of topological 3Q state in intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnet Cox-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have opened a new avenue of opportunities encompassing various interesting phases. Co1/3TaS2-an intercalated metallic vdW antiferromagnet-is one of the latest additions to this growing list of materials due to its unique topologically nontrivial triple-Q (3Q) ground state. This 3Q tetrahedral structure, which critically depends on the Co content, yields the highest-density Skyrmion lattice with scalar spin chirality, resulting in a noticeable anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we demonstrate control of this topological phase via ionic gating. Using four CoxTaS2 devices with different Co compositions, we show that ionic gating can cover the entire 3Q topological phase and reveal the nature of the thermodynamically inaccessible phase space. Another striking finding in our data is the existence of an adiabatic discontinuity in the phase boundary between the 3Q and 1Q phases. Our work constitutes one of the first examples of electrical control of scalar spin chirality using an antiferromagnetic metal.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Rapid Crystal Structure Generation Towards a Target Local Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of material design, traditional crystal structure prediction approaches require extensive structural sampling through computationally expensive energy minimization methods using either force fields or quantum mechanical simulations. While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative models have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more rapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and periodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling structures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a symmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment Geometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these limitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on an augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning structure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known low-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the ground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy for the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as metal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials.</description>

      <title>Adjudicating Conduction Mechanisms in High Performance Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) cables, a contender for copper-wire replacement, is tied to its metallic and semi-conducting-like conductivity responses with temperature; the origin of the semi-conducting-like response however is an underappreciated incongruity in literature. With controlled aspect-ratio and doping-degree, over 61 unique cryogenic experiments including anisotropy and Hall measurements, CNT cable performance is explored at extreme temperatures (65 mK) and magnetic fields (60 T). A semi-conducting-like conductivity response with temperature becomes temperature-independent approaching absolute-zero, uniquely demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous fluctuation induced tunneling; complete de-doping leads to localized hopping, contrasting graphite's pure metallic-like response. High-field magneto-resistance (including +22% longitudinal magneto-resistance near room-temperature) is analyzed with hopping and classical two-band models, both similarly yielding a parameter useful for conductor development. Varying field-orientation angle uncovers two-and four-fold symmetries from Aharonov-Bohm-like corrections to curvature-induced bandgap. Tight-binding calculations using Green's Function formalism model large-scale, coherent transport in commensurate CNT bundles in magnetic field, revealing non-uniform transmission across bundle cross-sections with doping restoring uniformity; independent of doping, transport in bundle-junction-bundle systems are predominantly from CNTs adjacent to the other bundle. The final impact is predicting the ultimate conductivity of heterogeneous CNT cables using temperature and field-dependent transport, surpassing conductivity of traditional metals.</description>

      <title>Combining feature-based approaches with graph neural networks and symbolic regression for synergistic performance and interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based (MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.</description>

      <title>A foundation model for atomistic materials chemistry</title>

Abstract: Atomistic simulations of matter, especially those that leverage first-principles (ab initio) electronic structure theory, provide a microscopic view of the world, underpinning much of our understanding of chemistry and materials science. Over the last decade or so, machine-learned force fields have transformed atomistic modeling by enabling simulations of ab initio quality over unprecedented time and length scales. However, early ML force fields have largely been limited by: (i) the substantial computational and human effort of developing and validating potentials for each particular system of interest; and (ii) a general lack of transferability from one chemical system to the next. Here we show that it is possible to create a general-purpose atomistic ML model, trained on a public dataset of moderate size, that is capable of running stable molecular dynamics for a wide range of molecules and materials. We demonstrate the power of the MACE-MP-0 model - and its qualitative and at times quantitative accuracy - on a diverse set of problems in the physical sciences, including properties of solids, liquids, gases, chemical reactions, interfaces and even the dynamics of a small protein. The model can be applied out of the box as a starting or "foundation" model for any atomistic system of interest and, when desired, can be fine-tuned on just a handful of application-specific data points to reach ab initio accuracy. Establishing that a stable force-field model can cover almost all materials changes atomistic modeling in a fundamental way: experienced users get reliable results much faster, and beginners face a lower barrier to entry. Foundation models thus represent a step towards democratising the revolution in atomic-scale modeling that has been brought about by ML force fields.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in barium hydrides via incorporation of light elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Barium hydrides are of interest for their potential in both ionic conductivity and superconductivity. Recently, a superconducting hydride BaH$_{12}$ containing H$_2$ and H${_3}^{-1}$ molecular units was experimentally reported with a critical temperature $T_\text{c}$ of 20 K at 140 GPa [Nat Commun 12, 273 (2021)]. Herein, we combine ab initio methods with a rapid calculator of $T_\text{c}$ based on the networking value model to predict that the introduction of light elements, such as Be, can effectively expand the structure diversity and structure space of barium hydrides. Although molecular hydrogen units are still widely present in thermodynamically stable and metastable crystal structures, we find that a metastable phase of BeBaH$_8$ shows a high $T_\text{c}$ of 49 K at 100 GPa, which is only 38 meV/atom above the thermodynamic stability energy. This BeBaH$_8$ remains dynamically stable at 15 GPa. Furthermore, our study shows that increasing pressure can further elevate $T_\text{c}$ beyond 100 K by enhancing the electron-phonon coupling constant. Our study proposes a feasible method for broadening the structural landscape in the exploration of superconducting phases of barium hydrides.</description>

      <title>Search for thermodynamically stable ambient-pressure superconducting hydrides in GNoME database</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of hydrides thermodynamically stable at 0K. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of ($T_{\rm c}$). Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic hydrides with ($T_{\rm c}$) above 4.2~K and reach a maximum ($T_{\rm c}$) of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.</description>

      <title>Crystal Structure Prediction with a Geometric Permutation-Invariant Loss Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).</description>
