      <title>Remark on quasi Sasakian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit quasi-Sasakian geometry in dimension three and examine how these structures interact with the foliation generated by the Reeb vector field and its basic cohomology. Through a deformation-based approach, we show that a closed, orientable $3$-manifold admits a quasi-Sasakian structure precisely when it is either Sasakian or arises as a K\"ahler mapping torus. In particular, every quasi-Sasakian structure in this setting can be deformed into a Sasakian or a co-K\"ahler one. This result leads to a complete classification of quasi-Sasakian manifolds in dimension three and highlights the geometric and topological features that distinguish the two cases.</description>

      <title>New rigidity theorem of Einstein manifolds and curvature operator of the second kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Bochner techniques, we prove that a compact Einstein manifold of dimension $n \ge 4$ has constant curvature provided that the curvature operator of the second kind satisfies a cone condition that is strictly weaker than nonnegativity. Furthermore, employing a result of Li \cite{Li5}, we establish that any closed Einstein manifold of dimension $n \ge 4$ satisfying
  \[k^{-1}({\lambda }_1+\cdots +{\lambda }_k)\ge -\theta(n,k) \bar{\lambda },\quad \text{for some} \quad k \le [\frac{n+2}{4}]\]
  must be either flat or a spherical space form. Here, ${\lambda }_1\le {\lambda }_2\le \cdots \le {\lambda }_{\frac{(n-1)(n+2)}{2}}$ are the eigenvalues of $\mathring{R}\,$, $\bar{\lambda }$ is their average, and $\theta (n,k)$ is a positive constant. This result generalizes the work of Dai-Fu \cite{DF} and Chen-Wang \cite{CW1,CW}.</description>

      <title>Variance-Refined In-Diameter Lower Bound for the First Dirichlet Eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with nonempty boundary and $n\geq 2$. Assume that ${\mathrm{Ric}(M)\ge (n-1)K}$ for some ${K&gt;0}$ and that $\partial M$ has nonnegative mean curvature with respect to the outward unit normal. Denote by $\lambda$ the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian. Ling's gradient-comparison method (Ling, 2006) provides an explicit lower bound for $\lambda$ in terms of $K$ and the in-diameter $\tilde d$ (twice the maximal distance from a point of $M$ to $\partial M$). We isolate the only step in Ling's argument that loses quantitative information: a Jensen-H\"older averaging that replaces a nonconstant one-dimensional comparison function by its mean. Using the uniform strong convexity of $x\to x^{-1/2}$ on $(0,1]$, we refine this averaging by a variance term and thereby retain part of the discarded oscillation. This yields an explicit closed-form in-diameter bound that is strictly stronger than Ling's estimate for every $K&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Explicit analytic functions defining the images of wave-front singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give explicit real-analytic functions whose zero sets characterize the images of the standard maps of wave-front singularities. Such functions are realizations of the main-analytic sets in the sense of Ishikawa-Koike-Shiota (1984). More concretely, a subset of Euclidean space is called a global main-analytic set if it can be described, up to a set of smaller Hausdorff dimension, as part of the zero set of a single real-analytic function, referred to as its main-analytic function.
  In this paper, we propose a general framework for constructing main-analytic functions by a method based on explicit resultant computations. In particular, we provide explicit formulas for the main-analytic functions associated with the standard maps of wave-front singularities of types A, D and E.</description>

      <title>Divergence and Deformed Exponential Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kullback--Leibler divergence together with exponential families establishes the foundation of information geometry and is widely generalized. Among the generalization, we focus on the $(h,\tau)$-divergence and $(h,\tau)$-exponential families. We present a sufficient condition for the $(h,\tau)$-divergence to induce a Hessian structure on an $(h,\tau)$-exponential family. We also define the $(h,\tau)$-dependence of random variables and prove a kind of the law of large numbers.</description>

      <title>Explicit elliptic estimates for nowhere vanishing harmonic 1-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute an explicit constant for an injectivity estimate on the 3-Torus involving the Laplace Operator. First, we provide motivation for such explicit estimates. We perform the computation for the 3-Torus endowed with the flat metric before generalising to perturbed metrics. Finally, we apply these results to show existence of a nowhere vanishing harmonic 1-form on the 3-Torus endowed with a perturbed metric.</description>

      <title>Fano Fibrations and Twisted K\"ahler-Einstein Metrics I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first of two papers studying both the geometric structure of Fano fibrations and the application to K\"ahler-Ricci flows developing a singularity in finite time. Given a Fano fibration which is generated by Kawamata's theorem from a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ endowed with an ample, rational line bundle $L$ and non-nef canonical line bundle $K_X$, we construct a $(1,1)$-form on the regular part of the base analytic variety which is related to the Weil-Petersson metric. It is also proven that the singular K\"ahler metric constructed by Zhang, Zhang, on the base analytic variety satisfies a twisted K\"ahler-Einstein equation involving this $(1,1)$-form and, for a submersion, that the Chern classes of $X$ and the base manifold decompose in terms of this $(1,1)$-form.</description>

      <title>Fano Fibrations and Twisted K\"ahler-Einstein Metrics II: The K\"ahler-Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second of two papers studying both the geometric structure of Fano fibrations and the application to K\"ahler-Ricci flows developing a singularity in finite time. We assume that the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on a compact K\"ahler manifold has a rational initial metric and develops a singularity in finite time such that the manifold admits a Fano fibration structure. Moreover, it is assumed that the volume form of the flow collapses uniformly at the rate of $C^{-1}(T-t)^{n-m} \Omega \leq \omega(t)^n\leq C(T-t)^{n-m}\Omega$. Under this setting, a diameter bound is obtained in any compact set away from singular fibres and the diameter of the fibres is proven to collapse at the optimal rate $\sqrt{T-t}$. Furthermore, several precise $C^0$-estimates are proven for the potential of the complex Monge-Ampere flow which involve the potentials of singular twisted K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on the base variety from part I. Finally, in the case of K\"ahler-Einstein Fano fibres, we deduce Type I scalar curvature in any compact set away from singular fibres and globally for a submersion.</description>

      <title>Topology of non-collapsed three-dimensional RCD spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that non-collapsed $\text{RCD}(K,3)$ spaces without boundary are orbifolds whose topological singularities are locally finite and locally homeomorphic to cones over $\mathbb{RP}^2$, and that the topology of such spaces is stable under non-collapsed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. We study the notion of non-orientability on these spaces as a key part of our analysis and show that the property of non-orientability (on uniformly sized balls) is stable under non-collapsed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. Finally, we show that any non-orientable non-collapsed $\text{RCD}(K,3)$ space without boundary admits a ramified double cover which is itself an orientable non-collapsed $\text{RCD}(K,3)$ space without boundary, and that such ramified double cover is stable under non-collapsed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>Solutions with clustering concentration layers to the Ambrosetti-Prodi type problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following Ambrosetti-Prodi type problem \begin{equation}\label{e50} \left\{\begin{array}{ll} -div (A(x)\nabla u)=|u|^p-t\mathbf{\Psi}(x), &amp;\mbox{in $\Omega$,} \\ u=0, &amp; \mbox{on $\partial \Omega$}, \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, $t&gt;0$, $p&gt;3$ and $\mathbf{\Psi}$ is an eigenfunction corresponding to the first eigenvalue of the following operator \[\mathfrak{L}(u)=-div (A(x)\nabla u).\] Moreover, $A(x)=\{A_{ij}(x)\}_{2\times 2}$ is a symmetric positive defined matrix function. Let $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ be a closed curve and also a non-degenerate critical point of the functional \[\mathcal{K}(\Gamma)=\int_\Gamma \mathbf{\Psi}^{\frac{p+3}{2p}}dvol_{\mathfrak{g}},\] where $\mathfrak{g}(X,Y)=\langle A^*X,Y\rangle$ is a Riemannian metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $A^*$ is the adjoint matrix for $A$. We prove that there exists a sequence of $t=t_l\to +\infty$ such that this problem has solutions $u_{t_l}$ with clustering concentration layers directed along $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Classification and stability of black hole event horizon births: a contact geometry approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical result by Penrose establishes that null geodesics generating a black hole event horizon can only intersect at their entrance to the horizon in ``crossover'' points. This points together with limit points of this set, namely caustics, form the so-called "crease set". Light rays enter into the horizon through the crease set, characterizing the latter as the birth of the horizon. A natural question in this context refers to the classification and stability of the structural possibilities of black hole crease sets. In this work we revisit the strategy adopted by Gadioux &amp; Reall for such a classification in the setting of singularity theory in contact geometry. Specifically, in such contact geometry setting, the event horizon is identified as a component (not connected to null infinity) of a so-called ``BigFront''. The characterization of BigFronts as Legendrian projections of Legendrian submanifolds permits to classify the crease sets and ``cuspidal sets'' (or caustics in Penrose's terminology) by applying classical results established by V.I. Arnol'd. Here we refine the stability discussion presented by Gadioux &amp; Reall of that connected component of the crease set that is not causally connected to null infinity and that constitutes the event horizon birth. In addition, we identify the existence of other components of the crease set that lie in the part of the BigFront that is causally connected to null infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Lax pairs for the recently (2023) introduced integrable PDE systems known as the BKM equations. As many known and previously studied integrable systems are special cases of the BKM systems, our construction provides Lax pairs for many integrable hierarchies, including previously studied ones such as Camassa-Holm, Dullin-Gottwald-Holm, cKdV, Ito, and Marvan-Pavlov, as well as new ones. The corresponding pair is related to a Sturm-Liouville operator on the real line whose potential depends rationally on the spectral parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15528v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore complex Riemannian geometry and Hermitian metrics on complex algebraic varieties and analytic spaces, respectively. In particular, we introduce Hermitian metrics on holomorphic Lie algebroids and examine the associated characteristic foliation with its canonically induced inner product. Furthermore, we study hypercohomologies related to the leaf space, leaves, and certain invariant subspaces arising from the characteristic foliation of a holomorphic Lie algebroid over a Hermitian manifold. Finally, we extends the concept of equivariant de Rham cohomology to the setting of Hermitian Lie algebroids.</description>

      <title>Conjugate points on Lie groups with left-invariant metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sufficient conditions for the existence of conjugate points along geodesics of a left-invariant metric on a Lie group, using a reformulation of the index form in terms of the adjoint action. In the compact semisimple case, with an arbitrary left-invariant metric, we show that all geodesics must have a conjugate point, and we give upper and lower bounds on conjugate times. In particular this applies to the left-invariant metrics on $SU(n)$ and $SO(n)$ which are of importance in fluid dynamics and rigid body motion, and yields estimates for the diameter and injectivity radius. We also establish criteria in the noncompact case: we show that every closed nonhomogeneous geodesic has a conjugate point, and determine explicit conditions for them in the three-dimensional unimodular case. For homogeneous geodesics, we relate conjugate points to Lagrangian stability, and Eulerian stability of the corresponding steady velocity. Finally, we obtain as by-products criteria for conjugate points in general homogeneous spaces, by lifting the problem to the total Lie group of the quotient and using a result of O'Neill. Through several examples, we show that our theorems apply when well-known criteria relying on positive Ricci curvature or other curvature bounds fail, and in some cases even when Ricci curvature is negative in all directions.</description>

In this paper we prove a characterization of $W$-congruences that allow us to study their umbilical points. We describe examples of isolated stable umbilical points of type $A_m$, $m\in\{1,2,3,4\}$, and discuss some partial results concerning the generalization of these results to any $m\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$.</description>

Abstract: This is the first of two articles in which we investigate the geometry of free boundary and capillary minimal surfaces in balls $B_R\subset\mathbb{S}^3$. In this article, we extend our previous half-space intersection properties to warped products, and extend (non-)umbilicity of discs and annuli to capillary minimal surfaces in high codimension. We establish a dual operation relating free boundary and capillary minimal surfaces. These results are discussed in a continuous, unified framework, particularly in relation to uniqueness of minimal annuli.</description>

      <title>OGRe: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Mathematica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present OGRe, a modern Mathematica package for tensor calculus, designed to be both powerful and user-friendly. The package can be used in a variety of contexts where tensor calculations are needed, in both mathematics and physics, but it is especially suitable for general relativity. By implementing an object-oriented design paradigm, OGRe allows calculating arbitrarily complicated tensor formulas easily, and automatically transforms between index configurations and coordinate systems behind the scenes as needed, eliminating user errors by making it impossible for the user to combine tensors in inconsistent ways. Other features include displaying tensors in various forms, automatic calculation of curvature tensors and geodesic equations, easy importing and exporting of tensors between sessions, optimized algorithms and parallelization for improved performance, and more.</description>

      <title>OGRePy: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: OGRePy is a modern, open-source Python package designed to perform symbolic tensor calculations, with a particular focus on applications in general relativity. Built on an object-oriented architecture, OGRePy encapsulates tensors, metrics, and coordinate systems as self-contained objects, automatically handling raising and lowering of indices, coordinate transformations, contractions, partial or covariant derivatives, and all tensor operations. By leveraging the capabilities of SymPy and Jupyter Notebook, OGRePy provides a robust, user-friendly environment that facilitates both research and teaching in general relativity and differential geometry. This Python package reproduces the functionality of the popular Mathematica package OGRe, while greatly improving upon it by making use of Python's native object-oriented syntax. In this paper, we describe OGRePy's design and implementation, and discuss its potential for reuse across research and education in mathematics and physics.</description>

      <title>On material-uniform elastic bodies with disclinations and their homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we define material-uniform hyperelastic bodies (in the sense of Noll) containing discrete disclinations and dislocations, and study their properties. We show in a rigorous way that the size of a disclination is limited by the symmetries of the constitutive relation; in particular, if the symmetry group of the body is discrete, it cannot admit arbitrarily small, yet non-zero, disclinations. We then discuss the application of these observations to the derivations of models of bodies with continuously-distributed defects.</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of double fibration transforms with conjugate points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of normal operators of double fibration transforms with conjugate points. Examples of double fibration transforms include Radon transforms, $d$-plane transforms on the Euclidean space, geodesic X-ray transforms, light-ray transforms, and ray transforms defined by null bicharacteristics associated with real principal type operators. We show that, under certain stable conditions on the distribution of conjugate points, the normal operator splits into an elliptic pseudodifferential operator and several Fourier integral operators, depending on the degree of the conjugate points. These problems were first studied for geodesic X-ray transforms by Stefanov and Uhlmann (Analysis \&amp; PDE, {\bf 5} (2012), pp.219--260). After that Holman and Uhlmann (Journal of Differential Geometry, {\bf 108} (2018), pp.459--494) proved refined results according to the degree of regular conjugate points.</description>

      <title>Jacobi's solution for geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On Boxing Day, 1838, Jacobi found a solution to the problem of geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid, with the course of the geodesic and the distance along it given in terms of one-dimensional integrals. Here, a numerical implementation of this solution is described. This entails accurately evaluating the integrals and solving the resulting coupled system of equations. The inverse problem, finding the shortest path between two points on the ellipsoid, can then be solved using a similar method as for biaxial ellipsoids.</description>
