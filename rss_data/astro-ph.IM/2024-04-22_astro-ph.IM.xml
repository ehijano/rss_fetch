      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scales of the energy spectrum and the spectral ratio define two characteristic scales, which can be regarded as the integral scale and the dissipation scale of turbulence, respectively, so that the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the exponent of the energy spectrum is steeper than not only the Kolmogorov but also the Burgers exponent, suggesting that there may be more complex mechanisms for energy transfer than Kolmogorov and Burgers turbulence.</description>

      <title>Asteroid (101955) Bennu in the Laboratory: Properties of the Sample Collected by OSIRIS-REx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 24 September 2023, the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission dropped a capsule to Earth containing approximately 120 g of pristine carbonaceous regolith from Bennu. We describe the delivery and initial allocation of this asteroid sample and introduce its bulk physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties from early analyses. The regolith is very dark overall, with higher-reflectance inclusions and particles interspersed. Particle sizes range from sub-micron dust to a stone about 3.5 cm long. Millimeter-scale and larger stones typically have hummocky or angular morphologies. A subset of the stones appears mottled by brighter material that occurs as veins and crusts. Hummocky stones have the lowest densities and mottled stones have the highest. Remote sensing of the surface of Bennu detected hydrated phyllosilicates, magnetite, organic compounds, carbonates, and scarce anhydrous silicates, all of which the sample confirms. We also find sulfides, presolar grains, and, less expectedly, Na-rich phosphates, as well as other trace phases. The sample composition and mineralogy indicate substantial aqueous alteration and resemble those of Ryugu and the most chemically primitive, low-petrologic-type carbonaceous chondrites. Nevertheless, we find distinct hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopic compositions, and some of the material we analyzed is enriched in fluid-mobile elements. Our findings underscore the value of sample return, especially for low-density material that may not readily survive atmospheric entry, and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive analyses.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties of Type II Supernovae Inferred from ZTF and ATLAS Photometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an analysis of a sample of 186 spectroscopically confirmed Type II supernova (SN) light curves (LCs) obtained from a combination of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) observations. We implement a method to infer physical parameters from these LCs using hydrodynamic models that take into account the progenitor mass, the explosion energy, and the presence of circumstellar matter (CSM). The CSM is modelled via the mass loss rate, wind acceleration at the surface of the progenitor star with a $\beta$ velocity law, and the CSM radius. We also infer the time of explosion, attenuation (A$_V$), and the redshift for each SN. Our results favor low-mass progenitor stars (M$_{ZAMS}$\,$&lt;$14\,$M_\odot$) with a dense CSM ($\dot{M}$ $&gt;$ 10$^{-3}$ [M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$], a CSM radius of $\sim$ 10$^{15}$ cm, and $\beta$ $&gt;$ 2). Additionally, we find that the redshift inferred from the supernova LCs is significantly more accurate than that inferred using the host galaxy photometric redshift, suggesting that this method could be used to infer more accurate host galaxy redshifts from large samples of SNe II in the LSST era. Lastly, we compare our results with similar works from the literature.</description>

      <title>The open-source sunbather code: modeling escaping planetary atmospheres and their transit spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape is thought to significantly influence the evolution of exoplanets, especially for sub-Jupiter planets on short orbital periods. Theoretical models predict that hydrodynamic escape could erode the atmospheres of such gaseous planets, leaving only a rocky core. Deriving atmospheric mass-loss rates from observations is necessary to check these predictions. One of the ways to obtain mass-loss rate estimates is to fit transit spectra of the 10830 {\AA} helium or UV metal lines with Parker wind models. We aim to provide the community with a tool that enables performing this type of analysis, and present sunbather, an open-source Python code to model escaping exoplanet atmospheres and their transit spectra. sunbather incorporates the Parker wind code p-winds and the photoionization code Cloudy, with the ability to calculate any currently known spectral tracer at an arbitrary atmospheric composition. With sunbather, we investigate how the atmospheric structure of a generic hot Neptune planet depends on the metallicity. We find that the mass-loss rate drops by roughly one order of magnitude as we increase the metallicity from solar to 50 times solar. Line cooling by metal species is important already for a solar composition, and more so at higher metallicity. We then demonstrate how sunbather can be used to interpret observations of spectral lines that form in the upper atmosphere. We fit the observed helium spectrum of the mini-Neptune TOI-2134 b and show how even for helium data, the inferred mass-loss rate depends on the metallicity by up to a factor of three.</description>

      <title>Enabling Unsupervised Discovery in Astronomical Images through Self-Supervised Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning, a branch of machine learning that can operate on unlabelled data, has proven to be a powerful tool for data exploration and discovery in astronomy. As large surveys and new telescopes drive a rapid increase in data size and richness, these techniques offer the promise of discovering new classes of objects and of efficient sorting of data into similar types. However, unsupervised learning techniques generally require feature extraction to derive simple but informative representations of images. In this paper, we explore the use of self-supervised deep learning as a method of automated representation learning. We apply the algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) to Galaxy Zoo DECaLS images to obtain a lower dimensional representation of each galaxy, known as features. We briefly validate these features using a small supervised classification problem. We then move on to apply an automated clustering algorithm, demonstrating that this fully unsupervised approach is able to successfully group together galaxies with similar morphology. The same features prove useful for anomaly detection, where we use the framework astronomaly to search for merger candidates. While the focus of this work is on optical images, we also explore the versatility of this technique by applying the exact same approach to a small radio galaxy dataset. This work aims to demonstrate that applying deep representation learning is key to unlocking the potential of unsupervised discovery in future datasets from telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Square Kilometre Array.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of exoplanets</title>

Abstract: Over the past 4 decades, the exploration of planets beyond our solar system has yielded the discovery of over 5600 exoplanets orbiting different stars. Continuous advancements in instrumentation and cutting-edge techniques empower astronomers to unveil and characterize new exoworlds with increasing frequency. Notably, direct imaging, also called high-contrast imaging (HCI), stands out as the only method capable of capturing photons emitted directly from the planetary bodies. This innovative technique proves particularly advantageous for scrutinizing nascent planetary systems, where planets shine brilliantly and emit significant heat during their initial developmental phases. HCI provides comprehensive visuals of the entire system, encompassing the central star, potential circumstellar disks, and any additional companions. However, the complexity of imaging an object 10^6 fainter than its parent star necessitates state-of-the-art instrumentation. HCI demands cutting-edge tools such as exAO systems, telescopes exceeding 8 meters in diameter, coronagraphs, and modern imagers. The pivotal role of post-processing cannot be overstated in the quest for detecting and characterizing planets through HCI. This method has not only facilitated the discovery of numerous planets but has also presented invaluable opportunities to explore the properties of young substellar companions, both planets and brown dwarfs. Insights into their interactions with parent disks or other companions within the system, the composition of their atmospheres, and the identification of still accreting planets, also known as "protoplanets," contribute significantly to our understanding of planet formation scenarios. The continued refinement of HCI promises to unveil further revelations in the captivating field of exoplanetary exploration.</description>
