      <title>Abelian integrals for polynomials with trivial global monodromy on $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider infinitesimal perturbations of Hamiltonian differential equations $dH + \varepsilon \omega =0$ on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}^2$, where $H$ is a polynomial of degree $m+1$ and $\omega$ is a non-exact polynomial 1-form of degree $n$. In order to study these perturbed differential equations, the associated Abelian integrals $I(c)=\int_{\gamma(c)} \omega$ are valuable tools. We assume that the polynomials $H$ are primitive with trivial global monodromy. For these polynomials, W. D. Neumann and P. Norbury provided a classification in three large families, up to algebraic equivalence. The knowledge of these families allows us to prove as first main result, that the respective Abelian integrals $I(c)$ are polynomial functions of the variable $c$, and to find sharp explicit upper bounds for the number of their zeros. The bounds depend on $m$, $n$ and the number of the generators of the fundamental group of the generic fibers of $H$. These upper bounds works for several new families of infinitesimal perturbations of Hamiltonian differential equations. Under trivial global monodromy, there exist canonical global generators $BC(H)= \{ \gamma_{\tt i}(c)\}$ of the fundamental groups for all the generic fibers of $H$, which are complex cycles of $dH=0$. As second main result; we compute the number of complex limit cycles of $dH+ \varepsilon\omega=0$ which originate from complex cycles in $BC(H)$. Several accurate examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Origami slope gaps and the Hall distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we review the theory of slope gap distributions of translation surfaces and summarize the state-of-the-art for calculating slope gap distributions of Veech surfaces. We then derive the slope gap distribution of a particular 10-tile origami by considering the origami's return times to a Poincar\'e section under the horocycle flow on the moduli space associated with the origami. We show that the resulting distribution is not a sum of scaled Hall distributions, unlike all previously published origami slope gap distributions. More generally, this demonstrates that the slope gap distribution of a branched covering of a translation surface cannot necessarily be represented as a sum of scaled copies of the slope gap distribution of the base surface.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Implosion in the Parameter Space of Cubic Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parabolic implosion describes the enrichment of Julia sets when a parabolic fixed point is perturbed. It is also natural to study parabolic implosion in parameter spaces. In particular, when one perturbs properly the family of cubic polynomials having a stable parabolic fixed point into nearby families, the enrichment of the bifurcation loci occurs. We investigate the topology of such enrichment in the parameter space of cubic polynomials and relate it to the corresponding enrichment of Julia sets of quadratic polynomials, the latter of which has been studied systematically by P. Lavaurs in the 80s.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary Markov Partitions and Multidimensional Continued Fraction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known from results of Sina\u{\i} and Bowen that a hyperbolic toral automorphism admits a Markov partition. Our aim is to generalize this concept to the nonstationary case, i.e., we associate Markov partitions to nonstationary sequences of toral automorphisms. Special emphasis is placed on sequences of toral automorphisms produced by strongly convergent multidimensional continued fraction algorithms. The convergence of the algorithms is expressed in terms of a Pisot type condition which yields hyperbolicity for the nonstationary dynamics. For a multidimensional continued fraction map, we first consider its natural extension, whose orbits are given by bi-infinite sequences of matrices with determinant $\pm 1$. The hyperbolicity property allows us to interpret almost every orbit of this natural extension as an Anosov mapping family, i.e., as a bi-infinite sequence of toral automorphisms with well-defined stable and unstable manifolds. We prove that this Anosov mapping family admits a bi-infinite sequence of explicit nonstationary Markov partitions. To obtain the atoms of the Markov partitions, a combinatorial structure, expressed in terms of substitutions and $\mathcal{S}$-adic dynamical systems, has to be superimposed on the Anosov mapping family. In particular, the atoms of the Markov partitions are geometric realizations of $\mathcal{S}$-adic dynamical systems, defined by suspensions of $\mathcal{S}$-adic Rauzy fractals. These Markov partitions then provide a symbolic model as a nonstationary edge shift for the Anosov mapping family. As a guiding example, allowing explicit realization results, we use Anosov mapping families on 2- and 3-dimensional tori associated to various versions of the Brun continued fraction algorithm.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Stability of Delay Differential Equations with Time-Varying Delays via Isospectral Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how time delays impact the stability of a delay differential equation is important for modeling many natural and technological systems that experience time delays. Here we introduce a new stability criterion for delay-independent stability of these equations, called intrinsic stability, showing global exponential stability for a large class of nonautonomous nonlinear systems. Our approach is able to incorporate bounded time-varying delays, including those with certain types of discontinuities. The approach we take to prove this result is novel, associating the delay differential equation with a sequence of finite-dimensional matrices of increasing size and using the graph-theoretic technique of isospectral reduction to analyze this sequence. We give an application of these results to the problem of determining consistency for delayed reservoir computers.</description>

      <title>Rescaled expansive measures for flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of rescaled expansive measures to study a measure-theoretic formulation of rescaled expansiveness for flows, particularly in the presence of singularities. Equivalent definitions are established via reparametrizations of different regularities. Under the assumption of positive entropy, we prove the existence of invariant rescaled expansive measures. In the appendix, we derive a rescaled version of the Brin-Katok local entropy formula for flows, extending [7] from nonsingular flows to general flows that may include singularities. This framework provides new tools for understanding entropy and expansiveness in continuous-time dynamical systems with singularities.</description>

      <title>Physical blowups via buffered time change in a mean-field neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Idealized networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with impulse-like interactions obey McKean-Vlasov diffusion equations in the mean-field limit. These equations are prone to blowups: for a strong enough interaction coupling, the mean-field rate of interaction diverges in finite time with a finite fraction of neurons spiking simultaneously, thereby marking a macroscopic synchronous event. Characterizing these blowup singularities analytically is the key to understanding the emergence and persistence of spiking synchrony in mean-field neural models. Such a treatment is possible via time change techniques for a Poissonian variation of the classically considered integrate-and-fire dynamics. However, just as for shock solutions for nonlinear conservation laws, there are several admissible blowup solutions to the corresponding McKean-Vlasov equations. Because of this ambiguity, it is unclear which notion of blowup solutions shall be adopted. Here, we unambiguously define physical blowup dynamics as solutions to a fixed-point problem bearing on the time change associated to the McKean-Vlasov equation. To justify the physicality of this formulation, we introduce a buffering mechanism that regularizes blowup dynamics, while satisfying the same conservation principles as the finite-dimensional particle-system dynamics. We then show that physical blowup dynamics are recovered from these regularized solutions in the limit of vanishing buffering. Our approach also shows that these physical solutions are unique, globally defined, and avoid the so-called eternal blowup phenomenon, as long as the neurons exhibit nonzero, distributed refractory periods, a reasonable modeling assumption.</description>

      <title>Singular functions obtained via random function iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a discrete-time dynamical system on the real line by random iteration of two functions. These functions are assumed to satisfy appropriate monotonicity conditions; optionally, a symmetry condition may be imposed. Using Bernoulli measures on the space of binary sequences we show that sequences generated by the iteration process almost surely diverge to either plus or minus infinity. The function that assigns to each initial point the probability that the iterates diverge to plus infinity is shown to satisfy a functional equation that encodes self-similarity properties. In this way we obtain singular functions that are well-known from the literature: Cantor-like functions, Lebesgue singular functions, and the Minkowski question mark function.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $2$-periodic $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $2$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n\geq 2$ and $d&gt;2$ is an integer. As before, we again study here counting problems that are inspired by the exciting advances on $2$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics and on $2$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any given prime $p\geq 3$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is bounded (if $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\setminus \{1,p\}$) or zero or unbounded (if $\ell \in \{1,p\}$) as $c$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic point-counting work of Benedetto, along with a conjecture of Hutz on $2$-periodic rational points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any given prime $p\geq 5$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c$ tends to infinity. Finally, we then also apply here density and number field-counting results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain again counting and statistical results on the irreducible monic integer polynomials and algebraic number fields arising naturally in our dynamical setting.</description>

      <title>Singularity, weighted uniform approximation, intersections and rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15607v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical argument was introduced by Khintchine in 1926 in order to exhibit the existence of totally irrational singular linear forms in two variables. This argument was subsequently revisited and extended by many authors. For instance, in 1959 Jarnik used it to show that for $n \geq 2$ and for any non-increasing positive $f$ there are totally irrational matrices $A \in M_{m,n}({\mathbb R})$ such that for all large enough $t$ there are $\mathbf{p} \in {\mathbb Z}^m, \mathbf{q} \in {\mathbb Z}^n \smallsetminus \{0\}$ with $$\|\mathbf{q}\| \leq t \ \text{ and } \ \|A \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}\| \leq f(t).$$ We denote the collection of such matrices by $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$. We adapt Khintchine's argument to show that the sets $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$, and their weighted analogues $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f, \mathbf{w})$, intersect many manifolds and fractals, and have strong intersection properties. For example, we show that:
  When $n \geq 2$, the set $\bigcap_{\mathbf{w}} \mathrm{UA}^*(f, \mathbf{w}) $, where the intersection is over all weights $\mathbf{w}$, is nonempty, and moreover intesects many manifolds and fractals;
  For $n \geq 2$, there are vectors in ${\mathbb R}^n$ which are simultaneously $k$-singular for every $k$, in the sense of Yu;
  when $n \geq 3$, $\mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) + \mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) = {\mathbb R}^n$.
  We also obtain new bounds on the rate of singularity which can be attained by column vectors in analytic submanifolds of dimension at least 2 in ${\mathbb R}^n$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of Newton polygons for compositions of polynomials over the rationals. We establish sufficient conditions under which the successive vertices of the Newton polygon of the composition $ g(f^n(x)) $ with respect to a prime $ p $ can be explicitly described in terms of the Newton polygon of the polynomial $ g(x) $. Our results provide deeper insights into how the Newton polygon of a polynomial evolves under iteration and composition, with applications to the study of dynamical irreducibility, eventual stability, non-monogenity of tower of number fields, etc.</description>

      <title>Quantitative contact Hamiltonian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic quantitative study of contact rigidity phenomena based on the contact Hamiltonian Floer theory established by Merry-Uljarevi\'c. Our quantitative approach applies to arbitrary admissible contact Hamiltonian functions on the contact boundary $M = \partial W$ of a ${\rm weakly}^{+}$-monotone symplectic manifold $W$. From a theoretical standpoint, we develop a comprehensive contact spectral invariant theory. As applications, the properties of these invariants enable us to establish several fundamental results: the contact big fiber theorem, sufficient conditions for orderability, and the existence results of translated points. Furthermore, we uncover a non-traditional filtration structure on contact Hamiltonian Floer groups, which we formalize through the introduction of a novel type of persistence modules, called gapped modules, that are only parametrized by a partially ordered set. Among the various properties of contact spectral invariants, we highlight that the triangle inequality is derived through an innovative analysis of a pair-of-pants construction in the contact-geometric framework.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity bounds in the Sliced Wasserstein distance for Schur stable autoregressive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit calculations in dimension one show for Schur stable autoregressive processes with standard Gaussian noise that the ergodic convergence in the Wasserstein-$2$ distance is essentially given by the sum of the mean, which decays exponentially, and the standard deviation, which decays with twice the speed. This paper starts by showing new upper and lower multivariate affine transport bounds for the Wasserstein-$r$ distance for $r$ greater and equal to $1$. These bounds allow to formulate a sufficient (non-Gaussian) affine-ergodic-interpolation condition for the mentioned mean-variance behavior to take place in case of more general Schur stable multivariate autoregressive processes. All ergodic estimates are non-asymptotic with completely explicit constants. The main applications are precise thermalization bounds for Schur stable $\textsf{AR}(p)$ and $\textsf{ARMA}(p,q)$ models in Wasserstein and Sliced Wasserstein distance. In the sequel we establish with the help of coupling techniques explicit upper and lower exponential bounds for more general multivariate Schur stable autoregressive processes. This includes parallel sampling and the convergence of the empiricial means.</description>
