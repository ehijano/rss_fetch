      <title>High Harmonic Generation from a Noble Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has typically been explored in transparent dielectrics and semiconductors. Metals have long been dismissed due to their strong reflectivity at infrared wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate HHG from silver - a noble metal - using few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses at near-normal incidence. Our results show that sub-cycle electron dynamics within the material's penetration depth can drive high-order harmonics, challenging the prevailing notion that metals are unsuited for infrared-driven strong-field processes. Despite silver's high reflectivity and large free-electron density, we observe nonperturbative harmonics extending into the extreme ultraviolet (up to 20 eV). Moreover, silver's multi-shot damage threshold proves surprisingly high (30 TW/cm^2) - comparable to large-bandgap dielectrics like magnesium oxide - thereby enabling intense strong-field processes in a metallic environment. Measuring the orientation dependence of the emitted harmonics reveals that the process arises from coherent electron dynamics in the crystal lattice, rather than from a plasma-driven mechanism. Time-dependent density-matrix simulations based on maximally localized Wannier functions show that low-order harmonics predominantly originate from conduction electrons near the Fermi surface (s- and p-type orbitals), whereas higher harmonics rely on bound d-electron excitations. These findings establish metals - long thought unfavorable for HHG - as a promising platform for ultrafast strong-field physics, extending high-harmonic spectroscopy to regimes in which lattice order and plasma formation directly intersect. This work expands the frontier of solid-state HHG to all-metallic attosecond pulse generation and underscores the potential of metals as robust XUV sources for advanced attosecond metrology.</description>

      <title>Optical pumping and initialization of a hole spin in site-controlled InGaAs pyramidal quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate site-controlled In$_{0.25}$Ga$_{0.75}$As quantum dots in (111)B GaAs pyramidal recesses as spin qubits. Combining scanning confocal cryomicroscopy, magneto-photoluminescence studies and resonant excitation, we identify and isolate a positively charged exciton with a hole-spin in its ground state. Application of a strong 5 T magnetic field parallel to the growth axis, induces a fourfold splitting of the energy levels of the positively charged exciton creating an optically addressable double-lambda system. We combine weak above-band and resonant excitation to demonstrate spin pumping and high-fidelity spin initialization through all four optical transitions and study the system behavior as a function of the resonant driving strength showing the existence of a robust spin that can be optically pumped and initialized. These results demonstrate the potential of these quantum dots for precise spin manipulation and their relevance for future quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Capture and release of quantum vortices using mechanical devices in low-temperature superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation coupled with the wave equation for a wire (GP-W) provides a natural theoretical framework for understanding recent experiments employing a nanowire to detect a single quantum vortex in superfluid $^4 {\rm He}$. We uncover the complete spatiotemporal evolution of such wire-based vortex detection via direct numerical simulations of the GP-W system. Furthermore, by computing the spatiotemporal spectrum, we obtain the vortex-capture-induced change in the oscillation frequency of the wire. We quantify this frequency shift by plotting the wire's oscillation frequency versus time and obtain results that closely match experimental observations. In addition, we provide analytical support for our numerical results by deriving the dispersion relation for the oscillating wire, with and without a trapped vortex. We show that the Magnus force opens a gap in the wire dispersion relation. The size of the gap becomes the characteristic frequency of the wire when a vortex is trapped.</description>
