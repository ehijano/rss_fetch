      <title>Using oxides to compute with heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most innovative possibilities offered by oxides is the use of heat currents for computational purposes. Towards this goal, phase-change oxides, including ferroelectrics, ferromagnets and related materials, could reproduce sources, logic units and memories used in current and future computing schemes.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithm Landscape Reconstruction by Low-Rank Tensor Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a broad class of algorithms with many applications in science and industry. Applying a VQA to a problem involves optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit by maximizing or minimizing a cost function. A particular challenge associated with VQAs is understanding the properties of associated cost functions. Having the landscapes of VQA cost functions can greatly assist in developing and testing new variational quantum algorithms, but they are extremely expensive to compute. Reconstructing the landscape of a VQA using existing techniques requires a large number of cost function evaluations, especially when the dimension or the resolution of the landscape is high. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank tensor-completion-based approach for local landscape reconstruction. By leveraging compact low-rank representations of tensors, our technique can overcome the curse of dimensionality and handle high-resolution landscapes. We demonstrate the power of landscapes in VQA development by showcasing practical applications of analyzing penalty terms for constrained optimization problems and examining the probability landscapes of certain basis states.</description>

      <title>Optimizing T and CNOT Gates in Quantum Ripple-Carry Adders and Comparators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The state of the art of quantum circuits using the ripple-carry strategy for the addition and comparison of two n-bit numbers is presented, as well as optimizations in the Clifford+T gate set, both in terms of CNOT-depth and T-depth, or CNOT-count and T-count. In particular, considering the adders presented by Cuccaro et al. and Takahashi et al., circuits with a T-depth of 4n and a CNOT-depth of 8n are obtained, while without optimization of the original circuits, a T-depth of 6n is expected. In addition, a new adder with optimized CNOT-count and T-count is introduced. Note that we have focused here on quantum ripple-carry adders using at most one ancilla, without any approximation of the 3-qubit gates involved (Toffoli, Peres and TR) or any strategy involving a measurement.</description>

      <title>A SAT Scalpel for Lattice Surgery: Representation and Synthesis of Subroutines for Surface-Code Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is necessary for large-scale quantum computing. A promising quantum error correcting code is the surface code. For this code, fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery, i.e., splitting and merging patches of code. Given the frequent use of certain lattice-surgery subroutines (LaS), it becomes crucial to optimize their design in order to minimize the overall spacetime volume of FTQC. In this study, we define the variables to represent LaS and the constraints on these variables. Leveraging this formulation, we develop a synthesizer for LaS, LaSsynth, that encodes a LaS construction problem into a SAT instance, subsequently querying SAT solvers for a solution. Starting from a baseline design, we can gradually invoke the solver with shrinking spacetime volume to derive more compact designs. Due to our foundational formulation and the use of SAT solvers, LaSsynth can exhaustively explore the design space, yielding optimal designs in volume. For example, it achieves 8% and 18% volume reduction respectively over two states-of-the-art human designs for the 15-to-1 T-factory, a bottleneck in FTQC.</description>
