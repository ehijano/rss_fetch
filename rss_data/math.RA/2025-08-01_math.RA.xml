      <title>On Dedekind Skew Braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skew braces play a central role in the theory of set-theoretic non-degenerate solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation, since their algebraic properties significantly affect the behaviour of the corresponding solutions (see for example [Ballester-Bolinches et al., Adv. Math. 455 (2024), 109880]). Recently, the study of nilpotency-like conditions for the solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation has drawn attention to skew braces of abelian type in which every substructure is an ideal (so-called, Dedekind skew braces); see for example [Ballester-Bolinches et al., Result Math. 80 (2025), Article Number 21].
  The aim of this paper is not only to show that the hypothesis the skew brace is of abelian type can be neglected in essentially all the known results in this context, but also to extend this theory to skew braces whose additive or multiplicative groups are locally cyclic (and more in general of finite rank).
  Our main results -- which are in fact much more general than stated here -- are as follows:
  (1) Every finite Dedekind skew brace is centrally nilpotent.
  (2) Every hypermultipermutational Dedekind skew brace with torsion-free additive group is trivial.
  (3) Characterization of a skew brace whose additive or multiplicative group is locally cyclic
  (4) If a set-theoretic non-degenerate solution of the Yang--Baxter equation has a Dedekind structure skew brace and fixes the diagonal elements, then such a solution must be the twist solution.</description>

      <title>Some Extensions of Endo-Noetherian Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we proceed on the transfer of the left endo-Noetherian property on certain ring extensions. We transfer of the right (left) endo-Noetherian property to the right (left) quotient rings. For a subring $T$ of $R$ and a finite set of indeterminates $X$, we prove that $T + XR[[X]]$ is left endo-Noetherian if and only if $R[[X]]$ is left endo-Noetherian. In addition, we prove that the subring $\Lambda :=\{ f \in R[[S,\omega ]]: f(1) \in T \}$ of the skew generalized power series ring $R[[S, \omega]]$ is left endo-Noetherian if and only if $R[[S, \omega]]$ is left endo-Noetherian. Also, we study the left endo-Noetherian property over the amalgamated duplication rings $R \bowtie I$ and $ R \bowtie ^f J$. Finally, we introduce additional results on left endo-Noetherian rings.</description>

      <title>Operator identities of multiplicity 3 for associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider algebraic identities for linear operators on associative algebras in which each term has degree 2 (the number of variables) and multiplicity 3 (the number of occurrences of the operator). We apply the methods of earlier work by the author and Elgendy which classified operator identities of degree 2, multiplicities 1 and 2. We begin with the general operator identity of multiplicity 3 which has 10 terms and indeterminate coefficients. We use the operadic concept of partial composition to generate all consequences of this identity in degree 3, multiplicity 4. The coefficient matrix of these consequences has size $105 \times 20$ and indeterminate entries. We compute the partial Smith form of this matrix and use Gr\"obner bases for determinantal ideals to discover which values of the indeterminates produce a matrix of submaximal rank. The only possible submaximal values of the rank are 16 and 19: there are 6 new identities of rank 16, and 8 new identities of rank 19.</description>

      <title>Pointed Hopf algebras, the Dixmier-Moeglin Equivalence and Noetherian group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the interactions between three properties that a group algebra or more generally a pointed Hopf algebra may possess: being noetherian, having finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, and satisfying the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence. First it is shown that the second and third of these properties are equivalent for group algebras $kG$ of polycyclic-by-finite groups, and are, in turn, equivalent to $G$ being nilpotent-by-finite. In characteristic 0, this enables us to extend this equivalence to certain cocommutative Hopf algebras.
  In the second and third parts of the paper finiteness conditions for group algebras are studied. In the second section we examine when a group algebra satisfies the Goldie conditions, while in the final section we discuss what can be said about a minimal counterexample to the conjecture that if $kG$ is noetherian then G is polycyclic-by-finite.</description>

      <title>On K\"{o}the's normality question for locally finite-dimensional central division algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14564v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers K\"{o}the's question of whether every associative locally finite-dimensional (abbr., LFD) central division algebra $R$ over a field $K$ is a normally locally finite (abbr., NLF) algebra over $K$, that is, whether every nonempty finite subset $Y$ of $R$ is contained in a finite-dimensional central $K$-subalgebra $\mathcal{R} _{Y}$ of $R$. It shows that the answer to the posed question is negative if $K$ is a purely transcendental extension of infinite transcendence degree over an algebraically closed field $k$. On the other hand, central division LFD-algebras over $K$ turn out to be NLF in the following special cases: (i) $K$ is a finitely-generated extension of a finite or a pseudo-algebraically closed perfect field $K _{0}$; (ii) $K$ is a higher-dimensional local field with last residue field equal to $K _{0}$.</description>

      <title>Radical preservation and the finitistic dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of radical preservation and prove that a radical-preserving homomorphism of left artinian rings of finite projective dimension with superfluous kernel reflects the finiteness of the little finitistic, big finitistic and global dimension. As an application, we prove that every bound quiver algebra with quasi-uniform Loewy length, a class of algebras introduced in this paper, has finite (big) finitistic dimension. The same result holds more generally in the context of semiprimary rings. Moreover, we construct an explicit family of such finite dimensional algebras where the finiteness of their big finitistic dimension does not follow from existing results in the literature.</description>
