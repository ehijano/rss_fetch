      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Release of A databaSe of millimeTeR ObservatioNs of Asteroids Using acT (ASTRONAUT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present A databaSe of millimeTeR ObservatioNs of Asteroids Using acT (ASTRONAUT) hosted on Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) in the form of a public Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. This bucket is an Amazon cloud storage database containing flux measurements for a group of asteroids at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. These measurements were collected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021 in frequency bands centered near 90, 150, and 220 GHz. The ASTRONAUT database contains observation times, normalized flux values, and associated error bars for 170 asteroids above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 for a single frequency band over the stacked co-added maps. We provide an example in generating light curves with this database. We also present a Jupyter notebook to serve as a reference guide when using the S3 bucket. The container and notebook are publicly available in a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Enriched volatiles and refractories but deficient titanium on the dayside atmosphere of WASP-121b revealed by JWST/NIRISS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With dayside temperatures elevated enough for all atmospheric constituents to be present in gas form, ultra-hot Jupiters offer a unique opportunity to probe the composition of giant planets. We aim to infer the composition and thermal structure of the dayside atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b from two NIRISS$/$SOSS secondary eclipses observed as part of a full phase curve. We extract the eclipse spectrum of WASP-121b with two independent data reduction pipelines and analyse it using different atmospheric retrieval prescriptions to explore the effects of thermal dissociation, reflected light, and titanium condensation on the inferred atmospheric properties. We find that the observed dayside spectrum of WASP-121b is best fit by atmosphere models possessing a stratospheric inversion with temperatures reaching over 3000K, with spectral contributions from H2O, CO, VO, H-, and either TiO or reflected light. We measure the atmosphere of WASP-121b to be metal enriched (~10x stellar) but comparatively titanium poor (~1x stellar), potentially due to partial cold-trapping. The inferred C/O depends on model assumptions such as whether reflected light is included, ranging from being consistent with stellar if a geometric albedo of zero is assumed to being super-stellar for a freely fitted Ag = 0.16 +/- 0.02. The volatile-to-refractory ratio is measured to be consistent with the stellar value. We infer that WASP-121b has an atmosphere enriched in both volatile and refractory metals, but not in ultra-refractory titanium, suggesting the presence of a nightside cold-trap. Considering H2O dissociation is critical in free retrieval analyses, leading to order-of-magnitude differences in retrieved abundances for WASP-121b if neglected. Simple chemical equilibrium retrievals assuming that all species are governed by a single metallicity parameter drastically overpredict the TiO abundance.</description>

      <title>KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb and OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb: Mass Measurements for Two Super-Earth Microlensing Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb and OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb were the lowest mass-ratio microlensing planets at the time of discovery. For both events, microlensing parallax measurements from the Spitzer Space Telescope implied lens systems that were more distant and massive than those inferred from the ground-based parallax. Here, we report on the detection of excess flux aligned to the event locations using Keck Adaptive Optics imaging, which is consistent with the expected brightness of main-sequence hosts under the ground-based parallax, but inconsistent with that predicted by Spitzer. Based on the excess flux, ground-based parallax, and angular Einstein radius, we determine KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb to be a $4.2\pm0.5 M_\oplus$ planet orbiting a $0.70\pm0.07 M_\odot$ host at a projected separation of $3.1\pm0.3$ au, and OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb to be a $2.0\pm0.2 M_\oplus$ planet orbiting a $0.40\pm0.03 M_\odot$ host at a projected separation of $1.7\pm0.1$ au. We report on additional light-curve models for KMT-2018-BLG-0029 under the generalized inner-outer (offset) degeneracy, which were not reported in the original analysis. We point out inconsistencies in the inner/outer labeling of the degenerate models in the lens and source planes, and advocate for the lens-plane convention, which refers to the planet being closer or further to the host star compared to the image it perturbs. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of breaking this degeneracy via ground concurrent observations with the Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>VLT/MUSE Detection of the AB Aurigae b Protoplanet with $H _{\rm \alpha}$ Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze high-contrast, medium-spectral-resolution $H_{\rm \alpha}$ observations of the star AB Aurigae using the Very Large Telescope's Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In multiple epochs, MUSE detects the AB Aur b protoplanet discovered from Subaru/SCExAO data in emission at wavelengths slightly blue-shifted from the $H_{\rm \alpha}$ line center (i.e. at 6558.88--6560.13 \AA; $\sim$ -100 km s$^{-1}$) and in absorption at redshifted wavelengths (6562.8--6565.1 \AA; $\sim$ 75 km s$^{-1}$). AB Aur b's $H_{\rm \alpha}$ spectrum is inconsistent with that of the host star or the average residual disk spectrum and is dissimilar to that of PDS 70 b and c. Instead, the spectrum's shape resembles that of an inverse P Cygni profile seen in some accreting T Tauri stars and interpreted as evidence of infalling cold gas from accretion, although we cannot formally rule out all other nonaccretion origins for AB Aur b's MUSE detection. AB Aurigae hosts only the second protoplanetary system detected in $H_{\rm \alpha}$ thus far and the first with a source showing a spectrum resembling an inverse P Cygni profile. Future modeling and new optical data will be needed to assess how much of AB Aur b's emission source(s) originates from protoplanet accretion reprocessed by the disk, a localized scattered-light feature with a unique $H_{\rm \alpha}$ profile, or another mechanism.</description>

      <title>In Search of Decay: An Analysis of Transit Times of Hot Jupiters in Main Sequence and Post-Main Sequence Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal interactions are one of the primary drivers of orbital evolution for massive planets with short orbital periods. Tidal dissipation within host stars can cause the orbits of such planets to decay. However, the mechanisms of tidal dissipation are difficult to probe. Generally, tidal dissipation is parameterized by the modified stellar tidal quality factor, or $Q_{*}^{'}$, but the lack of observational evidence of orbital decay to confirm dissipation theories has resulted in orders of magnitude of uncertainty in $Q_{*}^{'}$. We present a new transit timing analysis of 54 systems with varying stellar evolutionary states in an attempt to search for orbital decay across multiple stages of stellar evolution. For each system, we obtained mid-transit times from new TESS data and evaluated potential departures from a linear ephemeris using the Bayesian Information Criterion. We then determined tidal quality factors using widely tested theoretical relations. Of the systems studied, 25 showed evidence of a decrease in orbital period over time and 8 showed evidence of a decrease that was inconsistent with 0 by three standard deviations: CoRoT-2, TrES-5, WASP-4, WASP-12, WASP-19, WASP-45, WASP-99, and XO-3. However, the significance of some of these detections may be influenced by unreliable transit time measurements. Similarly, we see that the lower limit on $Q_{*}^{'}$ for evolved systems is marginally lower than it is for the sample of all systems, though both limits are orders of magnitude below the expected theoretical values for both samples. These new constraints on transit times and $Q_{*}^{'}$ values will help to narrow the search for orbital decay in the future and place important constraints on current theories of star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>The mid-infrared spectrum of $\beta$ Pictoris b. First VLTI/MATISSE interferometric observations of an exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few spectra of directly-imaged exoplanets have been obtained in the mid-infrared (&gt; 3 $\mu$m). This region is particularly rich in molecular spectral signatures, whose measurements can help recover atmospheric parameters and provide a better understanding of giant planet formation and atmospheric dynamics. In the past years, exoplanet interferometry with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument has provided medium-resolution spectra of a dozen substellar companions in the near infrared. The 100-meter interferometric baselines allow for the stellar and planetary signals to be efficiently disentangled at close angular separations (&lt; 0.3''). We aim to extend this technique to the mid-infrared using MATISSE, the VLTI's mid-infrared spectro-interferometer. We take advantage of the fringe tracking and off-axis pointing capabilities recently brought by the GRA4MAT upgrade. Using this new mode, we observed the giant planet $\beta$ Pictoris b in L and M bands (2.75-5 $\mu$m) at a spectral resolution of 500. We developed a method to correct chromatic dispersion and non-common paths effects in the fringe phase and modelled the planet astrometry and stellar contamination. We obtained a high-signal-to-noise spectrum of $\beta$ Pictoris b, showing the planet continuum in L (for the first time) and M bands, which contains broad absorption features of H$_2$O and CO. In conjunction with a new GRAVITY spectrum, we modelled it with the ForMoSA nested sampling tool and the Exo-REM grid of atmospheric models, and found a solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio in the planet atmosphere. This study opens the way to the characterization of fainter and closer-in planets with MATISSE, which could complement the JWST at angular separations too close for it to obtain exoplanet spectra. Starting in 2025, the new adaptive optics system brought by the GRAVITY+ upgrade will further extend the detection limits of MATISSE.</description>

      <title>WIde Separation Planets In Time (WISPIT): Two directly imaged exoplanets around the Sun-like stellar binary WISPIT 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide separation gas giant planets present a challenge to current planet formation theories, and the detection and characterisation of these systems enables us to constrain their formation pathways. The WIde Separation Planets In Time (WISPIT) survey aims to detect and characterise wide separation planetary-mass companions over a range of ages from &lt;5 to 20 Myr around solar-type host stars at distances of 75-500 (median: 140) parsecs. The WISPIT survey carries out two 5 minute H-band exposures with the VLT/SPHERE instrument and IRDIS camera, separated by at least six months to identify co-moving companions via proper motion analysis. These two H-band observations in combination with a follow-up Ks-band observation were used to determine the colour-magnitude of the co-moving companions and to derive their masses by comparing to AMES-COND and AMES-DUSTY evolutionary tracks. We report the discovery of WISPIT 1b and WISPIT 1c, two gas giant exoplanets that are co-moving with the stellar binary WISPIT 1, which itself consists of a K4 star and M5.5 star in a multi-decadal orbit. The planets are at projected separations of 338 au and 840 au and have masses of 10 Mj and 4 Mj respectively. We identified two common proper motion planetary companions to a (previously unknown) stellar binary with a Sun-like primary. These targets are ideal for follow up characterisation with both ground and space-based telescopes. Monitoring of the orbit with the GRAVITY interferometer will place constraints on their eccentricity, and spectroscopic characterisation will identify the composition and metallicity, providing information on their formation pathways.</description>

      <title>A 3D thermophysical model for binary asteroid systems: Application to the BYORP effect on (175706) 1996 FG3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential heating and radiation on asymmetric asteroids can cause measurable changes in their rotation rates and spin axes, known as the YORP effect. In binary systems, such radiation-driven torques can change the mutual asteroid orbits, termed the binary YORP or BYORP effect. To study how binary asteroid shapes and thermophysical properties affect surface temperatures and BYORP, we developed a new 3D thermophysical model which balances insolation, 1D conduction, visible light reflection, and mutual heating through scattered infrared radiation. Using 3D ray tracing, we include eclipses, shadowing from horizons and topography, and mutual radiation exchange between the primary and secondary asteroids. We perform global modeling of the binary asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3, a Janus mission target. At perihelion, we find that the 1996 FG3 system experiences temperatures between 100 and 475 K. We find that eclipses and thermal inertia can alter secondary surface temperatures by up to 14%, with a mean difference due to radiation from the primary of just over 1%. We also present a model for calculating the BYORP effect using binary thermophysical model results. This model compares well to analytical approximations of the BYORP coefficient B, and suggests that thermal effects like eclipses and thermal inertia can reduce torque in the 1996 FG3 system and alter the BYORP coefficient by up to several percent. For 1996 FG3, eclipses alter B by approximately 7%, resulting in a lower torque on the secondary. Though small, in the absence of tidal effects this would reduce the contraction of the semimajor axis by about 20 meters over 10,000 years. Our findings suggest that thermal effects can alter temperatures and BYORP calculations sufficiently that they should be included when modeling binaries. The relative importance of each effect is predicted to vary with the properties of the studied system.</description>

      <title>VLT/CRIRES+ observations of warm Neptune WASP-107 b: Molecular detections and challenges in ground-based transmission spectroscopy of cooler and cloudy exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheres of transiting exoplanets can be studied spectroscopically using space-based or ground-based observations. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so there are benefits to both approaches. This is especially true for challenging targets such as cooler, smaller exoplanets whose atmospheres likely contain many molecular species and cloud decks.
  We aim to study the atmosphere of the warm Neptune-like exoplanet WASP-107 b (Teq~740 K). Several molecular species have been detected in this exoplanet in recent space-based JWST studies, and we aim to confirm and expand upon these detections using ground-based VLT, evaluating how well our findings agree with previously retrieved atmospheric parameters.
  We observe two transits of WASP-107 b with VLT/CRIRES+ and create cross-correlation templates of the target atmosphere based on retrieval results from JWST studies. We create different templates to investigate the impact of varying volume mixing ratios of species and inclusion or exclusion of clouds. Considering this target's observational challenges, we create simulated observations prior to evaluating real data to assess expected detection significances.
  We report detections of two molecular species, CO (~6 S/N) and H2O (~4.5 S/N). This confirms previous space-based detections and demonstrates, for the first time, the capability of VLT/CRIRES+ to detect species in targets cooler than hot Jupiters using transmission spectroscopy. We show our analysis is sensitive to cloud inclusion, but less so to different volume mixing ratios. Interestingly, our detection deviates from its expected location in our Kp-vsys diagrams, and we speculate on possible reasons for this. We demonstrate that the error budget for relatively cooler exoplanets is severely reduced in comparison to hotter exoplanets, and underline need for further work in context of high-resolution spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Wide Separation Planets In Time (WISPIT): Discovery of a Gap H$\alpha$ Protoplanet WISPIT 2b with MagAO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excellent (&lt;25 mas) H$_{\alpha}$ images of the star TYC 5709-354-1 led to the discovery of a rare H$_{\alpha}$ protoplanet. This star was discovered by the WISPIT survey to have a large multi-ring transitional disk, and is hereafter WISPIT 2. Our H$_{\alpha}$ images of 2025, April 13 and April 16 discovered an accreting (H$_{\alpha}$ in emission) protoplanet: WISPIT 2b (r=309.43$\pm$1.56 mas; (~54 au deprojected), PA=242.21$\pm$0.41 degrees) likely clearing a dust-free gap between the two brightest dust rings in the transitional disk. Our SNR=12.5 detection gave an H$_{\alpha}$ ASDI contrast of (6.5$\pm$0.5)x10$^{-4}$ and a H$_{\alpha}$ line flux of (1.29$\pm$0.28)x10$^{-15}$ erg/s/cm$^2$. We also present L' photometry from LBT/LMIRcam of the planet (L'=15.30$\pm$0.05 mag) which, when coupled with an age of 5.1$^{+2.4}_{-1.3}$ Myr, yields a planet mass estimate of 5.3$\pm$1.0 Mjup from the DUSTY evolutionary models. WISPIT 2b is accreting at 2.25$^{-0.17}_{+3.75}$x10$^{-12}$ Msun/yr. WISPIT 2b is very similar to the other H$_{\alpha}$ protoplanets in terms of mass, age, flux, and accretion rate. The inclination of the system (${\it i}$=44 degrees) is also, surprisingly, very similar to the other known H$\alpha$ protoplanet systems which all cluster from 37$\leq{\it i}\leq$52 degrees. We argue this clustering has only a ~1.0% (2.6 sigma) probability of occurring randomly, and so we speculate that magnetospherical accretion might have a preferred inclination range (~37-52 degrees) for the direct (cloud free, low extinction) line of sight to the H-alpha line formation/shock region. We also find at 110mas (~15au deprojected) a close companion candidate (CC1) which may be consistent with an inner dusty 9$\pm$4 Mjup planet.</description>

      <title>WIde Separation Planets In Time (WISPIT): A Gap-clearing Planet in a Multi-ringed Disk around the Young Solar-type Star WISPIT 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decades several thousand exoplanet systems have been discovered around evolved, main-sequence stars, revealing a wide diversity in their architectures. To understand how the planet formation process can lead to vastly different outcomes in system architecture we have to study the starting conditions of planet formation within the disks around young stars. In this study we are presenting high resolution direct imaging observations with VLT/SPHERE of the young ($\sim$5 Myr), nearby ($\sim$133 pc), solar-analog designated as WISPIT 2($=$ TYC~5709-354-1). These observations were taken as part of our survey program that explores the formation and orbital evolution of wide-separation gas giants. WISPIT 2 was observed in four independent epochs using polarized light and total intensity observations. They reveal for the first time an extended (380 au) disk in scattered light with a multi-ringed sub-structure. We directly detect a young proto-planet WISPIT 2b, embedded in a disk gap and show that it is co-moving with its host star. Multiple SPHERE epochs demonstrate that it shows orbital motion consistent with Keplerian motion in the observed disk gap. Our $H$ and $K_s$-band photometric data are consistent with thermal emission from a young planet. By comparison with planet evolutionary models, we find a mass of the planet of $4.9^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ Jupiter masses. This mass is also consistent with the width of the observed disk gap, retrieved from hydrodynamic models. WISPIT 2b is the first unambiguous planet detection in a multi-ringed disk, making the WISPIT 2 system the ideal laboratory to study planet-disk interaction and subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Is ozone a reliable proxy for molecular oxygen? III. The impact of CH$_4$ on the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship for Earth-like atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for life in the Universe, molecular oxygen (O$_2$) combined with a reducing species, such as methane (CH$_4$), is considered a promising disequilibrium biosignature. In cases where it would be difficult or impossible to detect O$_2$ (e.g., mid-IR or low O$_2$ levels), it has been suggested that ozone (O$_3$), the photochemical product of O$_2$, could be used as a proxy for determining the abundance of O$_2$. As the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship is nonlinear, the goal of this series of papers is to explore how it would change for different host stars and atmospheric compositions and learning how to use O$_3$ to infer O$_2$. We used photochemistry and climate modeling to further explore the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship by modeling Earth-like planets with the present atmospheric level (PAL) of O$_2$ between 0.01% to 150% along with high and low CH$_4$ abundances of 1000% and 10% PAL, respectively. Methane is of interest not only because it is a biosignature, but also the source of hydrogen atoms for hydrogen oxide (HO$_x$) which destroys O$_3$ through catalytic cycles and acts as a catalyst for the smog mechanism of O$_3$ formation in the lower atmosphere. We find varying CH$_4$ causes changes to the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship in ways that are highly dependent on both host star and O$_2$ abundance. A striking result for high CH$_4$ models in high O$_2$ atmospheres around hotter hosts is that enough CH$_4$ is efficiently converted into H$_2$O to significantly impact stratospheric temperatures, and therefore the formation/destruction rates of O$_3$. Changes in HO$_x$ also influenced the HO$_x$ catalytic cycle and smog O$_3$, causing variations in harmful UV reaching the surface as well as changes in the 9.6~$\mu$m O$_3$ feature in emission spectra. This demonstrates the need to explore the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship in order to use O$_3$ as a reliable proxy for O$_2$ in future observations.</description>

      <title>Silane-Methane Competition in Sub-Neptune Atmospheres as a Diagnostic of Metallicity and Magma Oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope is characterising the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes. The presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes is expected to strongly alter the chemistry of their envelopes (100 bar-100 kbar) and atmospheres (1 mbar-100 bar). At the magma ocean-envelope boundary (MEB, &gt;10 kbar), gas properties deviate from ideality, yet the effects of real gas behaviour on chemical equilibria remain underexplored. Here, we compute equilibrium between magma-gas and gas-gas reactions using real gas equations of state in the H-He-C-N-O-Si system for TOI-421b, a canonical hot sub-Neptune potentially hosting a magma ocean. We find that H and N are the most soluble in magma, followed by He and C. We fit real gas equations of state to experimental data on SiH$_4$, and show that, for a fully molten mantle, SiH$_4$ dominates at the MEB under accreted gas metallicity of 1$\times$ solar, but is supplanted by CH$_4$ at 100$\times$ solar. Lower mantle melt fractions lower both magma-derived Si abundances in the envelope and the solubility of H and He in magma, yielding H$_2$- and He-rich envelopes. Projecting equilibrium chemistry through the atmosphere (1 mbar-100 bar), we find that condensation of $\beta$-quartz 'clouds' depletes Si-bearing gases, although SiH$_4$ remains abundant at solar metallicity. SiH$_4$/CH$_4$ ratios increase with mantle melt fraction and decrease with metallicity. These effects also deplete H$_2$ via CH$_4$ and SiH$_4$ formation and the dissolution of H$_2$ into magma. The competition between SiH$_4$ and CH$_4$ presents a diagnostic of metallicity and magma oceans. The corollary is that H$_2$- and He-rich, SiH$_4$- and CH$_4$-poor (&lt;5%) atmospheres may indicate a limited role or absence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Transiting Planetary Debris near the Roche Limit of a White Dwarf on a 4.97$\,$hr Orbit -- and its Vanishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of deep, irregular, periodic transits towards the white dwarf ZTF$\,$J1944$+$4557 using follow-up time-series photometry and spectroscopy from Palomar, Keck, McDonald, Perkins, and Lowell observatories. We find a predominant period of 4.9704$\,$hr, consistent with an orbit near the Roche limit of the white dwarf, with individual dips over 30$\%$ deep and lasting between 15 and 40 minutes. Similar to the first known white dwarf with transiting debris, WD$\,$1145$+$017, the transit events are well-defined with prominent out-of-transit phases where the white dwarf appears unobscured. Spectroscopy concurrent with transit photometry reveals the average Ca$\,$K equivalent width remains constant in and out of transit. The broadening observed in several absorption features cannot be reproduced by synthetic photospheric models, suggesting the presence of circumstellar gas. Simultaneous $g+r$- and $g+i$-band light curves from the CHIMERA instrument reveal no color dependence to the transit depths, requiring transiting dust grains to have sizes $s \gtrsim0.2\,\mu$m. The transit morphologies appear to be constantly changing at a rate faster than the orbital period. Overall transit activity varies in the system, with transit features completely disappearing during the seven months between our 2023 and 2024 observing seasons and then reappearing in 2025$~$March, still repeating at 4.9704$\,$hr. Our observations of the complete cessation and resumption of transit activity provide a novel laboratory for constraining the evolution of disrupted debris and processes like disk exhaustion and replenishment timescales at white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Chemical evolution imprints in the rare isotopes of nearby M dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, collectively termed metals, were created inside stars and dispersed through space at the final stages of stellar evolution. The relative amounts of different isotopes (variants of the same element with different masses) in stellar atmospheres provide clues about how our galaxy evolved chemically over billions of years. M dwarfs are small, cool, long-lived stars that comprise three-quarters of all stars in our galaxy. Their spectra exhibit rich fingerprints of their composition, making them potential tracers of chemical evolution. We measure rare carbon and oxygen isotopes in 32 nearby M dwarfs spanning a range of metallicities using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We find that stars with higher metal content have lower 12C/13C ratios, indicating they formed from material progressively enriched in 13C over time. This pattern is consistent with models where novae eruptions contributed significant amounts of 13C to the interstellar medium over the past few billion years. Our measurements of 16O/18O ratio match theoretical predictions and suggest that metal-rich stars reach 16O/18O ratios significantly lower than the Sun. These results establish M dwarfs as tracers of chemical enrichment throughout cosmic history.</description>

      <title>The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole M87* and our solar system may all have in common the presence of a massive pointlike distant companion perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. To this aim, the long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of the relative motion of a gravitationally bound two-body system acted upon by a massive remote perturber are analytically worked out in full generality and presented in a way facilitating a straightforward application to those and other potentially interesting astronomical scenarios. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</description>

      <title>A new multifluid method for dusty astrophysical flows. Application to turbulent protostellar collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and planets form in collapsing clouds of gas and dust. The presence of dust grains and their local distribution play a significant role throughout the protostellar sequence, from the thermodynamics and the chemistry of molecular clouds to the opacity of collapsing protostellar cores and the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field and down to planet formation in young and evolved disks. We aim to simulate the dynamics of the dust, considering the whole range of grain sizes, from few nanometers to millimeters. We implemented a neutral pressureless multifluid that samples the dust size distribution in the RAMSES code. This multifluid is dynamically coupled to the gas via a drag source term and self-gravity, relying on the Eulerian approach. We designed a Riemann solver for the gas and dust mixture that prevents unphysical dust-to-gas ratio variations for well-coupled grains. We illustrated the capacities of the code by performing simulations of a protostellar collapse down to the formation of a first hydrostatic core, both for small and large dust grains. Grains over 100 microns significantly decouple from the gas. The spatial maps and the probability density functions indicate that dust enrichment within the first hydrostatic core and in some locations of the envelope increases as a function of the grain size and the level of initial turbulence. Thanks to the novel Riemann solver, we recovered the terminal velocity regime, even at low resolution. Moreover, we successfully extended it to regimes where the grain inertia matters. The multifluid module performs the coupling between the dust and the gas self-consistently all through the dynamical scales. The dust enrichment in the first hydrostatic core and the envelope have been revised here, assuming the initial turbulence and grain sizes. This enables us to probe new potential conditions for planet formation.</description>

      <title>Precovery Observations of 3I/ATLAS from TESS Suggests Possible Distant Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third macroscopic interstellar object detected traversing the Solar System. Since its initial discovery on UT 01 July 2025, hundreds of hours on a range of observational facilities have been dedicated to measure the physical properties of this object. These observations have provided astrometry to refine the orbital solution, photometry to measure the color, a rotation period and secular light curve, and spectroscopy to characterize the composition of the coma. Here, we report precovery photometry of 3I/ATLAS as observed with NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). 3I/ATLAS was observed nearly continuously by TESS from UT 07 May 2025 to 02 June 2025. We use the shift-stack method to create deep stack images to recover the object. These composite images reveal that 3I/ATLAS has an average TESS magnitude of $T_\textrm{mag} = 20.83 \pm 0.05, 19.28 \pm 0.05$ and an absolute visual magnitude of $H_V = 13.72 \pm 0.35; 12.52 \pm 0.35$, the latter being consistent with magnitudes reported in July 2025. When coupled with recent HST images deriving a nucleus size of R$&lt;$2.8 km (H$&gt;$15.4), our measurements suggest that 3I/ATLAS may have been active out at $\sim 6$ au. Additionally, we extract a $\sim 20$ day light curve and find no statistically significant evidence of a nucleus rotation period. Nevertheless, the data presented here are some of the earliest precovery images of 3I/ATLAS and may be used in conjunction with future observations to constrain the properties of our third interstellar interloper.</description>

      <title>Destruction of "Peas in a Pod?" A Candidate Multi-planet System Around the Nearby, Bright Star, HD208487</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-investigate the HD208487 system to test the reality of the proposed HD208487c world. We also search for additional companions using applied Bayesian statistics and 15+ years of new RV data from the HARPS and the PFS instruments that were taken post-discovery of HD208487b.
  The RV data was analyzed with GLS Periodograms, followed by Bayesian analysis using the EMPEROR code. We scrutinised various stellar activity indices to search for any corresponding peaks in the power spectra, correlations with the RV measurements, or significant signals from a Bayesian analysis methodology. Finally, photometric data was checked to test for any transits or possible activity manifestations that could lead to possible false RV signals or excess noise.
  Our analysis points towards a candidate second planet in the system, positioned near the period of a previously proposed and subsequently challenged signal. This signal, HD208487c, would relate to a cool Saturn with an orbital period of 923.06 +2.02 -2.76 d and a minimum mass of Mj sini = 0.32 +/- 0.01Mj. Our analysis also gives rise to a newly discovered candidate planet, HD208487d, which would be the result of a cool super-Neptune/sub-Saturn with a period of 1380.13 +19.20 -8.25 d and a minimum mass of Mj sini = 0.15 +/- 0.01Mj. Neither stellar activity indices nor photometric data show signals statistically matching these periods.
  We have uncovered a candidate three planet system that would consist of an inner gas giant, a central Saturn and an outer super-Neptune/sub-Saturn. A dynamical analysis suggests that gravitational scattering of an initially ordered, equally-spaced system in a long resonant chain of six Neptunes can explain the current proposed architecture of HD208487. More RVs may also shed light on the reality of a fourth Doppler signal uncovered in the data that sits close to the 2:1 period-ratio with signal of HD208487c.</description>

      <title>Machine learning revolution for exoplanet direct imaging detection: transformer architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directly imaging exoplanets is a formidable challenge due to extreme contrast ratios and quasi-static speckle noise, motivating the exploration of advanced post-processing methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise, their inherent limitations in capturing long-range dependencies in image sequences hinder their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that combines a CNN feature extractor with a Transformer encoder to leverage temporal information, modeling the signature of a planet's coherent motion across an observation sequence. We first validated the model on a purely synthetic dataset, where it demonstrated excellent performance. While the final metrics varied slightly between training runs, our reported trial achieved 100.0% accuracy, a 100.0% F1-score, and a position accuracy of 0.72 pixels, showing strong results on this specific test case in comparison to traditional methods like median subtraction and PCA-KLIP. To assess its viability on realistic data, we retrained the model on a semi-synthetic dataset created by injecting planet signals into actual high-contrast imaging observations of the TW Hya protoplanetary disk from JWST. The model successfully identified the injected signals with high confidence, confirming its ability to function amidst complex, correlated noise and bright disk features. This work serves as a successful proof-of-concept, demonstrating that a CNN-Transformer architecture holds significant promise as a fast, accurate, and automated method for exoplanet detection in the large datasets expected from current and future high-contrast imaging instruments.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh Criterion: Resolution Limits of Astronomical Periodograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rayleigh criterion determines the resolution limit of a periodogram, which is the minimum frequency separation required to barely resolve two sinusoids. Failing to consider the Rayleigh criterion may result in incorrect interpretations of long-period signals or spurious claims that two closely spaced periodogram peaks represent two distinct physical processes. We demonstrate how applying the Rayleigh criterion can help observers avoid false positive detections caused by uneven observing cadence or insufficient observing time baseline. We present three synthetic datasets that illustrate (1) a single oscillation with a split Lomb-Scargle periodogram peak resulting from uneven observing cadence can be mistaken for two oscillations if the Rayleigh criterion is neglected, (2) oversampling a periodogram's frequency grid does not improve resolution, and (3) observing time baseline requirements for resolving two closely spaced oscillations. We use the Rayleigh criterion to revisit detections of planets, stellar activity, and differential rotation from four published datasets. We show that the frequency separation between planet 55~Cnc~d and the activity cycle is too small to distinguish the two phenomena based on published radial velocities (RVs) alone. Likewise, the contested 4970-day planet orbiting HD~99492 cannot be statistically separated from zero frequency. We determine that a cubic polynomial better explains the long-term RV variability of Barnard's star than a sinusoid model. Finally, our re-analysis of {\it Kepler} observations of two active stars shows that the signals previously attributed to differential rotation can be modeled by a Gaussian process with a single quasiperiodicity. This work demonstrates the importance of the Rayleigh criterion when constructing a time-domain model.</description>
