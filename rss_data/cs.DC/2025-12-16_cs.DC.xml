      <title>Accelerating Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication on GPUs with Processing Near HBMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpGEMM) is a fundamental operation in numerous scientific computing and data analytics applications, often bottlenecked by irregular memory access patterns. This paper presents Hash based Multi-phase SpGEMM on GPU and the Acceleration of Indirect Memory Access (AIA) technique, a novel custom near-memory processing approach to optimizing SpGEMM on GPU HBM. Our hardware-software co-designed framework for SpGEMM demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling complex, application-specific workloads. We evaluate our approach on various graph workloads, including graph contraction, Markov clustering, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), showcasing its practical applicability. For graph analytics applications, AIA demonstrates up to 17.3% time reduction from the software-only implementation, while achieving time reduction of 76.5% for Graph Contraction and 58.4% for Markov Clustering compared to cuSPARSE. For GNN training applications with structured global pruning, our hybrid approach delivers an average of 1.43x speedup over software-only implementation across six benchmark datasets and three architectures (GCN, GIN, GraphSAGE), and shows 1.95x speedup for GNN workloads when compared to cuSPARSE, with up to 4.18x gains on large-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>Near-Zero-Overhead Freshness for Recommendation Systems via Inference-Side Model Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) underpin personalized services but face a critical freshness-accuracy tradeoff due to massive parameter synchronization overheads. Production DLRMs deploy decoupled training/inference clusters, where synchronizing petabyte-scale embedding tables (EMTs) causes multi-minute staleness, degrading recommendation quality and revenue. We observe that (1) inference nodes exhibit sustained CPU underutilization (peak &lt;= 20%), and (2) EMT gradients possess intrinsic low-rank structure, enabling compact update representation. We present LiveUpdate, a system that eliminates inter-cluster synchronization by colocating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) trainers within inference nodes. LiveUpdate addresses two core challenges: (1) dynamic rank adaptation via singular value monitoring to constrain memory overhead (&lt;2% of EMTs), and (2) NUMA-aware resource scheduling with hardware-enforced QoS to eliminate update inference contention (P99 latency impact &lt;20ms). Evaluations show LiveUpdate reduces update costs by 2x versus delta-update baselines while achieving higher accuracy within 1-hour windows. By transforming idle inference resources into freshness engines, LiveUpdate delivers online model updates while outperforming state-of-the-art delta-update methods by 0.04% to 0.24% in accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Conflict-Aware Resource Management Framework for the Computing Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing device heterogeneity and decentralization requirements in the computing continuum (i.e., spanning edge, fog, and cloud) introduce new challenges in resource orchestration. In such environments, agents are often responsible for optimizing resource usage across deployed services. However, agent decisions can lead to persistent conflict loops, inefficient resource utilization, and degraded service performance. To overcome such challenges, we propose a novel framework for adaptive conflict resolution in resource-oriented orchestration using a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach. The framework enables handling resource conflicts across deployments and integrates a DRL model trained to mediate such conflicts based on real-time performance feedback and historical state information. The framework has been prototyped and validated on a Kubernetes-based testbed, illustrating its methodological feasibility and architectural resilience. Preliminary results show that the framework achieves efficient resource reallocation and adaptive learning in dynamic scenarios, thus providing a scalable and resilient solution for conflict-aware orchestration in the computing continuum.</description>

      <title>Reputation-Based Leader Election under Partial Synchrony: Towards a Protocol-Independent Abstraction with Enhanced Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leader election serves a well-defined role in leader-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols. Existing reputation-based leader election frameworks for partially synchronous BFTs suffer from either protocol-specific proofs, narrow applicability, or unbounded recovery after network stabilization, leaving an open problem. This paper presents a novel protocol-independent abstraction formalizing generic correctness properties and effectiveness guarantees for leader election under partial synchrony, enabling protocol-independent analysis and design. Building on this, we design the Sliding Window Leader Election (SWLE) mechanism. SWLE dynamically adjusts leader nominations via consensus-behavior-based reputation scores, enforcing Byzantine-cost amplification. We demonstrate SWLE introduces minimal extra overhead to the base protocol and prove it satisfies all abstraction properties and provides superior effectiveness. We show, with a 16-server deployment across 4 different regions in northern China, SWLE achieves up to 4.2x higher throughput, 75% lower latency and 27% Byzantine leader frequency compared to the state-of-the-art solution under common Byzantine faults, while maintaining efficiency in fault-free scenarios.</description>

      <title>HetRL: Efficient Reinforcement Learning for LLMs in Heterogeneous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale and new GPUs are released even more frequently, there is an increasing demand for LLM post-training in heterogeneous environments to fully leverage underutilized mid-range or previous-generation GPUs across regions and alleviate the shortage of homogeneous high-end GPUs within a single region. However, achieving high-performance reinforcement learning (RL) training for LLMs on such computing resources remains challenging because the workflow involves multiple models and tasks with complex computation and data dependencies. In this paper, we present HetRL, a distributed system for efficient RL training in infrastructures with heterogeneous GPUs and networks. HetRL formulates the scheduling of RL training in heterogeneous environments as a constrained joint optimization problem and introduces a novel scheduling algorithm that (1) decomposes the complex search space with a multi-level search framework; and (2) allocates the search budget via successive halving. Our extensive evaluation, consuming 20,000 GPU-hours, shows that HetRL delivers up to 9.17x the throughput of state-of-the-art systems, and 3.17x on average, under various workloads and settings.</description>

      <title>Strategic Server Deployment under Uncertainty in Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Server deployment is a fundamental task in mobile edge computing: where to place the edge servers and what user cells to assign to them. To make this decision is context-specific, but common goals are 1) computing efficiency: maximize the amount of workload processed by the edge, and 2) communication efficiency: minimize the communication cost between the cells and their assigned servers. We focus on practical scenarios where the user workload in each cell is unknown and time-varying, and so are the effective capacities of the servers. Our research problem is to choose a subset of candidate servers and assign them to the user cells such that the above goals are sustainably achieved under the above uncertainties. We formulate this problem as a stochastic bilevel optimization, which is strongly NP-hard and unseen in the literature. By approximating the objective function with submodular functions, we can utilize state-of-the-art greedy algorithms for submodular maximization to effectively solve our problem. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using real-world data, showing its superiority to alternative methods; the improvement can be as high as 55%</description>

      <title>Ethical Risk Analysis of L2 Rollups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layer 2 rollups improve throughput and fees, but can reintroduce risk through operator discretion and information asymmetry. We ask which operator and governance designs produce ethically problematic user risk. We adapt Ethical Risk Analysis to rollup architectures, build a role-based taxonomy of decision authority and exposure, and pair the framework with two empirical signals, a cross sectional snapshot of 129 projects from L2BEAT and a hand curated incident set covering 2022 to 2025. We analyze mechanisms that affect risks to users funds, including upgrade timing and exit windows, proposer liveness and whitelisting, forced inclusion usability, and data availability choices. We find that ethical hazards rooted in L2 components control arrangements are widespread: instant upgrades without exit windows appear in about 86 percent of projects, and proposer controls that can freeze withdrawals in about 50 percent. Reported incidents concentrate in sequencer liveness and inclusion, consistent with these dependencies. We translate these findings into ethically grounded suggestions on mitigation strategies including technical components and governance mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Energy Prediction For Parallellized LLM Inference With PIE-P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), energy costs of running LLMs is quickly becoming a critical concern. However, precisely measuring the energy consumption of LLMs is often infeasible because hardware-based power monitors are not always accessible and software-based energy measurement tools are not accurate. While various prediction techniques have been developed to estimate LLM energy consumption, these approaches are limited to single-GPU environments and thus are not applicable to modern LLM inference which is typically parallelized across multiple GPUs. In this work, we remedy this gap and introduce PIE-P, a fine-grained energy prediction framework for multi-GPU inference, including tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism. Predicting the energy under parallelized inference is complicated by the non-determinism in inter-GPU communication, additional communication overheads, and difficulties in isolating energy during the communication/synchronization phase. We develop a scalable prediction framework that addresses these issues via precise sampling, fine-grained modeling of inter-GPU communication, and careful accounting of parallelization overhead. Our evaluation results show that PIE-P yields accurate and fine-grained energy predictions across parallelism strategies, significantly outperforming baselines.</description>

      <title>PROSERVE: Unified Multi-Priority Request Scheduling for LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) for interactive applications necessitates serving systems that can handle thousands of concurrent requests with diverse Service Level Objective (SLO) requirements. A critical yet often overlooked dimension in this context is the inherent priority difference among clients; for instance, business-critical functions demand higher performance guarantees, as fulfilling such requests yields significantly greater business value. However, existing LLM serving schedulers fail to jointly optimize for both SLO attainment and client-level priorities.
  To bridge this gap, we first \textit{formalize multi-priority request scheduling as a service gain maximization problem}, where satisfying latency requirements for requests of different priorities contributes varying levels of gain. We then propose PROSERVE, a unified two-tier scheduling framework designed to maximize overall service gain. At the engine level, SlideBatching dynamically adapts batch formation and request ordering under varying load conditions, employing a sliding boundary mechanism to balance deadline-first and density-first strategies. At the service level, GoRouting performs gain-oriented and capability-aware dispatching across distributed instances, proactively reserving capacity for future high-priority or long requests. Extensive evaluation across four open-source datasets and a real-world industrial trace demonstrates that \systemname{} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving system gain by up to 35% and boosting SLO attainment by up to 52%.</description>

      <title>FlashFuser: Expanding the Scale of Kernel Fusion for Compute-Intensive Operators via Inter-Core Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of computation throughput continues to outpace improvements in memory bandwidth, making many deep learning workloads memory-bound. Kernel fusion is a key technique to alleviate this problem, but the fusion strategies of existing compilers and frameworks are limited to using local scratchpad memory. When the intermediate results exceed the limited capacity (such as FFN), the fusion fails. Although modern GPUs (like the NVIDIA H100) now incorporate an inter-core connection mechanism known as Distributed Shared Memory(DSM)--providing a larger, high-bandwidth, and low-latency on-chip memory pool--this hardware potential has yet to be exploited by software frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present FlashFuser, the first compiler framework to utilize inter-core connection for kernel fusion on modern GPUs. FlashFuser extends established fusion techniques to the DSM domain through three core contributions. First, we propose a powerful DSM-based communication abstraction that formalizes complex cluster-based data exchange patterns, such as reduce, shuffle and multiply. Second, we introduce a dataflow analyzer that generalizes loop scheduling, resource mapping, and tile selection to the distributed memory hierarchy; it determines the optimal execution order and tile sizes by quantifying data movement across memory levels. Finally, FlashFuser integrates these components into a unified search engine that employs analytical cost modeling and DSM-aware pruning strategies to efficiently discover the optimal execution plan. Our evaluation on an NVIDIA H100 GPU shows that FlashFuser reduces memory access by 58% and delivers kernel speedups of 3.3x against highly-tuned libraries and 4.1x against state-of-the-art compilers, resulting in a 1.24x end-to-end speedup.</description>

      <title>Toward Self-Healing Networks-on-Chip: RL-Driven Routing in 2D Torus Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate adaptive minimal routing in 2D torus networks on chip NoCs under node fault conditions comparing a reinforcement learning RL based strategy to an adaptive routing baseline A torus topology is used for its low diameter high connectivity properties The RL approach models each router as an agent that learns to forward packets based on network state while the adaptive scheme uses fixed minimal paths with simple rerouting around faults We implement both methods in simulation injecting up to 50 node faults uniformly at random Key metrics are measured 1 throughput vs offered load at fault density 02 2 packet delivery ratio PDR vs fault density and 3 a fault adaptive score FT vs fault density Experimental results show the RL method achieves significantly higher throughput at high load approximately 2030 gain and maintains higher reliability under increasing faults The RL router delivers more packets per cycle and adapts to faults by exploiting path diversity whereas the adaptive scheme degrades sharply as faults accumulate In particular the RL approach preserves end to end connectivity longer PDR remains above 90 until approximately 3040 faults while adaptive PDR drops to approximately 70 at the same point The fault adaptive score likewise favors RL routing Thus RL based adaptive routing demonstrates clear advantages in throughput and fault resilience for torus NoCs</description>

      <title>SPARS: A Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Simulator for Power Management in HPC Job Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) clusters consume enormous amounts of energy, with idle nodes as a major source of waste. Powering down unused nodes can mitigate this problem, but poorly timed transitions introduce long delays and reduce overall performance. To address this trade-off, we present SPARS, a reinforcement learning-enabled simulator for power management in HPC job scheduling. SPARS integrates job scheduling and node power state management within a discrete-event simulation framework. It supports traditional scheduling policies such as First Come First Served and EASY Backfilling, along with enhanced variants that employ reinforcement learning agents to dynamically decide when nodes should be powered on or off. Users can configure workloads and platforms in JSON format, specifying job arrivals, execution times, node power models, and transition delays. The simulator records comprehensive metrics-including energy usage, wasted power, job waiting times, and node utilization-and provides Gantt chart visualizations to analyze scheduling dynamics and power transitions. Unlike widely used Batsim-based frameworks that rely on heavy inter-process communication, SPARS provides lightweight event handling and consistent simulation results, making experiments easier to reproduce and extend. Its modular design allows new scheduling heuristics or learning algorithms to be integrated with minimal effort. By providing a flexible, reproducible, and extensible platform, SPARS enables researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate power-aware scheduling strategies, explore the trade-offs between energy efficiency and performance, and accelerate the development of sustainable HPC operations.</description>

      <title>Temporal parallelisation of continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori trajectory estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a parallel-in-time method for computing continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) trajectory estimates of the states of partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with the goal of improving computational speed on parallel architectures. The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: An AI-Empowered Training Stack on Early-Life Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing variety of AI accelerators is being considered for large-scale training. However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period. Together, these advances establish SIGMA, which not only tackles the critical challenges of large-scale training but also establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and platform innovation, offering a robust, cost-effective alternative to prevailing established accelerator stacks and significantly advancing AI capabilities and scalability.

      <title>Janus: Disaggregating Attention and Experts for Scalable MoE Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model inference is challenging due to high resource demands and dynamic workloads. Existing solutions often deploy the entire model as a single monolithic unit, which applies a unified resource configuration to both attention and expert modules despite their different requirements, leading to limited scalability and resource inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently. Janus incorporates three key designs for efficient, disaggregated MoE inference. First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency. Third, Janus performs fine-grained resource management to dynamically adjust expert placement and independently scale attention and MoE resources to improve overall efficiency. Evaluation shows Janus achieves up to 3.9 higher perGPU throughput than state-of-the-art systems while meeting per-token latency requirements.</description>

      <title>astroCAMP: A Community Benchmark and Co-Design Framework for Sustainable SKA-Scale Radio Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project will operate one of the world's largest continuous scientific data systems, sustaining petascale imaging under strict power caps. Yet, current radio-interferometric pipelines utilize only a small fraction of hardware peak performance, typically 4-14%, due to memory and I/O bottlenecks, resulting in poor energy efficiency and high operational and carbon costs. Progress is further limited by the absence of standardised metrics and fidelity tolerances, preventing principled hardware-software co-design and rigorous exploration of quality-efficiency trade-offs. We introduce astroCAMP, a framework for guiding the co-design of next-generation imaging pipelines and sustainable HPC architectures that maximise scientific return within SKA's operational and environmental limits. astroCAMP provides: (1) a unified, extensible metric suite covering scientific fidelity, computational performance, sustainability, and lifecycle economics; (2) standardised SKA-representative datasets and reference outputs enabling reproducible benchmarking across CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators; and (3) a multi-objective co-design formulation linking scientific-quality constraints to time-, energy-, carbon-to-solution, and total cost of ownership. We release datasets, benchmarking results, and a reproducibility kit, and evaluate co-design metrics for WSClean and IDG on an AMD EPYC 9334 processor and an NVIDIA H100 GPU. Further, we illustrate the use of astroCAMP for heterogeneous CPU-FPGA design-space exploration, and its potential to facilitate the identification of Pareto-optimal operating points for SKA-scale imaging deployments. Last, we make a call to the SKA community to define quantifiable fidelity metrics and thresholds to accelerate principled optimisation for SKA-scale imaging.</description>

      <title>Design in Tiles: Automating GEMM Deployment on Tile-Based Many-PE Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tile-based many-Processing Element (PE) accelerators can achieve competitive performance on General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM), but they are extremely hard to program, as their optimal software mapping is deeply coupled with hardware design which is unwieldy to manual deployment. We propose "Design in Tiles (DiT)", an automated framework connecting a deployment toolchain with a configurable executable model for these accelerators. For evaluation, we apply our framework to GEMM targeting a large acceleration configuration (e.g., 32x32 tiles, 1979 TFLOPS@FP8, 4 TB/s Bandwidth) comparable to an NVIDIA GH200. We achieve higher PE utilization than GH200 with its expert-tuned GEMM libraries, achieving 1.2-2.0x speedup across diverse matrix shapes.</description>

      <title>MVP-ORAM: a Wait-free Concurrent ORAM for Confidential BFT Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that encryption alone is not enough to protect data privacy. Access patterns, revealed when operations are performed, can also be leveraged in inference attacks. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) hides access patterns by making client requests oblivious. However, existing protocols are still limited in supporting concurrent clients and Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). We present MVP-ORAM, the first wait-free ORAM protocol that supports concurrent fail-prone clients. In contrast to previous works, MVP-ORAM avoids using trusted proxies, which require additional security assumptions, and concurrency control mechanisms based on inter-client communication or distributed locks, which limit overall throughput and the capability of tolerating faulty clients. Instead, MVP-ORAM enables clients to perform concurrent requests and merge conflicting updates as they happen, satisfying wait-freedom, i.e., clients make progress independently of the performance or failures of other clients. Since wait and collision freedom are fundamentally contradictory goals that cannot be achieved simultaneously in an asynchronous concurrent ORAM service, we define a weaker notion of obliviousness that depends on the application workload and number of concurrent clients, and prove MVP-ORAM is secure in practical scenarios where clients perform skewed block accesses. By being wait-free, MVP-ORAM can be seamlessly integrated into existing confidential BFT data stores, creating the first BFT ORAM construction. We implement MVP-ORAM on top of a confidential BFT data store and show our prototype can process hundreds of 4KB accesses per second in modern clouds.</description>

      <title>TreeVQA: A Tree-Structured Execution Framework for Shot Reduction in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising for near- and intermediate-term quantum computing, but their execution cost is substantial. Each task requires many iterations and numerous circuits per iteration, and real-world applications often involve multiple tasks, scaling with the precision needed to explore the application's energy landscape. This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications. Evaluations on scientific and combinatorial benchmarks show shot count reductions of $25.9\times$ on average and over $100\times$ for large-scale problems at the same target accuracy. The benefits grow further with increasing problem size and precision requirements.</description>

      <title>Beyond right or wrong : towards redefining adaptive learning indicators in virtual learning environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Student learning development must involve more than just correcting or incorrect questions. However, most adaptive learning methods in Virtual Learning Environments are based on whether the student's response is incorrect or correct. This perspective is limited in assessing the student's learning level, as it does not consider other elements that can be crucial in this process. The objective of this work is to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to elucidate which learning indicators influence student learning and which can be implemented in a VLE to assist in adaptive learning. The works selected and filtered by qualitative assessment reveal a comprehensive approach to assessing different aspects of the learning in virtual environments, such as motivation, emotions, physiological responses, brain imaging, and the students' prior knowledge. The discussion of these new indicators allows adaptive technology developers to implement more appropriate solutions to students' realities, resulting in more complete training.</description>

      <title>BOOST: BOttleneck-Optimized Scalable Training Framework for Low-Rank Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scale of transformer model pre-training is constrained by the increasing computation and communication cost. Low-rank bottleneck architectures offer a promising solution to significantly reduce the training time and memory footprint with minimum impact on accuracy. Despite algorithmic efficiency, bottleneck architectures scale poorly under standard tensor parallelism. Simply applying 3D parallelism designed for full-rank methods leads to excessive communication and poor GPU utilization. To address this limitation, we propose BOOST, an efficient training framework tailored for large-scale low-rank bottleneck architectures. BOOST introduces a novel Bottleneck-aware Tensor Parallelism, and combines optimizations such as online-RMSNorm, linear layer grouping, and low-rank activation checkpointing to achieve end-to-end training speedup. Evaluations on different low-rank bottleneck architectures demonstrate that BOOST achieves 1.46-1.91$\times$ speedup over full-rank model baselines and 1.87-2.27$\times$ speedup over low-rank model with naively integrated 3D parallelism, with improved GPU utilization and reduced communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Asynchronous Semantics in Trace-Discovered Resilience Models: A Case Study on the OpenTelemetry Demo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While distributed tracing and chaos engineering are becoming standard for microservices, resilience models remain largely manual and bespoke. We revisit a trace-discovered connectivity model that derives a service dependency graph from traces and uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate endpoint availability under fail-stop service failures. Compared to earlier work, we (i) derive the graph directly from raw OpenTelemetry traces, (ii) attach endpoint-specific success predicates, and (iii) add a simple asynchronous semantics that treats Kafka edges as non-blocking for immediate HTTP success. We apply this model to the OpenTelemetry Demo ("Astronomy Shop") using a GitHub Actions workflow that discovers the graph, runs simulations, and executes chaos experiments that randomly kill microservices in a Docker Compose deployment. Across the studied failure fractions, the model reproduces the overall availability degradation curve, while asynchronous semantics for Kafka edges change predicted availabilities by at most about 10^(-5) (0.001 percentage points). This null result suggests that for immediate HTTP availability in this case study, explicitly modeling asynchronous dependencies is not warranted, and a simpler connectivity-only model is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Spectral Sentinel: Scalable Byzantine-Robust Decentralized Federated Learning via Sketched Random Matrix Theory on Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training without centralized trust, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine clients that poison gradients under heterogeneous (Non-IID) data. Existing defenses face a scalability trilemma: distance-based filtering (e.g., Krum) can reject legitimate Non-IID updates, geometric-median methods incur prohibitive $O(n^2 d)$ cost, and many certified defenses are evaluated only on models below 100M parameters. We propose Spectral Sentinel, a Byzantine detection and aggregation framework that leverages a random-matrix-theoretic signature: honest Non-IID gradients produce covariance eigenspectra whose bulk follows the Marchenko-Pastur law, while Byzantine perturbations induce detectable tail anomalies. Our algorithm combines Frequent Directions sketching with data-dependent MP tracking, enabling detection on models up to 1.5B parameters using $O(k^2)$ memory with $k \ll d$. Under a $(\sigma,f)$ threat model with coordinate-wise honest variance bounded by $\sigma^2$ and $f &lt; 1/2$ adversaries, we prove $(\epsilon,\delta)$-Byzantine resilience with convergence rate $O(\sigma f / \sqrt{T} + f^2 / T)$, and we provide a matching information-theoretic lower bound $\Omega(\sigma f / \sqrt{T})$, establishing minimax optimality. We implement the full system with blockchain integration on Polygon networks and validate it across 144 attack-aggregator configurations, achieving 78.4 percent average accuracy versus 48-63 percent for baseline methods.</description>

      <title>SPARK: Igniting Communication-Efficient Decentralized Learning via Stage-wise Projected NTK and Accelerated Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) faces critical challenges from statistical heterogeneity and communication overhead. While NTK-based methods achieve faster convergence, transmitting full Jacobian matrices is impractical for bandwidth-constrained edge networks. We propose SPARK, synergistically integrating random projection-based Jacobian compression, stage-wise annealed distillation, and Nesterov momentum acceleration. Random projections compress Jacobians while preserving spectral properties essential for convergence. Stage-wise annealed distillation transitions from pure NTK evolution to neighbor-regularized learning, counteracting compression noise. Nesterov momentum accelerates convergence through stable accumulation enabled by distillation smoothing. SPARK achieves 98.7% communication reduction compared to NTK-DFL while maintaining convergence speed and superior accuracy. With momentum, SPARK reaches target performance 3 times faster, establishing state-of-the-art results for communication-efficient decentralized learning and enabling practical deployment in bandwidth-limited edge environments.</description>

      <title>Towards Secure Decentralized Applications and Consensus Protocols in Blockchains (on Selfish Mining, Undercutting Attacks, DAG-Based Blockchains, E-Voting, Cryptocurrency Wallets, Secure-Logging, and CBDC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of cryptocurrencies, many new applications built on decentralized blockchains have emerged. Blockchains are full-stack distributed systems where multiple sub-systems interact. While many deployed blockchains and decentralized applications need better scalability and performance, security is also critical. Due to their complexity, assessing blockchain and DAPP security requires a more holistic view than for traditional distributed or centralized systems.
  In this thesis, we summarize our contributions to blockchain and decentralized application security. We propose a security reference architecture to support standardized vulnerability and threat analysis. We study consensus security in single-chain Proof-of-Work blockchains, including resistance to selfish mining, undercutting, and greedy transaction selection, as well as related issues in DAG-based systems. We contribute to wallet security with a new classification of authentication schemes and a two-factor method based on One-Time Passwords. We advance e-voting with a practical boardroom voting protocol, extend it to a scalable version for millions of participants while preserving security and privacy, and introduce a repetitive voting framework that enables vote changes between elections while avoiding peak-end effects. Finally, we improve secure logging using blockchains and trusted computing through a centralized ledger that guarantees non-equivocation, integrity, and censorship evidence, then build on it to propose an interoperability protocol for central bank digital currencies that ensures atomic transfers.</description>

      <title>SEDULity: A Proof-of-Learning Framework for Distributed and Secure Blockchains with Efficient Useful Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The security and decentralization of Proof-of-Work (PoW) have been well-tested in existing blockchain systems. However, its tremendous energy waste has raised concerns about sustainability. Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) aims to redirect the meaningless computation to meaningful tasks such as solving machine learning (ML) problems, giving rise to the branch of Proof-of-Learning (PoL). While previous studies have proposed various PoLs, they all, to some degree, suffer from security, decentralization, or efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a PoL framework that trains ML models efficiently while maintaining blockchain security in a fully distributed manner. We name the framework SEDULity, which stands for a Secure, Efficient, Distributed, and Useful Learning-based blockchain system. Specifically, we encode the template block into the training process and design a useful function that is difficult to solve but relatively easy to verify, as a substitute for the PoW puzzle. We show that our framework is distributed, secure, and efficiently trains ML models. We further demonstrate that the proposed PoL framework can be extended to other types of useful work and design an incentive mechanism to incentivize task verification. We show theoretically that a rational miner is incentivized to train fully honestly with well-designed system parameters. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our framework and validate our analysis.</description>

      <title>SPIDER: Unleashing Sparse Tensor Cores for Stencil Computation via Strided Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on accelerating stencil computations by exploiting emerging hardware like Tensor Cores. To leverage these accelerators, the stencil operation must be transformed to matrix multiplications. However, this transformation introduces undesired sparsity into the kernel matrix, leading to significant redundant computation.
  In this paper, we present SPIDER, the first system to turn this unresolved sparsity into an optimization opportunity by exploring the potential of Sparse Tensor Cores (SpTCs) for stencil acceleration. Specifically, SPIDER introduces an efficient and elegant transformation method that integrates two cooperative techniques: an ahead-of-time strided swapping transformation for kernel matrices and an on-the-fly row-swapping mechanism for inputs. This rule-based approach effectively transforms stencil computation into operations compatible with SpTCs, introducing only slight compile-time overhead and zero runtime overhead. Additionally, SPIDER incorporates multiple optimizations to maximize computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SPIDER outperforms vendor library cuDNN by 6.20$\times$ and state-of-the-art (SOTA) Tensor Core-based approaches (ConvStencil, FlashFFTStencil, etc.) by 2.00$\times$ on average.</description>

      <title>Towards Resource-Efficient Serverless LLM Inference with SLINFER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of LLMs has driven demand for private serverless deployments, characterized by moderate-sized models and infrequent requests. While existing serverless solutions follow exclusive GPU allocation, we take a step back to explore modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously.
  We propose SLINFER, a resource-efficient serverless inference scheme tailored for small- to mid-sized LLMs that enables elastic and on-demand sharing across heterogeneous hardware. SLINFER tackles three fundamental challenges: (1) precise, fine-grained compute resource allocation at token-level to handle fluctuating computational demands; (2) a coordinated and forward-looking memory scaling mechanism to detect out-of-memory hazards and reduce operational overhead; and (3) a dual approach that consolidates fragmented instances through proactive preemption and reactive bin-packing. Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that SLINFER improves serving capacity by 47% - 62% through sharing, while further leveraging CPUs boosts this to 86% - 154%.</description>

      <title>cMPI: Using CXL Memory Sharing for MPI One-Sided and Two-Sided Inter-Node Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a foundational programming model for high-performance computing. MPI libraries traditionally employ network interconnects (e.g., Ethernet and InfiniBand) and network protocols (e.g., TCP and RoCE) with complex software stacks for cross-node communication. We present cMPI, the first work to optimize MPI point-to-point communication (both one-sided and two-sided) using CXL memory sharing on a real CXL platform, transforming cross-node communication into memory transactions and data copies within CXL memory, bypassing traditional network protocols. We analyze performance across various interconnects and find that CXL memory sharing achieves 7.2x-8.1x lower latency than TCP-based interconnects deployed in small- and medium-scale clusters. We address challenges of CXL memory sharing for MPI communication, including data object management over the dax representation [50], cache coherence, and atomic operations. Overall, cMPI outperforms TCP over standard Ethernet NIC and high-end SmartNIC by up to 49x and 72x in latency and bandwidth, respectively, for small messages.</description>

      <title>GoodSpeed: Optimizing Fair Goodput with Adaptive Speculative Decoding in Distributed Edge Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their high computational demands pose significant challenges for real-time inference, especially in multi-user server speculative decoding and resource-constrained environments. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate LLM inference by using lightweight draft models to generate candidate tokens, which are subsequently verified by a larger, more accurate model. However, ensuring both high goodput (the effective rate of accepted tokens) and fairness across multiple draft servers cooperating with a central verification server remains an open challenge. This paper introduces GOODSPEED, a novel distributed inference framework that optimizes goodput through adaptive speculative decoding. GOODSPEED employs a central verification server that coordinates a set of heterogeneous draft servers, each running a small language model to generate speculative tokens. To manage resource allocation effectively, GOODSPEED incorporates a gradient scheduling algorithm that dynamically assigns token verification tasks, maximizing a logarithmic utility function to ensure proportional fairness across servers. By processing speculative outputs from all draft servers in parallel, the framework enables efficient collaboration between the verification server and distributed draft generators, streamlining both latency and throughput. Through rigorous fluid sample path analysis, we show that GOODSPEED converges to the optimal goodput allocation in steady-state conditions and maintains near-optimal performance with provably bounded error under dynamic workloads. These results demonstrate that GOODSPEED provides a scalable, fair and efficient solution for multi-server speculative decoding in distributed LLM inference systems.</description>

      <title>RollMux: Phase-Level Multiplexing for Disaggregated RL Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.</description>

      <title>LEGO: A Layout Expression Language for Code Generation of Hierarchical Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe LEGO, a new approach to optimizing data movement whereby code is expressed as a layout-independent computation and composed with layouts for data and computation. This code generator organization derives complex indexing expressions associated with hierarchical parallel code and data movement for GPUs. LEGO maps from layout specification to indexing expressions, and can be integrated into existing compilers and code templates. It facilitates the exploration of data layouts in combination with other optimizations. We demonstrate LEGO's integration with the Triton and MLIR compilers, and with CUDA templates. We show that LEGO is capable of deriving performance competitive with Triton, and shows broad applicability for data and thread layout mapping optimizations in its integration with CUDA and MLIR.</description>
