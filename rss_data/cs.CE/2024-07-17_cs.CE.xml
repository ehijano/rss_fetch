      <title>Modal Decomposition in Numerical Computation of Eddy Current Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A methodology to reduce the computational cost of time domain computations of eddy currents problems is proposed and implemented in a parallel computing environment. It is based on the modal decomposition of the current density and it is applicable even in presence of injected currents into the electrodes of a conducting domain. Using a theta-method integration algorithm, the performances of the the proposed approach are compared against those of a classical method based on the Cholesky factorization, for a case of interest from eddy current nondestructive testing. For this large eddy current problem (number of unknowns greater than 100k, number of time steps of interest equal to 100k) the proposed solution method is shown to be much faster than those based on standard time integration schemes.</description>

      <title>Form-Finding and Physical Property Predictions of Tensegrity Structures Using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the design of tensegrity structures, traditional form-finding methods utilize kinematic and static approaches to identify geometric configurations that achieve equilibrium. However, these methods often fall short when applied to actual physical models due to imperfections in the manufacturing of structural elements, assembly errors, and material non-linearities. In this work, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) approach to predict the geometric configurations and physical properties-such as nodal coordinates, member forces, and natural frequencies-of any tensegrity structures in equilibrium states. First, we outline the analytical governing equations for tensegrity structures, covering statics involving nodal coordinates and member forces, as well as modal information. Next, we propose a data-driven framework for training an appropriate DNN model capable of simultaneously predicting tensegrity forms and physical properties, thereby circumventing the need to solve equilibrium equations. For validation, we analyze three tensegrity structures, including a tensegrity D-bar, prism, and lander, demonstrating that our approach can identify approximation systems with relatively very small output errors. This technique is applicable to a wide range of tensegrity structures, particularly in real-world construction, and can be extended to address additional challenges in identifying structural physics information.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multistep Brent Oil Price Forecasting with a Multi-Aspect Metaheuristic Optimization Approach and Ensemble Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate crude oil price forecasting is crucial for various economic activities, including energy trading, risk management, and investment planning. Although deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for crude oil price forecasting, achieving accurate forecasts remains challenging. Deep learning models' performance is heavily influenced by hyperparameters tuning, and they are expected to perform differently under various circumstances. Furthermore, price volatility is also sensitive to external factors such as world events. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach combining metaheuristic optimisation and an ensemble of five popular neural network architectures used in time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that apply metaheuristics to optimise hyperparameters within the neural network architecture, we exploit the GWO metaheuristic optimiser at four levels: feature selection, data preparation, model training, and forecast blending. The proposed approach has been evaluated for forecasting three-ahead days using real-world Brent crude oil price data, and the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the forecasting performance measured using various benchmarks, achieving 0.000127 of MSE.</description>

      <title>To Trade Or Not To Trade: Cascading Waterfall Round Robin Rebalancing Mechanism for Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have designed an innovative portfolio rebalancing mechanism termed the Cascading Waterfall Round Robin Mechanism. This algorithmic approach recommends an ideal size and number of trades for each asset during the periodic rebalancing process, factoring in the gas fee and slippage. The essence of the model we have created gives indications regarding whether trades should be made on individual assets depending on the uncertainty in the micro - asset level characteristics - and macro - aggregate market factors - environments. In the hyper-volatile crypto market, our approach to daily rebalancing will benefit from volatility. Price movements will cause our algorithm to buy assets that drop in prices and sell as they soar. In fact, the buying and selling happen only when certain boundaries are crossed in order to weed out any market noise and ensure sound trade execution. We have provided several numerical examples to illustrate the steps - including the calculation of several intermediate variables - of our rebalancing mechanism. The Algorithm we have developed can be easily applied outside blockchain to investment funds across all asset classes at any trading frequency and rebalancing duration.
  Shakespeare As A Crypto Trader:
  To Trade Or Not To Trade, that is the Question,
  Whether an Optimizer can Yield the Answer,
  Against the Spikes and Crashes of Markets Gone Wild,
  To Quench One's Thirst before Liquidity Runs Dry,
  Or Wait till the Tide of Momentum turns Mild.</description>

      <title>Base Models for Parabolic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in many disciplines to model the evolution of various mathematical objects, such as probability flows, value functions in control theory, and derivative prices in finance. It is often necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying base distribution. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving PDEs under new parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed-dimensional beam-shell-solid couplings in linear Cosserat continua via tangential differential calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to the coupling of mixed-dimensional continua by employing the mathematically enriched linear Cosserat micropolar model. The kinematical reduction of the model to lower dimensional domains leaves its fundamental degrees of freedom intact. Consequently, the degrees of freedom intrinsically agree even at the interface with a domain of a different dimensionality. Thus, this approach circumvents the need for intermediate finite elements or mortar methods. We introduce the derivations of all models of various dimensions using tangential differential calculus. The coupling itself is then achieved by defining a mixed-dimensional action functional with consistent Sobolev trace operators. Finally, we present numerical examples involving a three-dimensional silicone-rubber block reinforced with a curved graphite shell on its lower surface, a three-dimensional silver block reinforced with a graphite plate and beams, and lastly, intersecting silver shells reinforced with graphite beams.</description>

      <title>A Brief Review of Quantum Machine Learning for Financial Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review paper examines state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques in quantum machine learning with potential applications in finance. We discuss QML techniques in supervised learning tasks, such as Quantum Variational Classifiers, Quantum Kernel Estimation, and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), along with quantum generative AI techniques like Quantum Transformers and Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs). The financial applications considered include risk management, credit scoring, fraud detection, and stock price prediction. We also provide an overview of the challenges, potential, and limitations of QML, both in these specific areas and more broadly across the field. We hope that this can serve as a quick guide for data scientists, professionals in the financial sector, and enthusiasts in this area to understand why quantum computing and QML in particular could be interesting to explore in their field of expertise.</description>
