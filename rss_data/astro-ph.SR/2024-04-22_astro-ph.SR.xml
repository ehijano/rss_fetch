      <title>Evolutionary Period Changes For 52 Cataclysmic Variables, and the Failure For the Most Fundamental Prediction of the Magnetic Braking Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) is driven by period-changes ($\dot{P}$), for which the long-venerable consensus is the Magnetic Braking Model (MBM). The MBM has its only distinctive assumption being a power-law `recipe' describing the angular momentum loss (AML) in the binary, producing a single unique evolutionary track with $\dot{P}$ as a function of the orbital period. This required prediction can be used to test the most-fundamental assumption of MBM, but it has never been tested previously. In this paper, I collect $\dot{P}$ measures for 52 CVs of all types. First, 44 per cent of the CVs have positive-$\dot{P}$, with such being impossible in MBM. Second, even amongst the CVs with negative-$\dot{P}$, their $\dot{P}$ measures are always more-negative than required by MBM, with an average deviation of 110$\times$. Third, three CVs have large chaotic variations in $\dot{P}$ that are impossible for MBM, proving that some unknown mechanism exists and is operating that dominates for these systems. Fourth, the MBM does not account for the long-term effects on evolution arising from the large sudden period decreases seen across many nova events, with this unaccounted effect dominating for the majority of nova systems and changing the sign of the overall evolutionary $\dot{P}$. Fifth, three recurrent novae are observed to suddenly change $\dot{P}$ by an order-of-magnitude across a nova event, with this being impossible in the MBM. In all, the required MBM $\dot{P}$ predictions all fail for my 52 CVs, usually by orders-of-magnitude, so the MBM AML-recipe is wrong by orders-of-magnitude.</description>

      <title>Pinwheel Outflow induced by Stellar Mass Loss in a Coplanar Triple System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a physical framework for interpreting complex circumstellar patterns whorled around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars by investigating stable, coplanar triple systems using hydrodynamic and particle simulations. The introduction of a close tertiary body causes an additional periodic variation in the orbital velocity and trajectory of the AGB star. As a result, the circumstellar outflow builds a fine non-Archimedean spiral pattern superimposed upon the Archimedean spiral produced by the outer binary alone. This fine spiral can be approximated by off-centered circular rings that become tangent to each other at the location of the Archimedean spiral. The superimposed fine pattern fades out relatively quickly as a function of distance from the center of the system, in contrast to the dominant Archimedean spiral pattern, which presents a much slower fractional density decrease with radius. The different rates of radial decrease of the density contrast in the two superimposed patterns, coupled with their different time and spatial scales, lead to an apparent, but illusory radial change in the observed pattern interval, as has been reported, for example, in CW Leo. The function describing the detailed radial dependence of the expansion velocity is different in the two patterns, which may be used to distinguish them. The shape of the circumstellar whorled pattern is further explored as a function of the orbital eccentricity and the inner companion's mass. Although this study is confined to stable, coplanar triple systems, the results are likely applicable to moderately noncoplanar systems and open interesting avenues for studying noncoplanar systems.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy glitches in pulsating stars revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharp structural variations induce specific signatures on stellar pulsations that can be studied to infer localised information on the stratification of the star. This information is key to improve our understanding of the physical processes that lead to the structural variations and how to model them. Here we revisit and extend the analysis of the signature of different types of buoyancy glitches in gravity-mode and mixed-mode pulsators presented in earlier works, including glitches with step-like, Gaussian-like, and Dirac-$\delta$-like shapes. In particular, we provide analytical expressions for the perturbations to the periods and show that these can be reliably used in place of the expressions provided for the period spacings, with the advantage that the use of the new expressions does not require modes with consecutive radial orders to be observed. Based on a comparison with two limit cases and on simulated data, we further tested the accuracy of the expression for the Gaussian-like glitch signature whose derivation in an earlier work involved a significant approximation. We find that the least reliable glitch parameter inferred from fitting that expression is the amplitude, which can be up to a factor of two larger than the true amplitude, reaching this limit when the glitch is small. We further discuss the impact on the glitch signature of considering a glitch in the inner and outer half of the g-mode cavity, emphasising the break of symmetry that takes place in the case of mixed-mode pulsators.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-0845L: A low-mass M dwarf from the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0845, which was affected by both the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects. The former was detected via the simultaneous observations from the ground and Spitzer, and the latter was caused by the orbital motion of the source star in a relatively close binary. The combination of these two effects led to a direct mass measurement of the lens object, revealing a low-mass ($0.14 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$) M-dwarf at the bulge distance ($7.6 \pm 1.0$ kpc). The source binary consists of a late F-type subgiant and a K-type dwarf of $\sim1.2 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 0.9 M_{\odot}$, respectively, and the orbital period is $70 \pm 10$ days. OGLE-2015-BLG-0845 is the first single-lens event in which the lens mass is measured via the binarity of the source. Given the abundance of binary systems as potential microlensing sources, the xallarap effect may not be a rare phenomenon. Our work thus highlights the application of the xallarap effect in the mass determination of microlenses, and the same method can be used to identify isolated dark lenses.</description>

      <title>Formation of a $33\,M_{\odot}$ black hole in a low-metallicity binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $33\,M_\odot$ black hole (BH) was recently discovered in an 11.6-year binary only 590 pc from the Sun. The system, Gaia BH3, contains a $0.8\,M_\odot$ low-metallicity giant ($\rm [M/H]=-2.2$) and is kinematically part of the Galactic halo, suggesting that the BH formed from a low-metallicity massive star. I show that orbits similar to that of Gaia BH3 are naturally produced through isolated binary evolution. The system's period and eccentricity can result from a broad range of initial orbits with a modest natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 75\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) to the BH. I construct MESA models for metal-poor massive stars with initial masses ranging from $35-55\,M_{\odot}$, which reach maximum radii of $1150-1800\,R_{\odot}$ as red supergiants. Stars of this size would fit inside most plausible pre-supernova orbits for the system without overflowing their Roche lobes. In addition, models with moderately rapid initial rotation ($\Omega/\Omega_{\rm crit} \gtrsim 0.45$) undergo chemically homogeneous evolution and never expand to radii larger than $10\,R_{\odot}$. There are thus multiple channels through which a low-metallicity, extreme-mass ratio binary could produce a system like Gaia BH3. Dynamical formation scenarios are also viable, and there is little doubt that both isolated and dynamically-formed BH binaries with orbits similar to Gaia BH3 will be discovered in Gaia DR4. Only about 1 in 10,000 stars in the solar neighborhood have metallicities as low as Gaia BH3. This suggests that BH companions are dramatically over-represented at low-metallicity, though caveats related to small number statistics apply. The fact that the luminous star in Gaia BH3 has been a giant - greatly boosting its detectability - only for $\sim$1% of the time since the system's formation implies that additional massive BHs remain to be discovered with only moderately fainter companions.</description>

      <title>Unequal-mass, highly-spinning binary black hole mergers in the stable mass transfer formation channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing database of gravitational-wave (GW) detections with the binary black holes (BHs) merging in the distant Universe contains subtle insights into their formation scenarios. One of the puzzling properties of detected GW sources is the possible (anti)correlation between mass ratio q of BH-BH binaries and their effective spin. We use rapid binary evolution models to demonstrate that the isolated binary evolution followed by efficient tidal spin-up of stripped helium core produces a similar pattern in Xeff vs q distributions of BH-BH mergers. In our models, the progenitors of unequal BH-BH systems in the stable mass transfer formation scenario are more likely to efficiently shrink their orbits during the second Roche-lobe overflow than the binaries that evolve into nearly equal-mass component systems. This makes it easier for unequal-mass progenitors to enter the tidal spin-up regime and later merge due to GW emission. Our results are, however, sensitive to some input assumptions, especially, the stability of mass transfer and the angular momentum loss during non-conservative mass transfer. We note that mass transfer prescriptions widely adopted in rapid codes favor the formation of BH-BH merger progenitors with unequal masses and moderate separations. We compare our results with detailed stellar model grids and find reasonable agreement after appropriate calibration of the physics models. We anticipate that future detections of unequal-mass BH-BH mergers could provide valuable constraints on the role of the stable mass transfer formation channel. A significant fraction of BH-BH detections with mass ratio q in range (0.4 - 0.7) would be consistent with the mass ratio reversal scenario during the first, relatively conservative mass transfer, and a non-enhanced angular momentum loss during the second, highly non-conservative mass transfer phase.</description>

      <title>The longevity of the oldest open clusters: Structural parameters of NGC 188, NGC 2420, NGC 2425, NGC 2682, NGC 6791, NGC 6819</title>

Abstract: Context: Open clusters' dynamical evolution is driven by stellar evolution, internal dynamics and external forces, which according to dynamical simulations, will evaporate them in a timescale of about 1 Ga. However, about 10\% of the known open clusters are older. They are special systems whose detailed properties are related to their dynamical evolution and the balance between mechanisms of cluster formation and dissolution. Aims:We investigate the spatial distribution and structural parameters of six open clusters older than 1 Ga in order to constrain their dynamical evolution, and longevity.} Methods: We identify members using Gaia EDR3 data up to a distance of 150 pc from each cluster's centre. We investigate the spatial distribution of stars inside each cluster to understand their degree of mass segregation. Finally, in order to interpret the obtained radial density profiles we reproduced them using the lowered isothermal model explorer with PYTHON Limepy and spherical potential escapers stitched SPES. Results: All the studied clusters seem more extended than previously reported in the literature. The spatial distributions of three of them show some structures aligned with their orbits. They may be related to the existence of extra tidal stars. In fact, we find that about 20 % of their members have enough energy to leave the systems or are already unbound. Together with their initial masses, their distances to the Galactic plane may play significant roles in their survival. We found clear evidences that the most dynamically evolved clusters do not fill their Roche volumes, appearing more concentrated than the others. Finally, we find a cusp-core dichotomy in the central regions of the studied clusters, which shows some similarities to the one observed among globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formation of Gaia BH3 in the progenitor globular cluster of the ED-2 stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The star-black hole (S-BH) binary discovered by the Gaia Collaboration - Gaia BH3 - is chemically and kinematically associated with the metal-poor ED-2 stream in the Milky Way halo.
  Aims. We explore the possibility that Gaia BH3 was assembled dynamically in the progenitor globular cluster (GC) of the ED-2 stream.
  Methods. We use a public suite of star-by-star dynamical Monte Carlo models by Kremer et al. (2020) to identify S-BH binaries in GCs with different initial masses and (half-mass) radii.
  Results. We show that a likely progenitor of the ED-2 stream was a relatively low-mass ($\lesssim10^5M_\odot$) GC with an initial half-mass radius of 2 - 4 pc. Such a GC can dynamically retain a large fraction of its BH population and dissolve on the orbit of ED-2. From the suite of models we find that GCs produce ~ 3 - 30 S-BH binaries, approximately independent of initial GC mass and inversely correlated with initial cluster radius. Scaling the results to the Milky Way GC population, we find that ~$75\%$ of the S-BH binaries formed in GCs are ejected from their host GC in the early phases of evolution ($\lesssim1$ Gyr); these are expected to no longer be close to the stream. The ~25\% of S-BH binaries retained until dissolution are expected to form part of streams, such that for an initial mass of the progenitor of ED-2 of a few $10^4M_\odot$, we expect ~2-3 S-BH to end up in the stream. GC models with metallicities similar to Gaia BH3 ($\lesssim1\%$ solar) include S-BH binaries with similar BH masses ($\gtrsim30M_\odot$), orbital periods, and eccentricities.
  Conclusions. We predict the Galactic halo contains of order $10^5$ S-BH binaries that formed dynamically in GCs, a fraction of which may readily be detected in Gaia DR4. The detection of these sources provides valuable tests of BH dynamics in clusters and the possible role in formation of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Tearing-mediated reconnection in magnetohydrodynamic poorly ionized plasmas. I. Onset and linear evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-Lundquist-number plasmas, reconnection proceeds via onset of tearing, followed by a nonlinear phase during which plasmoids continuously form, merge, and are ejected from the current sheet (CS). This process is understood in fully ionized, magnetohydrodynamic plasmas. However, many plasma environments, such as star-forming molecular clouds and the solar chromosphere, are poorly ionized. We use theory and computation to study tearing-mediated reconnection in such poorly ionized systems. In this paper, we focus on the onset and linear evolution of this process. In poorly ionized plasmas, magnetic nulls on scales below $v_{\rm A,n0}/\nu_{\rm ni0}$, with $v_{\rm A,n0}$ the neutral Alfv\'{e}n speed and $\nu_{\rm ni0}$ the neutral-ion collision frequency, will self-sharpen via ambipolar diffusion. This sharpening occurs at an increasing rate, inhibiting the onset of reconnection. Once the CS becomes thin enough, however, ions decouple from neutrals and thinning of the CS slows, allowing tearing to onset in a time of order $\nu_{\rm ni0}^{-1}$. We find that the wavelength and growth rate of the mode that first disrupts the forming sheet can be predicted from a poorly ionized tearing dispersion relation; as the plasma recombination rate increases and ionization fraction decreases, the growth rate becomes an increasing multiple of $\nu_{ni0}$ and the wavelength becomes a decreasing fraction of $v_{\rm A,n0}/\nu_{\rm ni0}$.</description>

Abstract: Over the past 4 decades, the exploration of planets beyond our solar system has yielded the discovery of over 5600 exoplanets orbiting different stars. Continuous advancements in instrumentation and cutting-edge techniques empower astronomers to unveil and characterize new exoworlds with increasing frequency. Notably, direct imaging, also called high-contrast imaging (HCI), stands out as the only method capable of capturing photons emitted directly from the planetary bodies. This innovative technique proves particularly advantageous for scrutinizing nascent planetary systems, where planets shine brilliantly and emit significant heat during their initial developmental phases. HCI provides comprehensive visuals of the entire system, encompassing the central star, potential circumstellar disks, and any additional companions. However, the complexity of imaging an object 10^6 fainter than its parent star necessitates state-of-the-art instrumentation. HCI demands cutting-edge tools such as exAO systems, telescopes exceeding 8 meters in diameter, coronagraphs, and modern imagers. The pivotal role of post-processing cannot be overstated in the quest for detecting and characterizing planets through HCI. This method has not only facilitated the discovery of numerous planets but has also presented invaluable opportunities to explore the properties of young substellar companions, both planets and brown dwarfs. Insights into their interactions with parent disks or other companions within the system, the composition of their atmospheres, and the identification of still accreting planets, also known as "protoplanets," contribute significantly to our understanding of planet formation scenarios. The continued refinement of HCI promises to unveil further revelations in the captivating field of exoplanetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a dormant 33 solar-mass black hole in pre-release Gaia astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from black-hole merging events have revealed a population of extra-galactic BHs residing in short-period binaries with masses that are higher than expected based on most stellar evolution models - and also higher than known stellar-origin black holes in our Galaxy. It has been proposed that those high-mass BHs are the remnants of massive metal-poor stars. Gaia astrometry is expected to uncover many Galactic wide-binary systems containing dormant BHs, which may not have been detected before. The study of this population will provide new information on the BH-mass distribution in binaries and shed light on their formation mechanisms and progenitors. As part of the validation efforts in preparation for the fourth Gaia data release (DR4), we analysed the preliminary astrometric binary solutions, obtained by the Gaia Non-Single Star pipeline, to verify their significance and to minimise false-detection rates in high-mass-function orbital solutions. The astrometric binary solution of one source, Gaia BH3, implies the presence of a 32.70 \pm 0.82 M\odot BH in a binary system with a period of 11.6 yr. Gaia radial velocities independently validate the astrometric orbit. Broad-band photometric and spectroscopic data show that the visible component is an old, very metal-poor giant of the Galactic halo, at a distance of 590 pc. The BH in the Gaia BH3 system is more massive than any other Galactic stellar-origin BH known thus far. The low metallicity of the star companion supports the scenario that metal-poor massive stars are progenitors of the high-mass BHs detected by gravitational-wave telescopes. The Galactic orbit of the system and its metallicity indicate that it might belong to the Sequoia halo substructure. Alternatively, and more plausibly, it could belong to the ED-2 stream, which likely originated from a globular cluster that had been disrupted by the Milky Way.</description>
