      <title>Layer-Wise Anomaly Detection in Directed Energy Deposition using High-Fidelity Fringe Projection Profilometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations, lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated, annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Universality of physical neural networks with multivariate nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enormous energy demand of artificial intelligence is driving the development of alternative hardware for deep learning. Physical neural networks try to exploit physical systems to perform machine learning more efficiently. In particular, optical systems can calculate with light using negligible energy. While their computational capabilities were long limited by the linearity of optical materials, nonlinear computations have recently been demonstrated through modified input encoding. Despite this breakthrough, our inability to determine if physical neural networks can learn arbitrary relationships between data -- a key requirement for deep learning known as universality -- hinders further progress. Here we present a fundamental theorem that establishes a universality condition for physical neural networks. It provides a powerful mathematical criterion that imposes device constraints, detailing how inputs should be encoded in the tunable parameters of the physical system. Based on this result, we propose a scalable architecture using free-space optics that is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on image classification tasks. Further, by combining the theorem with temporal multiplexing, we present a route to potentially huge effective system sizes in highly practical but poorly scalable on-chip photonic devices. Our theorem and scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of a wide class of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying further efforts in their development.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Origin of Surface Peregrine Soliton and Its Topological Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of dynamic wave localization phenomena manifest underlying intricate physical effects in the diverse areas of physics, and in particular, in optics and photonics, which often bear signatures of implicit nontrivial wave structures. A Peregrine soliton that has a complex wave structure draws particular interest in nonlinear wave optics because of its space-time localization and prototypical analogy of the extreme form of wave localization. In the PT variant of the standard NLSE, we show nontrivial wave coupling of the initial excitations, giving rise to intriguing complex wave interaction in the unbroken and broken regimes of PT symmetry at an optical interface of a composite complex optical system. In particular, a surface Peregrine soliton mode is found to exist at the interface between two optical media characterized by distinct nonlinear and dispersive properties. Remarkably, it yields stable wave propagation in the unbroken PT regime despite discontinuities in the optical properties, and enhanced surface wave localization in the broken PT phase. We show that such a surface mode emanates from the interplay between the non-Hermitian pseudo-self-induced PT potential and a nonlinearity-dispersion engineering scheme of the composite optical system which, in effect, forms a non-Hermitian topological domain wall at the interface between two distinct optical media. The topological signatures of the surface Peregrine soliton mode are discussed. This work sheds light on the wave localization in the non-Hermitian optical wave systems in general, and illustrates, in particular, for the first time, the existence of a surface Peregrine soliton mode at the cross-field synergistic point of nonlinear optics, non-Hermitian physics, and topological wave phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-illumination multiplexed Fourier ptychographic microscopy with robust aberration correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a powerful computational imaging modality that achieves high space-bandwidth product imaging for biomedical samples. However, its adoption is limited by slow data acquisition due to the need for sequential measurements. Multiplexed FPM strategies have been proposed to accelerate imaging by activating multiple LEDs simultaneously, but they typically require careful parameter tuning, and their lack of effective aberration correction makes them prone to image degradation. To address these limitations, we introduce hybrid-illumination multiplexed Fourier ptychographic microscopy (HMFPM), which integrates analytic aberration extraction capability with the efficiency of multiplexed illumination. Specifically, HMFPM employs a hybrid illumination strategy and a customized reconstruction algorithm with analytic and optimization methods. This hybrid strategy substantially reduces the number of required measurements while ensuring robust aberration correction and stable convergence. We demonstrate that HMFPM achieves 1.08 micrometers resolution, representing a 4-fold enhancement over the system's coherent diffraction limit, across a 1.77x1.77 millimeter square field of view using 20 measurements. HMFPM remains robust under diverse aberrations, providing up to 84 micrometers digital refocusing capability, and effectively corrects both field-dependent and scanning-induced aberrations in whole-slide pathology imaging. These results establish HMFPM as a practical, high-throughput, and aberration-free solution for biological and biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Metapinhole: Planar Fourier Optics Without Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 4f lens system is a standard Fourier-optics building block for angular control in optical platforms such as spatial light modulators, imaging systems, and data storage devices. This work presents the first nanoscale implementation of an equivalent system, achieving a five-orders-of-magnitude footprint reduction. By engineering the angular scattering response of metagratings, sharp-edge spatial filtering is realized through the interplay of angle-dependent two-dimensional dipolar resonances, Rayleigh anomalies, and Kerker-like dipolar cancellation. The metagrating functions as a high-efficiency low-pass and a controllable high-pass angular filter in transmission. In addition, diffraction-controllable angular invariance across the entire spatial Fourier space enables tunable band-pass filtering in reflection. This lens-free approach provides a compact, alignment-insensitive solution for spatial filtering in electromagnetic regimes where conventional lenses or pinholes are impractical or costly -such as the terahertz or infrared ranges- and facilitates spatial filtering for movable beams without complex mechanical adjustments. It also enables unprecedented single-shot multiplexing of diverse spatial filtering functions at distinct central wavelengths, and extends spatial filtering to signals with extremely low coherence lengths.</description>

      <title>Data Driven Drift Correction For Complex Optical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To exploit the thousand-fold increase in spectral brightness of modern light sources, increasingly intricate experiments are being conducted that demand extremely precise beam trajectory. Maintaining the optimal trajectory over several hours of an experiment with the needed precision necessitates active drift control. Here, we outline Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization (TVBO) as a data driven approach for robust drift correction, and illustrate its application for a split and delay optical system composed of six crystals and twelve input dimensions. Using numerical simulations, we exhibit the application of TVBO for linear drift, non-smooth temporal drift as well as constrained TVBO for multi-objective control settings, representing real-life operating conditions. This approach can be easily adapted to other X-ray beam conditioning and guidance systems, including multi-crystal monochromators and grazing-incidence mirrors, to maintain sub-micron and nanoradian beam stability over the course of an experiment spanning several hours.</description>

      <title>Polarization memory effect in a multimode fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical memory effects are well-known types of amplitude-domain wave correlation enabling control over light scattered through diffusive materials or multimode fibers. In this letter, we report the phenomenon of random polarization memory effect. We observe that, despite strong scattering, which leads to random spatial polarization distributions at the multimode fiber output, local polarization states of the optical field maintain a high degree of correlation with respect to the input polarization state. This newly observed effect reveals an additional layer of deterministic behavior in light propagation through multimode fibers and opens up new opportunities for imaging and sensing.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Topological Valley-Hall States in Photonic Crystals for Robust Cancer Cell Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonic crystals (TPhCs) are the photonic analogs of topological insulators, inspired by the quantum Hall effect and its variants, including the integer, spin, and valley Hall effects. Among these, valley-hall photonic crystals (VPhCs) achieve topological protection by breaking inversion symmetry, making them closely related to valleytronics. Like other TPhCs, VPhCs enable robust, backscattering-free light propagation, even in the presence of structural imperfections, sharp bends, or defects. In this study, we introduce a VPhC design that demonstrates exceptional resilience in guiding light through both linear and \(\Omega\)-shaped waveguides, even under significant structural disorder. Additionally, efficient light confinement is demonstrated within a hexagonal resonant cavity, further underscoring the versatility of the platform. On this basis, a VPhC-based biosensor is proposed, designed to achieve high sensitivity and a strong quality factor, thereby enabling carcinoma cell detection. The work demonstrates that the sensor achieves a maximum quality factor of 285,338 and a maximum sensitivity of 24,300 nm/RIU. This work holds significant promise for advancing medical and clinical diagnostics, paving the way for innovative applications in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Topological robustness of classical and quantum optical skyrmions in atmospheric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degradation of classical and quantum structured light induced by complex media constitutes a critical barrier to its practical implementation in a range of applications, from communication and energy transport to imaging and sensing. Atmospheric turbulence is an exemplary case due to its complex phase structure and dynamic variations, driving the need to find invariances in light. Here we construct classical and quantum optical skyrmions and pass them through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence, revealing the embedded topological resilience of their structure. In the quantum realm, we show that while skyrmions undergo diminished entanglement, their topological characteristics maintain stable. This is paralleled classically, where the vectorial structure is scrambled by the medium yet the skyrmion remains stable by virtue of its intrinsic topological protection mechanism. Our experimental results are supported by rigorous analytical and numerical modelling, validating that the quantum-classical equivalence of the topological behaviour is due to the non-separability of the states and one-sided nature of the channel. Our work blurs the classical-quantum divide in the context of topology and opens a new path to information resilience in noisy channels, such as terrestrial and satellite-to-ground communication networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally show an electro-optic tunable Fabry-Perot cavity on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Instead of tuning the cavity phase and thus resonant frequency, we demonstrate modulation of the FP cavity by tuning the cavity mirrors via the electro-optic effect in the couplers. We enable full tuning of a low-Q FP cavity with only 3.5 V Vpi and a very short 3.5 mm long Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) mirror.</description>

      <title>Structuring Polarization States of Light in Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatiotemporal sculpturing of light beams with arbitrary phase and polarization topologies has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to advance optical technologies and reveal novel physical phenomena. Examples of spatiotemporal beams include space-time wave packets, flying donuts, tilted pulse fronts, X-waves, Airy pulses, and spatiotemporal optical vortices. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a new class of spatiotemporal polarization states of light. We propose a generalized spatiotemporal higher-order Poincar\'e sphere and show that these polarization states emerge from the superposition of two orthogonal circular polarization states, each carrying a spatiotemporal optical vortex. Such a choice of the basis enables simultaneous control of the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom of light. Theoretical predictions are experimentally validated using ultrafast femtosecond pulses, revealing how the resulting polarization distributions evolve in both space and time. Finally, we further extend this approach to construct a family of spatiotemporal skyrmionic textures that are localized, topologically nontrivial configurations of the electromagnetic field vector, offering a versatile framework for generating and controlling multidimensional (space and time) structured polarization fields. The ability to create and manipulate diverse forms of spatiotemporal skyrmionic textures opens up new opportunities for studying complex light-matter interaction phenomena, advanced imaging and micromanipulation, and encoding information across both space and time, with potential implications for advanced optical communication and information processing in classical and quantum domains</description>

      <title>Exploiting Phase Light Modulators for Low-SWaP Real-time Wavefront Correction at High-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront correction and beam tracking are critical in applications such as long-range imaging through turbulence and free-space optical communication. For instance, adaptive optics systems are employed to correct wavefront distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence and optical misalignments, while beam tracking systems maintain alignment between separate devices in free-space communication scenarios. Current state-of-the-art approaches offer several high-performance solutions, each tailored to specific correction tasks. However, integrating all these functionalities into a single device, e.g., for simultaneous adaptive wavefront correction and tracking, can significantly increase the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) of the final system. In this contribution, we demonstrate the use of the Texas Instruments Phase Light Modulator (PLM) as a low-SWaP, chip-scale solution for simultaneous wavefront correction and beam tracking in real-time, featuring over one million actuators. In particular, we will present and discuss multiple algorithms and optimization strategies that we have specifically developed for PLM-based wavefront correction.</description>

      <title>Meta-training of diffractive meta-neural networks for super-resolution direction of arrival estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive neural networks leverage the high-dimensional characteristics of electromagnetic (EM) fields for high-throughput computing. However, the existing architectures face challenges in integrating large-scale multidimensional metasurfaces with precise network training and haven't utilized multidimensional EM field coding scheme for super-resolution sensing. Here, we propose diffractive meta-neural networks (DMNNs) for accurate EM field modulation through metasurfaces, which enable multidimensional multiplexing and coding for multi-task learning and high-throughput super-resolution direction of arrival estimation. DMNN integrates pre-trained mini-metanets to characterize the amplitude and phase responses of meta-atoms across different polarizations and frequencies, with structure parameters inversely designed using the gradient-based meta-training. For wide-field super-resolution angle estimation, the system simultaneously resolves azimuthal and elevational angles through x and y-polarization channels, while the interleaving of frequency-multiplexed angular intervals generates spectral-encoded optical super-oscillations to achieve full-angle high-resolution estimation. Post-processing lightweight electronic neural networks further enhance the performance. Experimental results validate that a three-layer DMNN operating at 27 GHz, 29 GHz, and 31 GHz achieves $\sim7\times$ Rayleigh diffraction-limited angular resolution (0.5$^\circ$), a mean absolute error of 0.048$^\circ$ for two incoherent targets within a $\pm 11.5^\circ$ field of view, and an angular estimation throughput an order of magnitude higher (1917) than that of existing methods. The proposed architecture advances high-dimensional photonic computing systems by utilizing inherent high-parallelism and all-optical coding methods for ultra-high-resolution, high-throughput applications.</description>

      <title>A Screen-printed, Silver-nanowire-based Optically Transparent Wideband Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for 5G mmWave Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can help establish secondary line-of-sight links for 5G mmWave and beyond applications to cater for the large path loss and blockage in millimeter-wave direct links. It is desirable that the RISs are optically transparent so that they can be placed on building windows, etc. However, traditional transparent designs with indium tin oxide films have challenges of high loss and low transparency, while metallic meshes suffer from a large feature size for millimeter wave designs. In this letter, we propose an optically transparent RIS using screen-printed silver nanowires (AgNW) and PIN diodes. The AgNW ink has more than 80% optical transparency and a decent conductivity of $5\times10^{6}$ S/m. The RIS array size is 9x20, and each column serially connects 9 unit cells. The RIS can work from 23.5 GHz to 29.5 GHz with 30{\deg} angular stability. The measurement results of the RIS show up to 15 dB gain enhancement within 30{\deg} angle range, while maintaining high optical transparency and large bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Theory and Application of Cavity Solitons in Photonic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven optical cavities containing a nonlinear medium support stable dissipative solitons, cavity solitons, in the form of bright or dark spots of light on a uniformly-lit background. Broadening effects due to diffraction or group velocity dispersion are balanced by the nonlinear interaction with the medium while cavity losses balance the input energy. The history, properties, physical interpretation and wide application of cavity solitons are reviewed. Cavity solitons in the plane perpendicular to light propagation find application in optical information processing, while cavity solitons in the longitudinal direction produce high quality frequency combs with applications in optical communications, frequency standards, optical clocks, future GPS, astronomy and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Unlock giant nonreciprocity via multi-valued behavior of non-Hermitian zero-index materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Einstein's field equations are time-independent, the multivalued feature of the horizon of a blackhole naturally enables the one-way transmission, leading to the strong arrow of time from the time-independent gravitational interaction. Here we experimentally demonstrate a photonic analogue of this principle and reveal the infinite nonreciprocity of the time-reversal-symmetric Maxwell equations. By designing a non-Hermitian zero-index magneto-optical metawaveguide, we introduce multivalued feature to this metawaveguide's complex eigenspace via an exceptional point with non-zero residue, bringing nonlocal, path-dependent historical memory to the system. Hence, a weak magneto-optical response can direct forward and backward waves to two photonic branches with largely distinct momenta and losses, leading to the optical nonreciprocity far beyond the limitation imposed by the magneto-optical material. We fabricated an a-Si/Ce:YIG metawaveguide, achieving nonreciprocal phase shift of 47.78 rad/mm and nonreciprocal loss of 53.9 dB/mm near 1575 nm, exceeding state-of-the-art nonreciprocal devices by an order of magnitude. Our principle universally applies from microwave to visible frequencies, leading to compact isolators, circulators, and sensors. Our principle can also be extended to nonreciprocal acoustic, elastic, and thermal systems. The proposed new paradigm -- geometry-based strong arrow of time in covariant and reversible physical systems -- has broad implications in many disciplines including string theory, cosmology, and astronomy.</description>

      <title>A general framework for knowledge integration in machine learning for electromagnetic scattering using quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have been demonstrated to be able to provide fast surrogate models that can accelerate the inverse design of optical and electromagnetic devices. Nevertheless, such neural networks can be unreliable and normally require extreme amounts of data for training. Here we show that these limitations can be alleviated by constraining neural-network models using prior knowledge about the governing physics. We propose a universal physics-informed neural network for electromagnetic scattering based on the quasinormal mode expansion of the scattering matrix. Our neural-network model learns the resonant structure underlying the scattering spectrum and is guaranteed to obey energy conservation and causality. We demonstrate significantly improved data efficiency for photonic-crystal slabs and all-dielectric free-form metasurfaces. The method can be applied to a wide range of optical and electromagnetic devices owing to the generality of the quasinormal mode formalism.</description>

      <title>Compact Plasmonic Logic Gates Enabled by Magnetoelectric Light Funneling for On-Chip Optical Computing in the Telecom Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of all-optical logic gates (AOLGs) is important for advancing photonic integrated circuit (PIC) design and optical data communication. Various photonic structures and design techniques, including two-dimensional photonic crystals, silicon waveguides, plasmonic waveguides, diffractive neural networks, and inverse design techniques, are actively being explored to achieve multifunctional, high-performance optical logic gates with fast data processing capabilities. Among these, plasmonic structure-based AOLGs often face challenges such as fabrication complexity and large device footprints when integrating multiple logic operations within a single structure. In this work, a planar and compact metal-insulator-metal (MIM) plasmonic waveguide structure is proposed for AOLG design, utilizing the light funneling effect in grooved metasurfaces. The designed device, with dimensions of 700 nm X 460 nm, successfully implements three fundamental logic gates (NOT, AND, OR) with a high contrast ratio of 18.69 dB. The device operates within the wavelength range of 1400 nm to 1450 nm, making it suitable for the telecommunications field. Its planar architecture offers fabrication feasibility and all logic gates can be controlled using a single light source incident from one specific direction, which facilitates its integration into photonic circuits with fast operational speed. This work contributes to the advancement of scalable and high-speed photonic computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design Optimization of MIS Nanorod Array to Enhance Wavelength-Selective Light Extraction of OLED through Guided SPCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary causes of low light extraction efficiency (LEE) in conventional OLEDs is the trapping of light within the substrate layer. To overcome this limitation, various nanostructures have recently been investigated for integration into different OLED layers, aiming to convert the trapped loss modes into out-coupled light and thereby improve LEE. In this work, we propose a simple yet innovative nanorod array design composed of metal, insulator, and semiconductor-oxide layers, integrated on the bottom surface of the OLED structure. This configuration enhances light extraction through guided surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE). Using an inverse design-based optimization approach, the structural parameters of the nanorods were optimized to achieve wavelength-selective LEE enhancement. The periodic MIS nanorod array was optimized via the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for different emission wavelengths, yielding improvements of 29\%, 30\%, and 51\% at 440 nm, 550 nm, and 540 nm, respectively, compared with conventional OLEDs. In addition, the optimized arrays demonstrate high spectral luminous efficiency (SLE), reduced UV transmittance, and uniform emission directionality. These enhancements have significant potential to advance OLED-based display technologies.</description>

      <title>A Cryogenic Dielectric Antenna for Wireless Sensing and Interfacing Outside the 10 K Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance and scalability of cryogenic microwave systems, particularly for quantum processors, are fundamentally limited by the thermal stability and loss of their constituent dielectric materials. While mixed titanate ceramics like MgTiO3-CaTiO3 (MCT) and (Zr,Sn)TiO4 (ZST) are primary candidates, their comparative performance as radiative antennas in the deep-cryogenic regime has remained uncharacterized. Here we present a side-by-side comparison of MCT and ZST operated as dielectric resonator antennas from 296 K down to 7-10 K under identical fixtures and protocols. While the MCT resonator exhibits large, nonlinear frequency drift (230 MHz by 10 K), pronounced thermal hysteresis, and a collapse of the loaded quality factor at low temperature-behavior consistent with incipient/relaxor-like losses, the ZST resonator demonstrates exceptional stability. Its resonant frequency shifts by only 30 MHz, its loaded Q-factor is enhanced by 20-25%, and it shows negligible thermal hysteresis. Leveraging these properties, we operate the ZST disk as a radiative antenna at 10 K with only 1 mW input, establishing a through-window wireless link that detects room-temperature dielectric targets over multiple wavelengths via near-field frequency shifts and far-field magnitude modulations. This presents a viable path toward non-invasive cryogenic diagnostics and wireless interconnects that circumvent the thermal load of physical cabling. Our findings establish ZST as a foundational material for high-coherence quantum interfaces and provide a practical template for designing wireless cryogenic systems.</description>

      <title>Interferometric method to detect degenerate index states of polarization singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An innovative interference-based method for detecting degenerate index states of polarization singularity is presented here. Index degeneracy occurs when different combinations of spin and orbital angular momentum states are superposed to form the polarization singularity. The technique presented here utilizes the interference of a polarization singular beam with a spherical reference beam to create distinct interference patterns. The interference fringes generated by the setup consist of the fork as well as spiral fringes. Two observations, one on the interference pattern and the other on the projection of the interference pattern on one of the linear basis states pertaining to $S_{2}$ Stokes polarization parameter. This allows straightforward identification and quantification of degenerate index states of polarization singular beam. Beyond resolving index degeneracies, the method can also be extended to determine the coordinates on the Hybrid-order Poincar\'e Sphere (HyOPS) as well as the relative phase shift between orthogonal components in the input polarization beam. Both simulation and experimental results validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Phase-space nonseparability, partial coherence, and optical beam shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a paraxial wave packet is reflected or refracted from a planar interface separating two material media, it experiences spatial and angular shifts of its center position with respect to predictions of the geometrical ray picture. These in-plane and out-of-plane beam shifts are known as Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts, respectively. We discover a universal link between the phase-space nonseparability of an incident wave packet of any degree of spatial coherence and the reflected beam shifts. We unveil coherence Goos-H\"anchen and coherence Hall effects, absent in the fully coherent limit. While the former effect can trigger a pronounced enhancement of the spatial Goos-H\"anchen shift, the latter enables control of the spatial Imbert-Fedorov shift, from complete cancellation at a certain incidence angle to dramatic enhancement of the shift to giant magnitudes for nearly incoherent incident wave packets. Our results are equally applicable to optical, X-ray, neutron, as well as matter waves, and they showcase novel phenomena in wave-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Continuous Recovery of Phase from Single Interferogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method for phase recovery from a single two-beam interferogram is presented. Conventional approaches, relying on trigonometric inversion followed by phase unfolding and unwrapping, are hindered by discontinuities, typically addressed through intricate algorithms. Our method bypasses the unfolding and unwrapping, instead formulating a first-order differential equation directly relating the phase to the interferogram. Integration of this equation enables continuous retrieval of phase along any straight path. Representing a new class of analytical tools for single-interferogram phase retrieval, this approach is derived from first principles and accommodates both Newton-type and Fizeau-type interferograms. Its performance is demonstrated on multiple idealized synthetic interferograms of increasing complexity, validating against the known seed phase.</description>

      <title>Photonic Filter for THz via optical injection into a feedback-controlled on-chip multi-wavelength laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for ultra-fast wireless data transmission is accelerating the exploration of THz frequencies for next-generation wireless communication systems. THz photonics provides a platform for generating, processing, and detecting THz signals by upconversion to the optical domain and leveraging the large available bandwidth of photonic devices at optical frequencies. However, efficient, tunable, and agile photonic filters remain a significant technical challenge. Here, we present a monolithically-integrated, feedback-controlled multiwavelength laser (MWL) enabling photonic filtering through regenerative amplification induced by optical signal injection. The feedback cavity enables agile control of the filter response by tuning the feedback phase. We experimentally demonstrate selective filtering of an upconverted THz signal comprising two channels separated by 34 GHz and offset by 1.3 THz from the carrier. Using a broadband signal, our photonic filter achieves up to 20dB suppression ratio, 3-dB bandwidths as narrow as 160 MHz, and optical gain of up to 15 dB for lowpower optical signals commonly obtained after THz-to-optical conversion, making it highly attractive for THz communication links.</description>

      <title>Perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex driven high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of high-order harmonic beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) promises application in diverse research fields. Recently, the perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex (PSTOV) beam has garnered much attention due to its topological charge (TC)-independent ring size and intensity distribution in the spatiotemporal plane. Here, we theoretically investigate the harmonic generation process in atomic gases driven PSTOV beams carrying transverse OAM. The unique spatiotemporal characteristics of the PSTOV beam make it an excellent candidate to generate harmonic beams with high TC values. We demonstrate that the conservation of transverse OAM is strictly followed when the harmonic generation is driven by the PSTOV beam. Additionally, in the near-field, the intensity distributions of harmonics show tilted lobed structures, which encapsulate information about the TC. By solving the Fraunhofer diffraction integral, we demonstrate that the generated harmonic vortices exhibit similar divergence properties at the far-field. Our research provides a unique route to create Bessel-Gauss spatiotemporal optical vortex beams with high TC in the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) spectral regime.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Resolved Atmospheric Turbulence Sensing with Two-Dimensional Orbital Angular Momentum Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence characterization is crucial for technologies like free-space optical communications. Existing methods using a spatially-integrated one-dimensional (1D) orbital angular momentum (OAM) spectrum, P(m), obscure the heterogeneous nature of atmospheric distortions. This study introduces a two-dimensional (2D) OAM spectroscopy, P(m, n), which resolves the OAM spectrum (topological charge m) across discrete radial annuli (index n). Integrating this high-dimensional spectral analysis with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier significantly improves the accuracy of atmospheric turbulence parameter inversion. The full potential of complex probe beams, such as multi-ringed Bessel-Gaussian beams, is realized with this radially-resolved 2D analysis. Through a co-design of the probe beam's spatial structure and the OAM spectral analysis dimensionality, a median classification accuracy of 85.47% was achieved across 20 turbulence conditions, a 23% absolute improvement over 1D techniques. The radial index also mitigates insufficient OAM spectral range, and a targeted feature-selection protocol addresses noise from low signal-to-noise ratio outer radial regions. This framework emphasizes co-design of the optical probe field and its OAM spectral analysis for enhanced fidelity in turbulence characterization.</description>

      <title>Observation of the non-diffraction of natural skyrmions with subwavelength confinement around optical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a fundamental fact of waves that they spread as they evolve freely, regardless of their nature. Previous research to overcome diffraction spreading has led to idealized waves that, in real settings, exhibit quasi-non-diffraction and eventually spread. Here we demonstrate that the optical skyrmion that is naturally present in optical vortices is a structure of light that is exempt from diffraction. It propagates without any change in shape and size within a tube of arbitrary subwavelength radius determined by the vortex orbital and spin angular momenta. Non-diffracting propagation of a subwavelength structure of light that does not raise infinite-power issues differs drastically from all previous forms of light propagation, which may open up new perspectives in its countless applications.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic spectroscopy of mobility edges in one-dimensional quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals occupy a unique position between periodic and disordered systems, where localization phenomena such as Anderson transitions and mobility edges can emerge even in the absence of disorder. This distinctive behavior motivates the development of robust, all-optical diagnostic tools capable of probing the structural, topological, and dynamical properties of such systems. In this work, focusing on generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper models, we demonstrate that high-harmonic generation phenomenon serves as a powerful probe of localization transitions and mobility edges in quasicrystals. We introduce a new order parameter--dipole mobility--which captures the impact of intraband dipole transitions and enables classification of nonlinear optical regimes, where excitation and high-harmonic generation yield can differ by orders of magnitude. We show that the cutoff frequency of harmonics is strongly influenced by the position of the mobility edge, providing a robust and experimentally accessible signature of localization transitions in quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Optically interrogated liquid crystal-based, charge-mode accelerometer telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid optoelectronic vibration sensing system is presented, combining a conventional charge-mode piezoelectric accelerometer with an optical fiber interface via a liquid crystal-based electrical-to-optical transducer. This configuration allows the accelerometer's electrical output to be converted into an optical signal, enabling remote signal transmission over optical fiber. The same fiber could also be used to supply power to the system, offering a compact and interference-resistant solution suitable for challenging environments such as those with high voltages or explosive risks. Experimental results demonstrate a displacement resolution ranging from \Delta z = 0.015 nm at 0.160 nm displacement, up to \Delta z = 0.720 nm at 351 nm displacement, or equivalently, from \alpha = 0.0005 m/s2 to 0.057 m/s2 in acceleration. Despite undergoing electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical signal conversion, the system maintains high sensitivity, low noise levels, and signal integrity. This proof-of-concept optically interrogated accelerometer highlights a path toward reducing sensor infrastructure requirements by eliminating the need for conventional power supplies and electromagnetic shielding, which are typically required in fully electrical accelerometer systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Localisation in Time from PT Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time has entered the domain of topological phases in the field of non-Hermitian physics. Previous studies have relied on periodic modulation in time to make an intuitive connection to established spatial topological invariants, albeit with energy and momentum exchanged. This connection has revealed the potential for topological interface states along the time axis, analogous to those in spatial models. In this work, we uncover a theoretical framework describing such topological interface states along the time axis, with no underlying connection to spatial models nor need for periodic driving. This new framework uncovers that this phenomenon -- the robust localisation of waves at an interface -- appears in every system that has parity-time symmetry and two levels or bands, regardless of its spatial dimensionality. The topological nature of this localisation is understood by the identification of certain topological phases that are specific to parity-time symmetric models of two levels. Our results set out the first approach to identifying topological effects intrinsically linked to time and showcase the universal nature of such effects.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear chiral light generation from resonant metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral nonlinear response has been explored for decades due to its extreme sensitivity to molecular and structural dissymmetry. Conventional approaches often require bulky systems and produce only static nonlinear chirality. Here, we report on a generic mechanism for the generation and control of nonlinear chiral light in resonant optical systems. We reveal that nonlinear resonant generation of circularly polarized light from achiral dielectric metasurfaces is extremely sensitive to the polarization state of the fundamental wave, and a resonant metasurface can produce light with arbitrary degree of nonlinear chirality (DNC). Experimentally, we demonstrate that the chirality of nonlinear radiation from one metasurface can be continuously tuned from DNC = -0.86 to DNC = 0.94 by simply varying the polarization angle of the incident wave. By further exploiting the instantaneous polarization state, nonlinear chirality has been switched in a delay time step of 3.2 fs, which is orders of magnitude more sensitive than the current state-of-the-art polarization modulation. These results promise to enrich our understanding of nonlinear processes in chiral structures and their manipulation with resonant photonic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical investigation into the phenomenon of filter-induced modulation instability in passive hybrid optical resonators exhibiting quadratic and cubic nonlinearity. We show that asymmetric spectral losses, with respect to the continuous-wave solution frequency, can trigger sideband amplification in the normal dispersion regime. We calculate the parametric gain and demonstrate the associated pattern formation process. We furthermore show how this parametric process can be exploited to generate optical frequency combs with tunable repetition rate.</description>

      <title>Generation of Correlated Quantum Random Number Sequences with Bright Twin Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum random number generators play a vital role in securing communication and encryption. In the present work, we have produced bright twin beams using four-wave mixing in a double-{\Lambda} configuration in rubidium-85 vapor and generated two strings of highly correlated random numbers. The randomness originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Stability of Adiabatic States in a Dissipative Three-Level System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of adiabatic states in three-level quantum systems are investigated analytically and numerically. Various possible configurations of three-level systems under exact two-photon resonance are considered. It is shown that in all these schemes, the lifetime of the studied states is determined by the dephasing time between levels that are not connected by a dipole transition. An efficient population transfer through the b-state at room temperature is demonstrated despite relatively long relaxation times. It is also demonstrated that, in case of large one-photon detuning, the so-called b-state has the same lifetime as that of the dark state. The evolution of adiabatic states for arbitrary values of single-photon detunings has been studied numerically.</description>

      <title>Quantum optics in the turbulent atmosphere: Fundamental issues and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum light propagation through turbulent atmosphere has become a subject of intensive research, spanning both theoretical and experimental studies. This interest is driven by its important applications in free-space quantum communication, remote quantum sensing, and environmental monitoring. At the same time, this phenomenon itself poses an intriguing fundamental problem. A consistent theoretical description typically makes explicit assumptions about the measurement scheme at the receiver station and/or the method of quantum-information encoding. A common and straightforward approach encodes the information in quantum states of a quasi-monochromatic mode, representing a pulsed Gaussian beam. Atmospheric turbulence induces random distortions of the pulse shape and, consequently, random fluctuations of the transmittance through the receiver aperture. These fluctuations, characterized by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT), directly affect the quantum state of the received light. In this paper we examine various analytical models of the PDT, validate them through numerical simulations, and assess their range of applicability. Furthermore, we extend the analysis beyond the standard ensemble-averaging approach, recognizing that realistic experiments typically involve time averaging. This requires a detailed examination of the underlying random process, including the study of temporal correlations and their impact on nonclassical properties of electromagnetic radiation.</description>

      <title>Observation of temporal Wood's anomaly in folded time gratings: surface-wave-enhanced transmission and the emergence of gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wood's anomaly is a fundamental wave phenomenon that stems from the interplay between farfields and surface-wave (SW) resonances through structured interfaces. Recent theories have suggested temporal analogs of such SW coupling processes by employing frequency transitions via time-periodic interfaces, rather than classical wavevector (momentum) transitions via space-periodic gratings. In this paper, we observe this phenomenon experimentally by devising a folded time grating of a single, waveguide-enclosed, time-modulated element; this substantially reduces complexity and power consumption and facilitates transmissive operation. We support our findings by deriving a comprehensive Floquet-Bloch analysis that exhibits excellent agreement with measurements. Importantly, we utilize our framework and experiment to reveal a unique regime of temporal Wood's anomaly, in which coupling to negative SW frequencies manifests tunable parametric amplification unattainable via traditional spatial modulation. Beyond the fundamental contribution, our results provide an economical path for universally synthesizing intricate temporal apertures to enhance dynamic filtering and leaky-wave antennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum-system dynamics can follow exponential decay, non-exponential relaxation, or oscillatory dynamics, depending on the system-environment coupling. We study a lattice with a boundary defect that transitions between these regimes, controlled by a single parameter. Extending the exact solution to the oscillatory case, we establish a unified theory confirmed by experiments in integrated waveguide arrays. We characterize finite-size effects by comparing analytics, numerics, and data. This provides a benchmark for emulating infinite systems and studying open systems in photonic lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Important advances have recently been made in the search for materials with complex multi-phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light-matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above-bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes has been experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion has been limited to perturbative levels. Here, this challenge is overcome by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid-infrared pulses, ferroelectric reversal is induced in lithium niobate, and the large-amplitude mode displacements are characterized through femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering and second harmonic generation. This approach, validated by first-principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast speeds.</description>

Abstract: We propose a microscopic mechanism to electrically reconfigure the Kerr nonlinearity by modulating the concentration of free electrons in heavily doped semiconductors under a static bias. Our theory incorporates electrostatic and hydrodynamic frameworks to describe the electronic dynamics, demonstrating electrically tunable linear and nonlinear modulations. The power threshold of achieving optical bistability shows unprecedented tunability over two orders of magnitude, reaching values as low as 10 $\mu$W through surface charge control. These findings offer new insights into understanding and actively controlling Kerr nonlinearities, paving the way for efficient refractive index engineering as well as the development of advanced linear and nonlinear electro-optical modulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic-field-dependent contrast and coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at \SI{750}{nm} while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the shot-noise-limited magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 49.07(33) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized NV-diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 ft/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.</description>

      <title>Profile control of fibre-based micro-mirrors using adaptive laser shooting with $\textit{in situ}$ imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fibre Fabry-Perot cavities (FFPCs) are used in various studies in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and quantum technologies due to the cavity's small mode volume and compact integration with optical fibres. We develop a novel $\text{CO}_2$ laser machining method that produces well-controlled surface profiles on the end facets of cleaved optical fibres. Using multiple shots in distinct spatial distribution patterns, our method employs a shooting algorithm that adaptively changes laser ablation parameters during the shooting to suppress deviations from the desired profile. This is made possible by $\textit{in situ}$ imaging of the machined profile, its inspection and the usage of the information in the subsequent steps. Underlying this algorithm is a newly found laser ablation parameter, the pause between shots, which controls the accumulation of heat in between successive laser shots and as a result determines the area of impact made by an individual ablation sequence. We fabricate fibre-based micro-mirrors with radii of curvature ranging from 250 $\mu$m to 700 $\mu$m with an effective mirror diameter of 60 $\mu$m in either Gaussian or spherical profiles. Due to the self-correcting nature of our adaptive algorithm, we achieve a near 100\% success rate in the production of desired profiles with low ellipticity. After furnishing the laser machined fibre end facets with high reflectivity coating, FFPCs are formed to demonstrate a high finesse up to 150,000 at an optical wavelength of 854 nm.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the band structure and the dynamics of topological singularities of magneto-optical Moir\'e bound states in the continuum (BICs), which originate from two overlapped conventional magneto-optical BIC gratings with mismatched periods. We show that breaking time-reversal symmetry by applying an external magnetic field in different directions can effectively manipulate the Moir\'e BICs' topological singularities, which exhibit a high Q factor throughout the momentum space.</description>

Abstract: A mathematical algorithm is described for calculating the minimum distance between prisms and the allowable prism insertion depth into the laser beam when solving the general problem of intracavity group delay dispersion (GDD) compensation. GDD is caused by the optical elements of the master oscillator in a femtosecond laser system. The calculation was carried out using analytical and geometrical methods. The influence of changing the distance between the prisms and the depth of their insertion into the laser beam on the GDD compensation has been investigated. Under experimental conditions, this changes the Q-factor of the laser resonator, which determines the central wavelength of the radiation and its spectral width in a titanium-sapphire laser.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable integrated chips of photonic components and networks are envisaged to play a key role in realizing highly efficient integrated photonic information processing. Electrothermally modulated optical effect (ETMOE) is a powerful thermo-optic tuning mechanism for silicon photonic devices, enabling precise optical control via localized Joule heating. We present a rigorous and three-dimensional electronic-photonic co-integrated approach with the nonlinear numerical coupling of temperature and wavelength-dependent material properties to comprehensively model ETMOE in silicon waveguides and resonators. A platinum-based symmetric heater is optimized using advanced true 3D numerical simulations, achieving efficient ETMOE-based tuning while mitigating asymmetric heat distribution. In addition to a complete design and analysis of the fully integrated three-dimensional switch, we also evaluate single-mode waveguide cutoff, heater-to-waveguide separation, heater dimensions, and thermal dissipation, providing a framework for ETMOE-based optimization. The findings contribute to energy-efficient, programmable photonic systems for neuromorphic computing, optical interconnects, and reconfigurable photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Modelling Purcell enhancement of metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) exhibit extremely high quality factors due to the lack of radiation loss and thus are widely studied for Purcell enhancement. However, a closer examination reveals that the enhancement is absent at the BIC due to the lack of out-coupling capability, but the strong enhancement is only observed at nearby configuration, namely quasi-BIC. To study this unique behavior of the Purcell enhancement near BIC, we built an analytically model with spectral parameters to analyze the Purcell enhancement on metasurfaces supporting quasi-BIC. Our analytical model predicts the average Purcell enhancement by metasurfaces coupled to a luminescent medium, utilizing parameters that are formulated through the temporal coupled-mode theory and can be derived from measured spectra such as transmissivity and reflectivity. We analyzed several metasurfaces supporting quasi-BIC numerically and experimentally to study the behavior of the spectral parameters as well as the resultant Purcell enhancement. We formulated the interdependence between the quality factor and the out-coupling efficiency, and revealed the existence of optimal detuning from the BIC. We also discovered that our findings are general and applicable towards realistic metasurfaces that are lossy and/or asymmetric. This discovery provides an intuitive model to understand the modal qualities of quasi-BIC and will facilitate optimization of quasi-BIC for luminescence enhancement applications.</description>

      <title>Million-Q Dual-Polarization Micro-Fabry-Perot Resonators in Silicon Nitride Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Miniaturized Fabry-Perot standing-wave resonators and whispering-gallery travelling wave resonators constitute foundational building blocks for photonic integrated circuits. While both architectures offer transformative potential through high quality factors and dual-polarization operation, integrated Fabry-Perot resonators face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving ultra-high Q-factors and broadband thermal tunability for fundamental transverse magnetic (TM0) and transverse electric (TE0) modes within a compact footprint-primarily due to polarization-dependent losses in conventional chip-scale reflectors. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating an integrated silicon nitride dual-polarization micro-Fabry-Perot resonator with polarization-insensitive Sagnac loop reflectors and multimode waveguides to effectively suppress losses and enable high-performances for both fundamental transverse magnetic (TM0) and transverse electric (TE0) modes. The device achieves record loaded quality factors of 2.38*106 (TM0) and 3.48*105 (TE0) respectively and intrinsic quality factors will be even higher. Moreover, both two modes are tuned over the whole free spectral range of around 0.111 nm (TM0) and 0.112 nm (TE0) with the thermal tuning efficiencies of approximately 1.04 pm/mW (TM0) and 1.24 pm/mW (TE0). These advances establish a new benchmark for compact, high-performance dual-polarization resonators in optical sensors, nonlinear and integrated quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Accurate Unsupervised Photon Counting from Transition Edge Sensor Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare methods for signal classification applied to voltage traces from transition-edge sensors (TES) which are photon-number resolving detectors fundamental for accessing quantum advantages in information processing, communication and metrology. We quantify the impact of numerical analysis on the distinction of such signals. Furthermore, we explore dimensionality reduction techniques to create interpretable and precise photon-number embeddings. We demonstrate that the preservation of local data structures of some nonlinear methods is an accurate way to achieve unsupervised classification of TES traces. We do so by considering a confidence metric that quantifies the overlap of the photon-number clusters inside a latent space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for our dataset previous methods such as the signal's area and principal component analysis can resolve up to 16 photons with confidence above $90\%$ while nonlinear techniques can resolve up to 21 with the same confidence threshold. Also, we showcase implementations of neural networks to leverage information within local structures, aiming to increase confidence in assigning photon numbers. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of some nonlinear methods to detect and remove outlier signals.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Photonic Implementation of Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) stands as a revolutionary approach to secure communication, using the principles of quantum mechanics to establish unbreakable channels. Unlike traditional cryptography, which relies on the computational difficulty of mathematical problems, QKD utilizes the inherent properties of quantum states to achieve information-theoretic security. This means that the security of the key exchange is guaranteed by the laws of physics, making it theoretically unbreakable even by an adversary with unlimited computational power. Currently, one of the most viable ways to implement QKD for communication is via photonics, namely, using phase-preserving long-distance optical fibers. The objective of this project is to implement photonic QKD in a laboratory setting. This will help demonstrate the protocol's robustness and provide a feasible implementation for educational demonstrations.</description>
