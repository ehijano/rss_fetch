      <title>Poisson statistics, vanishing correlations, and extremal particle limits for symmetric exclusion in d &gt; 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the symmetric simple exclusion system on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 2$, starting from a class of "step'' initial conditions in which particles are constrained within a half-space. One may count the number $N_t$ of particles that have moved beyond a distance $z = z(t)$ into the initially-empty half of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ at time $t$. We show in large generality that when $\lim_{t\to\infty} E[N_t]$ exists, correlations between particles beyond $z$ vanish as $t \to \infty$ so as to allow convergence of $N_t$ to the same Poisson distribution one would get were the particles allowed to move independently. More concretely, when the initial condition constrains a region of polynomial growth, we obtain a Gumbel limit distribution for the extremal particle position, as well as the limiting distributions of all order statistics, by identifying the growth of $z$ and the limit of $E[N_t]$ explicitly.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Species in a Competition Model on Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the coexistence of two competing species on random geometric graphs (RGGs) in continuous time. The species grow by occupying vacant sites according to Richardson's model, while simultaneously competing for occupied sites under the dynamics of the voter model. Coexistence is defined as the event in which both species occupy at least one site simultaneously at any given time. We prove that coexistence occurs with strictly positive annealed probability by applying results from moderate deviations in first-passage percolation and random walk theory, with a focus on specific regions of the space.</description>

      <title>Critical radii and suprema of random waves over Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random waves on smooth, compact, Riemannian manifolds under the spherical ensemble. Our first main result shows that there is a positive universal limit for the critical radius of a specific deterministic embedding, defined via the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, of such manifolds into higher dimensional Euclidean spaces. This result enables the application of Weyl's tube formula to derive the tail probabilities for the suprema of random waves. Consequently, the estimate for the expectation of the Euler characteristic of the excursion set follows directly.</description>

      <title>Functional limit theorems for a time-changed multidimensional Wiener process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of a properly normalized time-changed multidimensional Wiener process; the time change is given by an additive functional of the Wiener process itself. At the level of generators, the time change means that we consider the Laplace operator -- which generates a multidimensional Wiener process -- and multiply it by a (possibly degenerate) state-space dependent intensity. We assume that the intensity admits limits at infinity in each octant of the state space, but the values of these limits may be different. Applying a functional limit theorem for the superposition of stochastic processes, we prove functional limit theorems for the normalized time-changed multidimensional Wiener process. Among the possible limits there is a multidimensional analogue of skew Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with Double Mean Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the mean field backward stochastic differential equations (MFBSDEs) with double mean reflections, whose generator and constraints both depend on the distribution of the solution. When the generator is Lipschitz continuous, based on the backward Skorokhod problem with nonlinear constraints, we investigate the solvability of the doubly mean reflected MFBSDEs by constructing a contraction mapping. Furthermore, if the constraints are linear, the solution can also be constructed by a penalization method. For the case of quadratic growth, we obtain the existence and uniqueness results by using a fixed-point argument, the BMO martingale theory and the {\theta}-method.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov kinetic equations by inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the McKean-Vlasov equation $dX_t = b(t, X_t, [X_t])dt + \sigma(t, X_t, [X_t])dW_t$ where $[X_t]$ is the law of $X_t$. We focus specifically on the "kinetic" case, where the equation is degenerate in the sense that the dimension of the Brownian motion $W$ can be strictly less than the dimension of the solution $X$. Assuming H\"older continuous coefficients and a hypoellipticity condition, we prove the well-posedness of the equation. This result complements the existing literature by addressing the case where the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ depends on the law $[X_t]$, which have been previously unexplored. Our proof employs a novel technique that offers a simplified and direct argument, eliminating the need for PDEs involving derivatives with respect to the measure argument and exploiting the sub-Riemannian metric structure induced by the corresponding Fokker-Planck operator.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the Revuz correspondence under the absolute continuity condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider symmetric Hunt processes that correspond to regular Dirichlet forms and satisfy the absolute continuity condition, i.e., processes possess transition densities. For such processes, the Revuz correspondence relates positive continuous additive functionals (PCAFs) to so-called smooth measures. We show the continuity of this correspondence. Specifically, we show that if the $1$-potentials of smooth measures converge (locally) uniformly as functions, then the associated PCAFs converge. This result is derived by directly estimating the distance between the PCAFs using the distance between the $1$-potentials of the associated smooth measures. Furthermore, in cases where the transition density is jointly continuous, we present sufficient conditions for the convergence of $1$-potentials based on the weak or vague convergence of smooth measures.</description>

      <title>Isolated vertices in two duplication-divergence models with edge deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duplication-divergence models are a popular model for the evolution of gene and protein interaction networks. However, existing duplication-divergence models often neglect realistic features such as loss of interactions. Thus, in this paper we present two novel models that incorporate random edge deletions into the duplication-divergence framework. As in protein-protein interaction networks, with proteins as vertices and interactions as edges, by design isolated vertices tend to be rare, our main focus is on the number of isolated vertices; our main result gives lower and upper bounds for the proportion of isolated vertices, when the network size is large. Using these bounds we identify the parameter regimes for which almost all vertices are typically isolated; and also show that there are parameter regimes in which the proportion of isolated vertices can be bounded away from 0 and 1 with high probability. In addition, we find regimes in which the proportion of isolated vertices tends to be small. The proof relies on a standard martingale argument, which in turn requires a careful analysis of the first two moments of the expected degree distribution. The theoretical findings are illustrated by simulations, indicating that as the network size tends to infinity, the proportion of isolated vertices can converge to a limit that is neither 0 or 1.</description>

      <title>Random Subwords and Billiard Walks in Affine Weyl Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $W$ be an irreducible affine Weyl group, and let $\mathsf{b}$ be a finite word over the alphabet of simple reflections of $W$. Fix a probability $p\in(0,1)$. For each integer $K\geq 0$, let $\mathsf{sub}_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$ be the random subword of $\mathsf{b}^K$ obtained by deleting each letter independently with probability $1-p$. Let $v_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$ be the element of $W$ represented by $\mathsf{sub}_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$. One can view $v_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$ geometrically as a random alcove; in many cases, this alcove can be seen as the location after a certain amount of time of a random billiard trajectory that, upon hitting a hyperplane in the Coxeter arrangement of $W$, reflects off of the hyperplane with probability $1-p$. We show that the asymptotic distribution of $v_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$ is a central spherical multivariate normal distribution with some variance $\sigma_{\mathsf{b}}^2$ depending on $\mathsf{b}$ and $p$. We provide a formula to compute $\sigma_{\mathsf{b}}^2$ that is remarkably simple when $\mathsf{b}$ contains only one occurrence of the simple reflection that is not in the associated finite Weyl group. As a corollary, we provide an asymptotic formula for $\mathbb{E}[\ell(v_p(\mathsf{b}^K))]$, the expected Coxeter length of $v_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$. For example, when $W=\widetilde A_{r}$ and $\mathsf{b}$ contains each simple reflection exactly once, we find that \[\lim_{K\to\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}\mathbb{E}[\ell(v_p(\mathsf{b}^K))]=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}r(r+1)\frac{p}{1-p}}.\]</description>

      <title>Local Limits of Small World Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-world networks, known for their high local clustering and short average path lengths, are a fundamental structure in many real-world systems, including social, biological, and technological networks. We apply the theory of local convergence (Benjamini-Schramm convergence) to derive the limiting behavior of the local structures for two of the most commonly studied small-world network models: the Watts-Strogatz model and the Kleinberg model. Establishing local convergence enables us to show that key network measures, such as PageRank, clustering coefficients, and maximum matching size, converge as network size increases with their limits determined by the graph's local structure. Additionally, this framework facilitates the estimation of global phenomena, such as information cascades, using local information from small neighborhoods. As an additional outcome of our results, we observe a critical change in the behavior of the limit exactly when the parameter governing long-range connections in the Kleinberg model crosses the threshold where decentralized search remains efficient, offering a new perspective on why decentralized algorithms fail in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian sequential soft classification problem for a Brownian motion's drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we introduce and solve a soft classification version of the famous Bayesian sequential testing problem for a Brownian motion's drift. We establish that the value function is the unique non-trivial solution to a free boundary problem, and that the continuation region is characterized by two boundaries which may coincide if the observed signal is not strong enough. By exploiting the solution structure we are able to characterize the functional dependence of the stopping boundaries on the signal-to-noise ratio. We illustrate this relationship and compare our stopping boundaries to those derived in the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Multiply iterated Poisson processes and their applications in ruin theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of the Multiply Iterated Poisson Process (MIPP), a stochastic process constructed by repeatedly time-changing a Poisson process, and its applications in ruin theory. Like standard Poisson processes, MIPPs have exponentially distributed sojourn times (waiting times between jumps). We explicitly derive the probabilities of all possible jump sizes at the first jump and obtain the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of the first jump time and its corresponding jump size. In ruin theory, the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg model assumes claims arrive independently according to a Poisson process. In contrast, our model employs MIPP to allow for clustered arrivals, reflecting real-world scenarios, such as catastrophic events. Under this new framework, we derive the corresponding scale function in closed form, facilitating accurate ruin probability calculations in the presence of clustered claims. These results improve the modeling of extreme risks and have practical implications for insurance solvency assessments, reinsurance pricing, and capital reserve estimation.</description>

      <title>Steady state and mixing of two run-and-tumble particles interacting through jamming and attractive forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of two run-and-tumble particles on the real line subjected to an attractive interaction potential and jamming interactions, which prevent the particles from crossing. We provide the explicit invariant measure, a useful tool for studying clustering phenomena in out-ofequilibrium statistical mechanics, for different tumbling mechanisms and potentials. An important difference with invariant measures of equilibrium systems are Dirac masses on the boundary of the state space, due to the jamming interactions. Qualitative changes in the invariant measure depending on model parameters are also observed, suggesting, like a growing body of evidence, that run-andtumble particle systems can be classified into close-to-equilibrium and strongly out-of-equilibrium models. We also study the relaxation properties of the system, which are linked to the timescale at which clustering emerges from an arbitrary initial configuration. When the interaction potential is linear, we show that the total variation distance to the invariant measure decays exponentially and provide sharp bounds on the decay rate. When the interaction potential is harmonic, we give quantitative exponential bounds in a Wasserstein-type distance.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a novel first-passage percolation model, referred to as the Brochette first-passage percolation model, where the passage times associated with edges lying on the same line are equal. First, we establish a point-to-point convergence theorem, identifying the time constant. In particular, we explore the case where the time constant vanishes and demonstrate the existence of a wide range of possible behaviours. Next, we prove a shape theorem, showing that the limiting shape is the $L^1$ diamond. Finally, we extend the analysis by proving a point-to-point convergence theorem in the setting where passage times are allowed to be infinite.</description>

      <title>Second-order Asymptotic Analysis of Tail Probabilities of Randomly Weighted Sums: With Applications to a Bidimensional Discrete-time Risk Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a bidimensional discrete-time risk model in insurance, we study the second-order asymptotics for two kinds of tail probabilities of the stochastic discounted value of aggregate net losses including two business lines. These are essentially modeled as randomly weighted sums, in which it is assumed that the primary random variables form a sequence of real-valued, independent and identically distributed random pairs following a common bivariate Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern distribution and the random weights are bounded, nonnegative and arbitrarily dependent, but independent of the primary random variables. Under the assumption that two marginal distributions of the primary random variables are second-order subexponential, we first obtain the second-order asymptotics for the joint and sum tail probabilities, which generalizes and strengthens some known ones in the literature. Furthermore, by directly applying the obtained results to the above bidimensional risk model, we establish the second-order asymptotic formulas for the corresponding tail probabilities. Compared with the first-order one, our numerical simulation shows that second-order asymptotics are much more precise.</description>

      <title>On the time constant of high dimensional first passage percolation, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [2], it was claimed that the time constant $\mu_{d}(e_{1})$ for the first-passage percolation model on $\mathbb Z^{d}$ is $\mu_{d}(e_{1}) \sim \log d/(2ad)$ as $d\to \infty$, if the passage times $(\tau_{e})_{e\in \mathbb E^{d}}$ are i.i.d., with a common c.d.f. $F$ satisfying $\left|\frac{F(x)}{x}-a\right| \le \frac{C}{|\log x|}$ for some constants $a, C$ and sufficiently small $x$.
  However, the proof of the upper bound, namely, Equation (2.1) in [2] \begin{align} \limsup_{d\to\infty} \frac{\mu_{d}(e_{1})ad}{\log d} \le \frac{1}{2} \end{align} is incorrect. In this article, we provide a different approach that establishes this inequality. As a side product of this new method, we also show that the variance of the non-backtracking passage time to the first hyperplane is of order $o\big((\log d/d)^{2}\big)$ as $d\to \infty$ in the case of the when the edge weights are exponentially distributed.</description>

      <title>Inference for dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs under regime switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a model involving two dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs that {evolve} in parallel, where the edges in each of these graphs alternate between being present and absent according to specific on- and off-time distributions. In our setup there is {\it regime switching}, in that the graph that we observe depends on the mode of the {\it background process} at that point in time, this background process being modeled as an alternating renewal process.
  In our setup we only have access to aggregate quantities such as the number of active edges or the counts of specific subgraphs (such as stars or {complete graphs}) in the observed graph; importantly, we do not observe the mode. The objective is to estimate the on- and off-time distributions of the edges in each of the two dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, as well as the distribution of time spent in each of the two modes. By employing parametric models for the on- and off-times and the background process, we develop a method of moments approach to estimate the relevant parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recovering these parameters.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Limits for Nearly Unstable Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish general scaling limits for nearly unstable Hawkes processes in a mean-field regime by extending the method introduced by Jaisson and Rosenbaum. Under a mild asymptotic criticality condition on the self-exciting kernels $\{\phi^n\}$, specifically $\|\phi^n\|_{L^1} \to 1$, we first show that the scaling limits of these Hawkes processes are necessarily stochastic Volterra diffusions of affine type. Moreover, we establish a propagation of chaos result for Hawkes systems with mean-field interactions, highlighting three distinct regimes for the limiting processes, which depend on the asymptotics of $n(1-\|\phi^n\|_{L^1})^2$. These results provide a significant generalization of the findings by Delattre, Fournier and Hoffmann.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Parking Process and Labeled IDLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new probabilistic variant of the classical parking protocol of Konheim and Weiss [29], which is closely related to Internal Diffusion Limited Aggregation, or IDLA, introduced in 1991 by Diaconis and Fulton [15]. In particular, we show that if one runs our parking protocol starting with a parking function whose outcome permutation (in the sense of the classical parking process of Konheim and Weiss) is the identity permutation, then we can compute the exact probability that all of the cars park. Furthermore, we compute the expected time it takes for the protocol to complete assuming all of the cars park, and prove that the parking process is negatively correlated. We also study statistics of uniformly random weakly increasing parking functions, a subset of parking functions whose outcome is the identity permutation. We give the distribution of the last entry, along with the probability that a specific set of cars is lucky, and the expected number of lucky cars.</description>

      <title>Order of fluctuations of the free energy in the positive semi-definite MSK model at critical temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we consider the multi-species Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model at its conjectured critical temperature, and we show that, when the variance profile matrix $\Delta^2$ is positive semi-definite, the variance of the free energy is $O(\log^2N)$. Furthermore, when one approaches this temperature threshold from the low temperature side at a rate of $O(N^{-\alpha})$ with $\alpha&gt;0$, the variance is $O(\log^2N+N^{1-\alpha})$. This result is a direct extension of the work of Chen and Lam (2019) who proved an analogous result for the SK model, and our proof methods are adapted from theirs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the exit-time problem for time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes. The focus is on the small-noise behavior of the exit time from a bounded positively invariant domain. We demonstrate that, when the drift and diffusion terms are uniformly close to some time-independent functions, the exit time grows exponentially both in probability and in $L_1$ as a parameter that controls the noise tends to zero. We also characterize the exit position of the time-inhomogeneous process. Additionally, we investigate the impact of relaxing the uniform closeness condition on the exit-time behavior. As an application, we extend these results to the McKean-Vlasov process. Our findings improve upon existing results in the literature for the exit-time problem for this class of processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of multiscale McKean-Vlasov stochastic systems where the entire system depends on the distribution of the fast component. First of all, by the Poisson equation method we prove that the slow component converges to the solution of the averaging equation in the $L^p$ ($p\geq 2$) space with the optimal convergence rate 1/2. Then a central limit theorem is established by tightness.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Slow-Fast Mean-Field Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the large deviations for a class of slow-fast mean-field diffusions, which extends some existing results to the case where the laws of fast process are also involved in the slow component. Due to the perturbations of fast process and its time marginal law, one cannot prove the large deviations based on verifying the powerful weak convergence criterion directly. To overcome this problem, we employ the functional occupation measure, which combined with the notion of the viable pair and the controls of feedback form to characterize the limits of controlled sequences and justify the upper and lower bounds of Laplace principle. As a consequence, the explicit representation formula of the rate function for large deviations is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The It\^o formula, originated by K. It\^o, is focus on the stochastic calculus, where many stochastic processes can be placed under the framework of rough paths. In rough path theory, It\^o formulas have been proved for rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{3}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$ and branched rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$. Planarly branched rough paths contain more random processes than rough paths and branched rough paths. In the present paper, we prove the It\^o formula for planarly branched rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{4}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>A trajectorial approach to the gradient flow of McKean-Vlasov SDEs with mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the gradient flow representation of diffusion with mobility $b$ with respect to the modified Wasserstein quasi-metric $W_h$, where $h(r)=rb(r)$. The appropriate selection of the free energy functional depends on the specific form of the generalized entropy. Different from the JKO scheme, we derive the trajectorial version of the relative entropy dissipation identity for the McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE) with Nemytskii-type coefficients, utilizing techniques from stochastic analysis. Based on this, we demonstrate that the trajectorial average of the solution process to the McKean-Vlasov SDE, with respect to the underlying measure, corresponds to the rate of dissipation of the free energy. As an application, we present the energy dissipation of the Fermi-Dirac-Fokker-Planck equation, a model widely used in physics and biology to describe saturation effects. Inspired by numerical simulations, we propose two questions on condensation phenomena and non-exponential convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quenched critical percolation on a supercritical Galton--Watson tree with either finite variance or $\alpha$-stable offspring tails for some $\alpha \in (1,2)$. We show that the GHP scaling limit of a quenched critical percolation cluster on this tree is the corresponding $\alpha$-stable tree, as is the case in the annealed setting. As a corollary we obtain that a simple random walk on the cluster also rescales to Brownian motion on the stable tree. Along the way, we also obtain quenched asymptotics for the tail of the cluster size, which completes earlier results obtained in Michelen (2019) and Archer-Vogel (2024).</description>

      <title>Gradually Declining Immunity Retains the Exponential Duration of Immunity-Free Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion processes pervade numerous areas of AI, abstractly modeling the dynamics of exchanging, oftentimes volatile, information in networks. A central question is how long the information remains in the network, known as survival time. For the commonly studied SIS process, the expected survival time is at least super-polynomial in the network size already on star graphs, for a wide range of parameters. In contrast, the expected survival time of the SIRS process, which introduces temporary immunity, is always at most polynomial on stars and only known to be super-polynomial for far denser networks, such as expanders. However, this result relies on featuring full temporary immunity, which is not always present in actual processes. We introduce the cSIRS process, which incorporates gradually declining immunity such that the expected immunity at each point in time is identical to that of the SIRS process. We study the survival time of the cSIRS process rigorously on star graphs and expanders and show that its expected survival time is very similar to that of the SIS process, which features no immunity. This suggests that featuring gradually declining immunity is almost as having none at all.</description>

      <title>A quadratic BSDE approach to normalization for the finite volume 2D sine-Gordon model in the finite ultraviolet regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a new construction of the two-dimensional sine-Gordon model on bounded domains by a novel normalization technique in the finite ultraviolet regime. Our methodology involves a family of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs for short) driven by a cylindrical Wiener process, whose generators are purely quadratic functions of the second unknown variable. The terminal conditions of the quadratic BSDEs are uniformly bounded and converge in probability to the real part of imaginary multiplicative chaos tested against an arbitrarily given test function, which helps us describe our sine-Gordon measure through some delicate estimates concerning bounded mean oscillation martingales. As the ultraviolet cutoffs are vanishing, the quadratic BSDEs converge to a quadratic BSDE that completely characterizes the absolute continuity of our sine-Gordon measure with respect to the law of Gaussian free fields. Our approach can also be used effectively to establish the connection between our sine-Gordon measure and the scaling limit of correlation functions of the critical planar XOR-Ising model and to prove the weak convergence of the normalized charge distributions of two-dimensional log-gases.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Some Feynman-Kac Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods were initiated by Mark Kac and Richard Feynman to evaluate random functionals of the form $\int^t_0V(X_s)ds$ for a nonnegative $V$ and a Markov process $X_t$. Their results evolved into the well known Feynman Kac formula. Functionals of this type appear in both theoretical and applied applications in partial differential equations, quantum physics, mathematical finance, control theory, etc. Here the time average of one such functional associated with the Feynman Kac formula is studied. In real time applications where only the path is observed, the time average often is a better predictor than the functional at its last observation point.. It represents quantities, e.g., the long term average cost or wealth, the long term average velocity. As a statistic, it is of interest to determine if it has an asymptotic limit and to determine that limit. An expression is derived for its asymptotic time average.</description>

      <title>An individual-based stochastic model reveals strong constraints on allometric relationships with minimal metabolic and ecological assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a stochastic individual-based model structured in energy, for single species consuming an external resource, where populations are characterized by a typical energy at birth in $\mathbb{R}^{*}_{+}$. The resource is maintained at a fixed amount, so we benefit from a branching property at the population level. Thus, we focus on individual trajectories, constructed as Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes, with random jumps modelling births and deaths in the population; and a continuous and deterministic evolution of energy between jumps. We are mainly interested in the case where metabolic (i.e. energy loss for maintenance), growth, birth and death rates depend on the individual energy over time, and follow allometric scalings (i.e. power laws). Our goal is to determine in a bottom-up approach what are the possible allometric coefficients (i.e. exponents of these power laws) under elementary -- and ecologically relevant -- constraints, for our model to be valid for the whole spectrum of possible body sizes. We show in particular that assuming an allometric coefficient $\alpha$ related to metabolism strongly constrains the range of possible values for the allometric coefficients $\beta$, $\delta$, $\gamma$, respectively related to birth, death and growth rates. We further identify and discuss the precise and minimal ecological mechanisms that are involved in these strong constraints on allometric scalings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a case study of probabilistic approach to topological quantum field theory via the example of topological quantum mechanics. We propose that the topological correlations are realized in the large variance limit. An investigation on the relation between probabilistic topological correlations on the circle and Hochschild homology is illustrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of infinite-horizon impulse control problems with execution delay in discrete time. Using probabilistic methods, particularly the notion of the Snell envelope of processes, we construct an optimal strategy among all admissible strategies for both risk-neutral and risk-sensitive utility functions. Furthermore, we establish the existence of bounded $\epsilon$-optimal strategies. This framework provides a robust approach to handling execution delays in discrete-time stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Benford Framework for Threat Identification in Counter-Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a framework of 'Benford models' for counter-intelligence investigations which analyze frequency data of a suspect's visits to physical locations, online websites, and communication channels. We accomplish this by establishing the Benford measure for continuous &amp; bounded domains, generalizing the accumulated percentage differences between sites in the frequency data with the log-determinant of 'Benford Matrices,' employing an estimator to determine a 'Benford Test Statistic,' and identifying maximal values of that test statistic across all permutations of included sites in our data. This framework is intended to complement outlier analysis models by finding where hidden Benford patterns 'break' in frequency data and telling investigators which sites they should investigate.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Gaussianity of heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous diffusion processes are prevalent in various fields, including the motion of proteins in living cells, the migratory movement of birds and mammals, and finance. These processes are often characterized by time-varying dynamics, where interactions with the environment evolve, and the system undergoes fluctuations in diffusivity. Moreover, in many complex systems anomalous diffusion is observed, where the mean square displacement (MSD) exhibits non-linear scaling with time. Among the models used to describe this phenomenon, fractional Brownian motion (FBM) is a widely applied stochastic process, particularly for systems exhibiting long-range temporal correlations. Although FBM is characterized by Gaussian increments, heterogeneous processes with FBM-like characteristics may deviate from Gaussianity. In this article, we study the non-Gaussian behavior of switching fractional Brownian motion (SFBM), a model in which the diffusivity of the FBM process varies while temporal correlations are maintained. To characterize non-Gaussianity, we evaluate the kurtosis, a common tool used to quantify deviations from the normal distribution. We derive exact expressions for the kurtosis of the considered heterogeneous anomalous diffusion process and investigate how it can identify non-Gaussian behavior. We also compare the kurtosis results with those obtained using the Hellinger distance, a classical measure of divergence between probability density functions. Through both analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate the potential of kurtosis as a metric for detecting non-Gaussianity in heterogeneous anomalous diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Random LR Fuzzy Intervals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random fuzzy variables join the modeling of the impreciseness (due to their ``fuzzy part'') and randomness. Statistical samples of such objects are widely used, and their direct, numerically effective generation is therefore necessary. Usually, these samples consist of triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In this paper, we describe theoretical results and simulation algorithms for another family of fuzzy numbers -- LR fuzzy numbers with interval-valued cores. Starting from a simulation perspective on the piecewise linear LR fuzzy numbers with the interval-valued cores, their limiting behavior is then considered. This leads us to the numerically efficient algorithm for simulating a sample consisting of such fuzzy values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of marked binary Galton-Watson trees that can model individual types in population genetics, by allowing for mutation and reversion in discrete and continuous time. We derive a recursive formula for the computation of the joint distribution of types conditional to the value of the total progeny. This allows us to compute the evolution of various expected quantities, such as the mean proportions of different types as the tree size or time increases. Some generating functions are determined in explicit forms using generalized Catalan numbers, and integrability criteria are obtained as a consequence.</description>

      <title>The stochastic porous medium equation in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the porous medium equation (PME) in one space dimension in presence of additive non-conservative white noise, and interpreted as a stochastic growth equation for the height field of an interface. We predict the values of the two growth exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using the functional RG. Extensive numerical simulations show agreement with the predicted values for these exponents, however they also show anomalous scaling with an additional "local" exponent $\alpha_{\rm loc}$, as well as multiscaling originating from broad distributions of local height differences. The stationary measure of the stochastic PME is found to be well described by a random walk model, related to a Bessel process. This model allows for several predictions about the multiscaling properties.</description>

Abstract: We give a simple alternative proof of Royen's Gaussian Correlation inequality by using (a slightly generalized version of) Nakamura-Tsuji's symmetric inverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality for even log-concave functions. We explain that this inverse inequality is in a certain sense a dual counterpart to the forward inequality of Bennett-Carbery-Christ-Tao and Valdimarsson, and that the log-concavity assumption therein cannot be omitted in general.</description>

      <title>Almost sure bounds for weighted sums of Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that when $f$ is a Rademacher random multiplicative function for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, then $\sum_{n \leqslant x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ll (\log\log(x))^{3/4+\epsilon}$ for almost all $f$. We also show that there exist arbitrarily large values of $x$ such that $\sum_{n \leqslant x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \gg (\log\log(x))^{-1/2}$. This is different to what is found in the Steinhaus case, this time with the size of the Rademacher Euler product making the multiplicative chaos contribution the dominant one. We also find a sharper upper bound when we restrict to integers with a prime factor greater than $\sqrt{x}$, proving that $\sum_{\substack{n \leqslant x \\ P(n) &gt; \sqrt{x}}}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ll (\log\log(x))^{1/4+\epsilon}$.</description>

Abstract: M. E. Larsen evaluated the Wronskian determinant of functions $\{\sin(mx)\}_{1\le m \le n}$. We generalize this result and compute the Wronskian of $\{\sin(mx)\}_{1\le m \le n-1}\cup \{\sin((k+n)x\} $. We show that this determinant can be expressed in terms of Gegenbauer orthogonal polynomials and we give two proofs of this result: a direct proof using recurrence relations and a less direct (but, possibly, more instructive) proof based on Darboux-Crum transformations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive an expression for the expected number of runs in a trace of a binary sequence $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ obtained by passing $x$ through a deletion channel that independently deletes each bit with probability $q$. We use this expression to show that if $x$ is a codeword of a first-order Reed-Muller code, and the deletion probability $q$ is 1/2, then $x$ can be reconstructed, with high probability, from $\tilde{O}(n)$ many of its traces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a Schilder-type large deviation principle for sticky-reflected Brownian motion with boundary diffusion, both at the static and sample path level in the short-time limit. A sharp transition for the rate function occurs, depending on whether the tangential boundary diffusion is faster or slower than in the interior of the domain. The resulting intrinsic distance naturally gives rise to a novel optimal transport model, where motion and kinetic energy are treated differently in the interior and along the boundary.</description>

Abstract: Let $\gamma_{n}= O (\log^{-c}n)$ and let $\nu$ be the infinite product measure whose $n$-th marginal is Bernoulli$(1/2+\gamma_{n})$. We show that $c=1/2$ is the threshold, above which $\nu$-almost every point is simply Poisson generic in the sense of Peres-Weiss, and below which this can fail. This provides a range in which $\nu$ is singular with respect to the uniform product measure, but $\nu$-almost every point is simply Poisson generic.</description>

      <title>Non-Reversible Langevin Algorithms for Constrained Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from a target distribution on a constrained domain. We propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD), a continuous-time stochastic differential equation with skew-reflected boundary. We obtain non-asymptotic convergence rate of SRNLD to the target distribution in both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. By breaking reversibility, we show that the convergence is faster than the special case of the reversible dynamics. Based on the discretization of SRNLD, we propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC), and obtain non-asymptotic discretization error from SRNLD, and convergence guarantees to the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. We show better performance guarantees than the projected Langevin Monte Carlo in the literature that is based on the reversible dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided for both synthetic and real datasets to show efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Computation of Lyapunov exponents of matrix products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $m$ given square matrices $A_0, A_1, \cdots, A_{m-1}$ ($m\ge 2$), one of which is assumed to be of rank $1$, and for a given sequence $(\omega_n)$ in $\{0,1, \cdots, m-1\}^\mathbb{N}$, the following limit, if it exists, $$L(\omega):=\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac 1n \log \|A_{\omega_0} A_{\omega_2}\cdots A_{\omega_{n-1}}\|$$ defines the Lyapunov exponent of the sequence of matrices $(A_{\omega_n})_{n\ge 0}$. It is proved that the Lyapunov exponent $L(\omega)$ has a closed-form expression under certain conditions. One special case arises when $A_j$'s are non-negative and $\omega$ is generic with respect to some shift-invariant measure; a second special case occurs when $A_j$'s (for $1\le j&lt;m$) are invertible and $\omega$ is a typical point with respect to some shift-ergodic measure. Substitutive sequences and characteristic sequences of $\mathcal{B}$-free integers are considered as examples. An application is presented for the computation of multifractal spectrum of weighted Birkhoff averages.</description>

      <title>The random graph process is globally synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The homogeneous Kuramoto model on a graph $G = (V,E)$ is a network of $|V|$ identical oscillators, one at each vertex, where every oscillator is coupled bidirectionally (with unit strength) to its neighbors in the graph. A graph $G$ is said to be globally synchronizing if, for almost every initial condition, the homogeneous Kuramoto model converges to the all-in-phase synchronous state. Confirming a conjecture of Abdalla, Bandeira, Kassabov, Souza, Strogatz, and Townsend, we show that with high probability, the random graph process becomes globally synchronizing as soon as it is connected. This is best possible, since connectivity is a necessary condition for global synchronization.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Error Bounds for Scaling Limits of Stochastic Iterative Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic iterative algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), are widely utilized for optimization and sampling in large-scale and high-dimensional problems in machine learning, statistics, and engineering. Numerous works have bounded the parameter error in, and characterized the uncertainty of, these approximations. One common approach has been to use scaling limit analyses to relate the distribution of algorithm sample paths to a continuous-time stochastic process approximation, particularly in asymptotic setups. Focusing on the univariate setting, in this paper, we build on previous work to derive non-asymptotic functional approximation error bounds between the algorithm sample paths and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck approximation using an infinite-dimensional version of Stein's method of exchangeable pairs. We show that this bound implies weak convergence under modest additional assumptions and leads to a bound on the error of the variance of the iterate averages of the algorithm. Furthermore, we use our main result to construct error bounds in terms of two common metrics: the L\'{e}vy-Prokhorov and bounded Wasserstein distances. Our results provide a foundation for developing similar error bounds for the multivariate setting and for more sophisticated stochastic approximation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Colouring random Hasse diagrams and box-Delaunay graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix $d\ge2$ and consider a uniformly random set $P$ of $n$ points in $[0,1]^{d}$. Let $G$ be the Hasse diagram of $P$ (with respect to the coordinatewise partial order), or alternatively let $G$ be the Delaunay graph of $P$ with respect to axis-parallel boxes (where we put an edge between $u,v\in P$ whenever there is an axis-parallel box containing $u,v$ and no other points of $P$).
  In each of these two closely related settings, we show that the chromatic number of $G$ is typically $(\log n)^{d-1+o(1)}$ and the independence number of $G$ is typically $n/(\log n)^{d-1+o(1)}$. When $d=2$, we obtain bounds that are sharp up to constant factors: the chromatic number is typically of order $\log n/\log\log n$ and the independence number is typically of order $n\log\log n/\log n$.
  These results extend and sharpen previous bounds by Chen, Pach, Szegedy and Tardos. In addition, they provide new bounds on the largest possible chromatic number (and lowest possible independence number) of a $d$-dimensional box-Delaunay graph or Hasse diagram, in particular resolving a conjecture of Tomon.</description>

      <title>On the uniform Besov regularity of local times of general processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our main purpose is to use a new condition, $\alpha$-local nondeterminism, which is an alternative to the classical local nondeterminism usually utilized in the Gaussian framework, in order to investigate Besov regularity, in the time variable $t$ uniformly in the space variable $x$, for local times $L(x, t)$ of a class of continuous processes. We also extend the classical Adler's theorem [1, Theorem 8.7.1] to the Besov spaces case. These results are then exploited to study the Besov irregularity of the sample paths of the underlying processes. Based on similar known results in the case of the bifractional Brownian motion, we believe that our results are sharp. As applications, we get sharp Besov regularity results for some classical Gaussian processes and the solutions of systems of non-linear stochastic heat equations. The Besov regularity of their corresponding local times is also obtained.</description>

      <title>A quasi-stationary approach to the long-term asymptotics of the growth-fragmentation equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a growth-fragmentation system, cells grow in size slowly and split apart at random. Typically, the number of cells in the system grows exponentially and the distribution of the sizes of cells settles into an equilibrium 'asymptotic profile'. In this work we introduce a new method to prove this asymptotic behaviour for the growth-fragmentation equation, and show that the convergence to the asymptotic profile occurs at exponential rate. We do this by identifying an associated sub-Markov process and studying its quasi-stationary behaviour via a Lyapunov function condition. By doing so, we are able to simplify and generalise results in a number of common cases and offer a unified framework for their study. In the course of this work we are also able to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the growth-fragmentation equation in a wide range of situations.</description>

      <title>Local weak limits for collapsed branching processes with random out-degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain local weak limits in probability for Collapsed Branching Processes (CBP), which are directed random networks obtained by collapsing random-sized families of individuals in a general continuous-time branching process. The local weak limit of a given CBP, as the network grows, is shown to be a related continuous-time branching process stopped at an independent exponential time. The proof involves the construction of an explicit coupling of the in-components of vertices with the limiting object. We also show that the in-components of a finite collection of uniformly chosen vertices locally weakly converge (in probability) to i.i.d. copies of the above limit, reminiscent of propagation of chaos in interacting particle systems. We obtain as special cases novel descriptions of the local weak limits of directed preferential and uniform attachment models. We also outline some applications of our results for analyzing the limiting in-degree and PageRank distributions. In particular, upper and lower bounds on the tail of the in-degree distribution are obtained and a phase transition is detected in terms of the growth rate of the attachment function governing reproduction rates in the branching process.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness, exponential ergodicity and numerical approximation of fully super-linear McKean--Vlasov SDEs and associated particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05133v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDEs) with drifts and diffusions having super-linear growth in measure and space -- the maps have general polynomial form but also satisfy a certain monotonicity condition. The combination of the drift's super-linear growth in measure (by way of a convolution) and the super-linear growth in space and measure of the diffusion coefficient requires novel technical elements in order to obtain the main results. We establish wellposedness, propagation of chaos (PoC), and under further assumptions on the model parameters, we show an exponential ergodicity property alongside the existence of an invariant distribution. No differentiability or non-degeneracy conditions are required.
  Further, we present a particle system based Euler-type split-step scheme (SSM) for the simulation of this type of MV-SDEs. The scheme attains, in stepsize, the strong error rate $1/2$ in the non-path-space root-mean-square error metric and we demonstrate the property of mean-square contraction. Our results are illustrated by numerical examples including: estimation of PoC rates across dimensions, preservation of periodic phase-space, and the observation that taming appears to be not a suitable method unless strong dissipativity is present.</description>

      <title>Shattering in Pure Spherical Spin Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04659v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a shattered phase within the replica-symmetric phase of the pure spherical $p$-spin models for $p$ sufficiently large.
  In this phase, we construct a decomposition of the sphere into well-separated small clusters, each of which has exponentially small Gibbs mass, yet which together carry all but an exponentially small fraction of the Gibbs mass.
  We achieve this via quantitative estimates on the derivative of the Franz--Parisi potential, which measures the Gibbs mass profile around a typical sample. Corollaries on dynamics are derived, in particular we show the two-times correlation function of stationary Langevin dynamics must have an exponentially long plateau. We further show that shattering implies disorder chaos for the Gibbs measure in the optimal transport sense; this is known to imply failure of sampling algorithms which are stable under perturbation in the same metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09086v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a unique Malliavin differentiable strong solution to a stochastic differential equation on the plane with merely integrable coefficients driven by the fractional Brownian sheet with Hurst parameters less than 1/2. The proof of this result relies on a compactness criterion for square integrable Wiener functionals from Malliavin calculus ([Da Prato, Malliavin and Nualart, 1992]), variational techniques developed in the case of fractional Brownian motion ([Ba\~nos, Nielssen, and Proske, 2020]) and the concept of sectorial local nondeterminism (introduced in [Khoshnevisan and Xiao, 2007]). The latter concept enable us to improve the bound of the Hurst parameter (compare with [Ba\~nos, Nielssen, and Proske, 2020]).</description>

      <title>The friendship paradox for sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15105v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G_n$ be an undirected finite graph on $n\in\mathbb{N}$ vertices labelled by $[n] = \{1,\ldots,n\}$. For $i \in [n]$, let $\Delta_{i,n}$ be the friendship bias of vertex $i$, defined as the difference between the average degree of the neighbours of vertex $i$ and the degree of vertex $i$ itself when $i$ is not isolated, and zero when $i$ is isolated. Let $\mu_n$ denote the friendship-bias empirical distribution, i.e., the measure that puts mass $\frac{1}{n}$ at each $\Delta_{i,n}$, $i \in [n]$. The friendship paradox says that $\int_{\mathbb{R}} x\mu_n(\mathrm{d}x) \geq 0$, with equality if and only if in each connected component of $G_n$ all the degrees are the same.
  We show that if $(G_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of sparse random graphs that converges to a rooted random tree in the sense of convergence locally in probability, then $\mu_n$ converges weakly to a limiting measure $\mu$ that is expressible in terms of the law of the rooted random tree. We study $\mu$ for four classes of sparse random graphs: the homogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, the inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, the configuration model and the preferential attachment model. In particular, we compute the first two moments of $\mu$, identify the right tail of $\mu$, and argue that $\mu([0,\infty))\geq\tfrac{1}{2}$, a property we refer to as friendship paradox significance.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the asymptotic behavior of $U$-statistics on row-column exchangeable matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $U$-statistics on row-column exchangeable matrices. We present a new decomposition based on orthogonal projections onto probability spaces generated by sets of Aldous-Hoover-Kallenberg variables. These sets are indexed by bipartite graphs, enabling the application of graph-theoretic concepts to describe the decomposition. This framework provides new insights into the characterization of $U$-statistics on row-column exchangeable matrices, particularly their asymptotic behavior, including in degenerate cases. Notably, the limit distribution depends only on specific terms in the decomposition, corresponding to non-zero components indexed by the smallest graphs, namely the principal support graphs. We show that the asymptotic behavior of a $U$-statistic is characterized by the properties of its principal support graphs. The number of nodes in these graphs dictates the convergence rate to the limit distribution, with degeneracy occurring if and only if this number is strictly greater than 1. Furthermore, when the principal support graphs are connected, the limit distribution is Gaussian, even in degenerate cases. Applications to network analysis illustrate these findings.</description>

For the particular case of solutions to a stochastic Volterra equation, we also obtain the one-dimensional distributions' regularity and study the finite-dimensional distributions' absolute continuity. Finally, based on the previously shown regularity of the self-intersection measure, we prove the existence, uniqueness and stability of stochastic equations with distributional drifts of "self-intersection" type in terms of corresponding two-parameter nonlinear Young equations.</description>

      <title>Outliers and bounded rank perturbation for non-Hermitian random band matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider general non-Hermitian square random matrices $X$ that include a wide class of random band matrices with independent entries. Whereas the existence of limiting density is largely unknown for these inhomogeneous models, we show that spectral outliers can be determined under very general conditions when perturbed by a finite rank deterministic matrix. More precisely, we show that whenever $\mathbb{E}[X]=0,\mathbb{E}[XX^*]=\mathbb{E}[X^*X]=\mathbf{1}$ and $\mathbb{E}[X^2]=\rho\mathbf{1}$, and under mild conditions on sparsity and entry moments of $X$, then with high possibility all eigenvalues of $X$ are confined in a neighborhood of the support of the elliptic law with parameter $\rho$. Also, a finite rank perturbation property holds: when $X$ is perturbed by another deterministic matrix $C_N$ with bounded rank, then the perturbation induces outlying eigenvalues whose limit depends only on outlying eigenvalues of $C_N$ and $\rho$. This extends the result of Tao on i.i.d. random matrices and O'rourke and Renfrew on elliptic matrices to a family of highly sparse and inhomogeneous random matrices, including all Gaussian band matrices on regular graphs with degree at least $(\log N)^3$. A quantitative convergence rate is also derived. We also consider a class of finite rank deformations of products of at least two independent elliptic random matrices, and show it behaves just as product i.i.d. matrices.</description>

Abstract: For the stochastic six-vertex model on the quadrant $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}\times\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}$ with step initial conditions and a single second-class particle at the origin, we show almost sure convergence of the speed of the second-class particle to a random limit. This allows us to define the stochastic six-vertex speed process, whose law we show to be ergodic and stationary for the dynamics of the multi-class stochastic six-vertex process. The proof follows the scheme developed in [ACG23] for ASEP and requires the development of precise bounds on the fluctuations of the height function of the stochastic six-vertex model around its limit shape using methods from integrable probability. As part of the proof, we also obtain a novel geometric stochastic domination result that states that a second-class particle to the right of any number of third-class particles will at any fixed time be overtaken by at most a geometric number of third-class particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent progress on the study of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in a periodic setting, which describes the random growth of an interface in a cylindrical geometry. The main results include central limit theorems for the height of the interface and the winding number of the directed polymer in a periodic random environment. We present two different approaches for each result, utilizing either a homogenization argument or tools from Malliavin calculus. A surprising finding in the case of a $1+1$ spacetime white noise is that the effective variances for both the height and the winding number can be expressed in terms of independent Brownian bridges.
  Additionally, we present two new results: (i) the explicit expression of the corrector used in the homogenization argument, and (ii) the law of the iterated logarithm for the height function.</description>

      <title>Analytically weak and mild solutions to stochastic heat equation with irregular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the stochastic heat equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u_t(x)=\frac12 \partial^2_{xx}u_t(x) +b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x),\quad t\in(0,T],\, x\in D, \end{equation*} where $b$ is a generalized function, $D$ is either $[0,1]$ or $\mathbb{R}$, and $\dot W$ is space-time white noise on $\mathbb{R}_+\times D$. If the drift $b$ is a sufficiently regular function, then it is well-known that any analytically weak solution to this equation is also analytically mild, and vice versa. We extend this result to drifts that are generalized functions, with an appropriate adaptation of the notions of mild and weak solutions. As a corollary of our results, we show that for $b\in L_p(\mathbb{R})$, $p\ge1$, this equation has a unique analytically weak and mild solution, thus extending the classical results of Gy\"ongy and Pardoux (1993).</description>

      <title>On the maximal correlation of some stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the maximal correlation coefficient $R(X,Y)$ between two stochastic processes $X$ and $Y$. When $(X,Y)$ is a random walk, the result is a consequence of Cs\'{a}ki-Fischer identity and lower-semi continuity of $\text{Law}(X,Y)\to R(X,Y)$. When $(X,Y)$ are two-dimensional L\'{e}vy processes, we give an expression of $R(X,Y)$ via the covariance $\Sigma$ and the L\'{e}vy measure $\nu$ appeared in the L\'{e}vy-Khinchine formula. As a consequence, for two-dimensional $\alpha$-stable random variables $(X,Y)$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$, we give an expression of $R(X,Y)$ via the stability index $\alpha$ and the spectral measure $\tau$ of the $\alpha$-stable distribution. We also prove analogs and generalizations of Dembo-Kagan-Shepp-Yu inequality and Madiman-Barron inequality. Roughly speaking, we investigate the maximal correlation coefficient between two random selected "subvectors" $Y$ and $Z$ of a common random vector $X$. Besides, by using above new results, we recover several classical results.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-expansion of the measure-current large deviations rate functional of non-reversible finite-state Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a sequence of continuous-time Markov chains $(X^{(n)}_t:t\ge 0)$ evolving on a fixed finite state space $V$. Let $I_n$ be the measure-current large deviations rate functional for $X^{(n)}_t$, as $t\to\infty$. Under a hypothesis on the jump rates, we prove that $I_n$ can be written as $I_n = \mathbf I^{(0)} \,+\, \sum_{1\le p\le \mathfrak q} (1/\theta^{(p)}_n) \, \mathbf I^{(p)}$ for some rate functionals $\mathbf I^{(p)}$. The weights $\theta^{(p)}_n$ correspond to the time-scales at which the sequence of Markov chains $X^{(n)}_t$ evolves among the metastable wells, and the rate functionals $\mathbf I^{(p)}$ characterise the asymptotic Markovian dynamics among these wells. This expansion provides therefore an alternative description of the metastable behavior of a sequence of Markovian dynamics. Together with the results in \cite{bgl-24,l-gamma}, this work finishes the project of characterising the hierarchical metastable behavior of finite-state Markov chains by means of the $\Gamma$-expansion of large deviations rate functionals. In addition, we present optimal conditions under which the measure (Donsker-Varadhan) or the measure-current large deviations rate functional determines the original dynamics, and calculate the first and second derivatives of the measure large deviations rate functional, thereby generalising the results for i.i.d. random variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study inhomogeneous random graphs with a finite type space. For a natural generalization of the model as a dynamic network-valued process, the paper establishes the following results:
  (a) Functional central limit theorems for the infinite vector of microscopic type-densities and characterizations of the limits as infinite-dimensional conditionally Gaussian processes in a certain Banach space.
  (b) Functional (joint) central limit theorems for macroscopic observables of the giant component in the supercritical regime including size, surplus and number of vertices of various types in the giant component. As a corollary this provides central limit theorems for the size of the largest connected component, its surplus, and its type vector, for percolation on dense graphs obtained from a finite type Graphon.
  (c) Central limit theorem for the weight of the minimum spanning tree with random i.i.d. Exponential edge weights on dense graph sequences driven by an underlying finite type graphon.</description>

      <title>The smallest singular value of large random rectangular Toeplitz and circulant matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $x_i$, $i\in\mathbb{Z}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. standard normal random variables. Consider rectangular Toeplitz $\mathbf{X}=\left(x_{j-i}\right)_{1\leq i\leq p,1\leq j\leq n}$ and circulant $\mathbf{X}=\left(x_{(j-i)\mod n}\right)_{1\leq i\leq p,1\leq j\leq n}$ matrices. Let $p,n\rightarrow\infty$ so that $p/n\rightarrow c\in(0,1]$. We prove that the smallest eigenvalue of $\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^\top$ converges to zero in probability and in expectation. We establish a lower bound on the rate of this convergence. The lower bound is faster than any poly-log but slower than any polynomial rate. For the ``rectangular circulant'' matrices, we also establish a polynomial upper bound on the convergence rate, which is a simple explicit function of $c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the long-range random field Ising model in dimension $d = 1, 2$, whereas the long-range interaction is of the form $J_{xy} = |x-y|^{-\alpha}$ with $1&lt; \alpha &lt; 3/2$ for $d=1$ and with $2 &lt; \alpha \leq 3$ for $d = 2$. Our main results establish phase transitions in these regimes. In one dimension, we employ a Peierls argument with some novel modification, suitable for dealing with the randomness coming from the external field; in two dimensions, our proof follows that of Affonso, Bissacot, and Maia (2023) with some adaptations, but new ideas are required in the critical case of $\alpha=3$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the globally modified stochastic (hyperviscous) Navier-Stokes equations with transport noise on 3D torus. We first establish the existence and pathwise uniqueness of the weak solutions, and then show their convergence to the solutions of the deterministic 3D globally modified (hyperviscous) Navier-Stokes equations in an appropriate scaling limit. Furthermore, we prove a large deviation principle for the stochastic globally modified hyperviscous system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a formal definition of the concept of probability tree and conduct a detailed and comprehensive study of its fundamental structural properties. In particular, we define what we term an inductive probability measure and prove that such trees can be identified with these measures. Furthermore, we prove that probability trees are completely determined by probability measures on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of the tree's body.
  We then explore applications of probability trees in several areas of mathematics, including probability theory, measure theory, and set theory. In the first, we show that the cumulative distribution of finitely many dependent and non-identically distributed Bernouli tests is bounded by the cumulative distribution of some binomial distribution. In the second, we establish a close relationship between probability trees and the real line, showing that Borel, measurable sets, and their measures can be preserved, as well as other combinatorial properties. Finally, in set theory, we establish that the null ideal associated with suitable probability trees is Tukey equivalent to the null ideal on $[0, 1]$. This leads to a new elementary proof of the fact that the null ideal of a free $\sigma$-finite Borel measure on a Polish space is Tukey equivalent with the null ideal of $\mathbb{R}$, which supports that the associated cardinal characteristics remain invariant across the spaces in which they are defined.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the convergence of new Carath\'eodory's approximate solution for one-dimensional $\alpha, \beta$-doubly perturbed stochastic differential equations (DPSDEs) with parameters $\alpha &lt;1$ and $\beta &lt;1$ such that $|\rho| &lt; 1$, where $ \rho : = \frac{\alpha\beta}{(1-\alpha)(1-\beta)}$. Under Lipschitz's condition on the coefficients, we establish the $L^{p}$-convergence of the Carath\'eodory approximate solution uniformly in time, for all $p\geq 2$. As a consequence, and relying only on our scheme, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of strong solution for $\alpha, \beta$-DPSDEs. Furthermore, an extension to non-Lipschitz coefficients are also studied. Our results improve earlier work by Mao and al. (2018).</description>

      <title>A Girsanov approach to slow parameterizing manifolds in the presence of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.08598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a three-dimensional slow-fast stochastic system with quadratic nonlinearity and additive noise, inspired by fluid dynamics. The deterministic counterpart exhibits a periodic orbit and a slow manifold. We demonstrate that, under specific parameter regimes, this deterministic slow manifold can serve as an approximate parameterization of the fast variable by the slow variables within the stochastic system.
  Building upon this parameterization, we derive a two-dimensional reduced model, a stochastic Hopf normal form, that captures the essential dynamics of the original system. Both the original and the reduced systems possess ergodic invariant measures, characterizing their long-term behavior.
  We quantify the discrepancy between the original system and its slow approximation by deriving error estimates involving the Wasserstein distance between the marginals of these invariant measures along the radial component. These error bounds are shown to be controlled by a parameterization defect, which measures the quality of the fast-slow variable parameterization.
  A key technical innovation lies in the application of Girsanov's theorem to obtain these error estimates in the presence of oscillatory instabilities. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to regimes exhibiting an "inverted" timescale separation, where the variable to be parameterized evolves on a slower timescale than the resolved variables. To address these more challenging scenarios, we introduce path-dependent coefficients in the parameterizing manifold, enabling the derivation of robust error bounds for the corresponding reduced model. Numerical simulations complement our theoretical findings, providing insights into the model's behavior and exploring parameter regimes beyond the scope of our analytical results.</description>

Abstract: We prove a general criterion providing sufficient conditions under which a time-discretiziation of a given Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is a uniform in time approximation of the SDE. The criterion is also, to a certain extent, discussed in the paper, necessary. Using such a criterion we then analyse the convergence properties of numerical methods for solutions of SDEs; we consider Explicit and Implicit Euler, split-step and (truncated) tamed Euler methods. In particular, we show that, under mild conditions on the coefficients of the SDE (locally Lipschitz and strictly monotonic), these methods produce approximations of the law of the solution of the SDE that converge uniformly in time. The theoretical results are verified by numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the mean-field Markov decision process (MDP) with the centralized stopping under the non-exponential discount. The problem differs fundamentally from most existing studies on mean-field optimal control/stopping due to its time inconsistency by nature. We look for the subgame perfect relaxed equilibria, namely the randomized stopping policies that satisfy the time-consistent planning with future selves from the perspective of the social planner. On the other hand, unlike many previous studies on time-inconsistent stopping where the decreasing impatience plays a key role, we are interested in the general discount function without imposing any conditions. As a result, the study on the relaxed equilibrium becomes necessary as the pure-strategy equilibrium may not exist in general. We formulate relaxed equilibria as fixed points of a complicated operator, whose existence is challenging by a direct method. To overcome the obstacles, we first introduce the auxiliary problem under the entropy regularization on the randomized policy and the discount function, and establish the existence of the regularized equilibria as fixed points to an auxiliary operator via Schauder fixed point theorem. Next, we show that the regularized equilibrium converges as the regularization parameter $\lambda$ tends to $0$ and the limit corresponds to a fixed point to the original operator, and hence is a relaxed equilibrium. We also establish some connections between the mean-field MDP and the N-agent MDP when $N$ is sufficiently large in our time-inconsistent setting.</description>

      <title>A multistate approach to disability insurance reserving with information delays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disability insurance claims are often affected by lengthy reporting delays and adjudication processes. The classic multistate life insurance modeling framework is ill-suited to handle such information delays since the cash flow and available information can no longer be based on the biometric multistate process determining the contractual payments. We propose a new individual reserving model for disability insurance schemes which describes the claim evolution in real-time. Under suitable independence assumptions between the available information and the underlying biometric multistate process, we show that these new reserves may be calculated as natural modifications of the classic reserves. We propose suitable parametric estimators for the model constituents and a real data application shows the practical relevance of our concepts and results.</description>

Abstract: A minimal surface in a random environment (MSRE) is a surface which minimizes the sum of its elastic energy and its environment potential energy, subject to prescribed boundary conditions. Apart from their intrinsic interest, such surfaces are further motivated by connections with disordered spin systems and first-passage percolation models. We wish to study the geometry of $d$-dimensional minimal surfaces in a $(d+n)$-dimensional random environment. Specializing to a model that we term harmonic MSRE, in an ``independent'' random environment, we rigorously establish bounds on the geometric and energetic fluctuations of the minimal surface, as well as versions of the scaling relation $\chi=2\xi+d-2$ that ties together these two types of fluctuations. In particular, we prove, for all values of $n$, that the surfaces are delocalized in dimensions $d\le 4$ and localized in dimensions $d\ge 5$. Moreover, the surface delocalizes with power-law fluctuations when $d\le 3$ and sub-power-law fluctuations when $d=4$. Our localization results apply also to harmonic minimal surfaces in a periodic random environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stochastic damped Burgers equation with multiplicative space-time white noise defined on the entire real line. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution of the stochastic damped Burgers equation in the weighted space and establish that the solution is bounded in probability. Furthermore, by using the Krylov-Bogolioubov theorem, we obtain the existence of invariant measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a Galton-Watson tree with a given offspring distribution $\xi$, where $\xi$ is a $Z_{\geq 0}$-valued random variable with $E[\xi] = 1$ and $0 &lt; \sigma^{2}:=Var[\xi] &lt; \infty$. For $n \geq 1$, let $T_{n}$ be the tree $\mathcal{T}$ conditioned to have $n$ vertices. In this paper we investigate $b(T_n)$, the burning number of $T_n$. Our main result shows that asymptotically almost surely $b(T_n)$ is of the order of $n^{1/3}$.</description>

      <title>Contraction properties and differentiability of $p$-energy forms with applications to nonlinear potential theory on self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new contraction property, which we call the generalized $p$-contraction property, for $p$-energy forms as generalizations of many well-known inequalities, such as $p$-Clarkson's inequality, the strong subadditivity and the Markov property in the theory of nonlinear Dirichlet forms, and show that any $p$-energy form satisfying $p$-Clarkson's inequality is Fr\'{e}chet differentiable. We also verify the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms on fractals constructed by Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and by Cao--Gu--Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517]. As a general framework of $p$-energy forms taking the generalized $p$-contraction property into consideration, we introduce the notion of $p$-resistance form and investigate fundamental properties of $p$-harmonic functions with respect to $p$-resistance forms. In particular, some new estimates on scaling factors of self-similar $p$-energy forms on self-similar sets are obtained by establishing H\"{o}lder regularity estimates for $p$-harmonic functions, and the $p$-walk dimensions of any generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet and the $D$-dimensional level-$l$ Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket are shown to be strictly greater than $p$.</description>

      <title>Approximating particle-based clustering dynamics by stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) as a practical tool to replicate clustering effects of more detailed particle-based dynamics. Inspired by membrane-mediated receptor dynamics on cell surfaces, we formulate a stochastic particle-based model for diffusion and pairwise interaction of particles, leading to intriguing clustering phenomena. Employing numerical simulation and cluster detection methods, we explore the approximation of the particle-based clustering dynamics through mean-field approaches. We find that SPDEs successfully reproduce spatiotemporal clustering dynamics, not only in the initial cluster formation period, but also on longer time scales where the successive merging of clusters cannot be tracked by deterministic mean-field models. The computational efficiency of the SPDE approach allows us to generate extensive statistical data for parameter estimation in a simpler model that uses a Markov jump process to capture the temporal evolution of the cluster number.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence for mean field control with common noise and degenerate idiosyncratic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the convergence problem in the setting of mean field control with common noise and degenerate idiosyncratic noise. Our main results establish a rate of convergence of the finite-dimensional value functions $V^N$ towards the mean field value function $U$. In the case that the idiosyncratic noise is constant (but possibly degenerate), we obtain the rate $N^{-1/(d+7)}$, which is close to the conjectured optimal rate $N^{-1/d}$, and improves on the existing literature even in the non-degenerate setting. In the case that the idiosyncratic noise can be both non-constant and degenerate, the argument is more complicated, and we instead find the rate $N^{-1/(3d + 19)}$. Our proof strategy builds on the one initiated in [Daudin, Delarue, Jackson - JFA, 2024] in the case of non-degenerate idiosyncratic noise and zero common noise, which consists of approximating $U$ by more regular functions which are almost subsolutions of the infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equation solved by $U$. Because of the different noise structure, several new steps are necessary in order to produce an appropriate mollification scheme. In addition to our main convergence results, we investigate the case of zero idiosyncratic noise, and show that sharper results can be obtained there by purely control-theoretic arguments. We also provide examples to demonstrate that the value function is sensitive to the choice of admissible controls in the zero noise setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotent function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``continued fraction mixing'' measure for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotent function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are via the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type theorem for Diophantine approximation with respect to ``weak Renyi measures'' which are ``doubling at $0$''.</description>

      <title>Are Bayesian networks typically faithful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Faithfulness is a ubiquitous assumption in causal inference, often motivated by the fact that the faithful parameters of linear Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks are typical, and the folklore belief that this should also hold for other classes of Bayesian networks. We address this open question by showing that among all Bayesian networks over a given DAG, the faithful Bayesian networks are indeed `typical': they constitute a dense, open set with respect to the total variation metric. However, this does not imply that faithfulness is typical in restricted classes of Bayesian networks, as are often considered in statistical applications. To this end we consider the class of Bayesian networks parametrised by conditional exponential families, for which we show that under mild regularity conditions, the faithful parameters constitute a dense, open set and the unfaithful parameters have Lebesgue measure zero, extending the existing results for linear Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks. Finally, we show that the aforementioned results also hold for Bayesian networks with latent variables.</description>

      <title>Zero-Coupon Treasury Rates and Returns using the Volatility Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03699v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multivariate autoregressive stochastic volatility model for the first 3 principal components (level, slope, curvature) of 10 series of zero-coupon Treasury bond rates with maturities from 1 to 10 years. We fit this model using monthly data from 1990. Unlike classic models with hidden stochastic volatility, here it is observed as VIX: the volatility index for the S&amp;P 500 stock market index. Surprisingly, this stock index volatility works for Treasury bonds, too. Next, we prove long-term stability and the Law of Large Numbers. We express total returns of zero-coupon bonds using these principal components. We prove the Law of Large Numbers for these returns. All results are done for discrete and continuous time.</description>

      <title>Spectral Property of Magnetic Quantum Walk on Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk on a general hypercube. We first construct a set of unitary involutions associated with a magnetic potential $\nu$ by using quantum Bernoulli noises. And then, with these unitary involutions as the magnetic shift operators, we define the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ for the model, where $\nu$ is the magnetic potential. We examine the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ and obtain their representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We show that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ are completely independent of the magnetic potential $\nu$ although $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\nu$. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic control problem with regime switching arising in an optimal liquidation problem with dark pools and multiple regimes. The new feature of this model is that it introduces a system of BSDEs with jumps and with singular terminal values, which appears in literature for the first time. The existence result for this system is obtained. As a result, we solve the stochastic control problem with regime switching. More importantly, the uniqueness result of this system is also obtained, in contrast to merely minimal solutions established in most related literature.</description>

      <title>Sequential Portfolio Selection under Latent Side Information-Dependence Structure: Optimality and Universal Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the investment problem of constructing an optimal no-short sequential portfolio strategy in a market with a latent dependence structure between asset prices and partly unobservable side information, which is often high-dimensional. The results demonstrate that a dynamic strategy, which forms a portfolio based on perfect knowledge of the dependence structure and full market information over time, may not grow at a higher rate infinitely often than a constant strategy, which remains invariant over time. Specifically, if the market is stationary, implying that the dependence structure is statistically stable, the growth rate of an optimal dynamic strategy, utilizing the maximum capacity of the entire market information, almost surely decays over time into an equilibrium state, asymptotically converging to the growth rate of a constant strategy.
  Technically, this work reassesses the common belief that a constant strategy only attains the optimal limiting growth rate of dynamic strategies when the market process is identically and independently distributed. By analyzing the dynamic log-optimal portfolio strategy as the optimal benchmark in a stationary market with side information, we show that a random optimal constant strategy almost surely exists, even when a limiting growth rate for the dynamic strategy does not. Consequently, two approaches to learning algorithms for portfolio construction are discussed, demonstrating the safety of removing side information from the learning process while still guaranteeing an asymptotic growth rate comparable to that of the optimal dynamic strategy.</description>

      <title>Predicting the depth of the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ species: the impact of phylogenetic tree shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following question: how close to the ancestral root of a phylogenetic tree is the most recent common ancestor of $k$ species randomly sampled from the tips of the tree? For trees having shapes predicted by the Yule-Harding model, it is known that the most recent common ancestor is likely to be close to (or equal to) the root of the full tree, even as $n$ becomes large (for $k$ fixed). However, this result does not extend to models of tree shape that more closely describe phylogenies encountered in evolutionary biology. We investigate the impact of tree shape (via the Aldous $\beta-$splitting model) to predict the number of edges that separate the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ tip species and the root of the parent tree they are sampled from. Both exact and asymptotic results are presented. We also briefly consider a variation of the process in which a random number of tip species are sampled.</description>
