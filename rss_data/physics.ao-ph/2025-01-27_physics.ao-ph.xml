      <title>Coupled Seasonal Data Assimilation of Sea Ice, Ocean, and Atmospheric Dynamics over the Last Millennium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Online" data assimilation (DA) is used to generate a new seasonal-resolution reanalysis dataset over the last millennium by combining forecasts from an ocean--atmosphere--sea-ice coupled linear inverse model with climate proxy records. Instrumental verification reveals that this reconstruction achieves the highest correlation skill, while using fewer proxies, in surface temperature reconstructions compared to other paleo-DA products, particularly during boreal winter when proxy data are scarce. Reconstructed ocean and sea-ice variables also have high correlation with instrumental and satellite datasets. Verification against independent proxy records shows that reconstruction skill is robust throughout the last millennium. Analysis of the results reveals that the method effectively captures the seasonal evolution and amplitude of El Ni\~{n}o events. Reconstructed seasonal temperature variations are consistent with trends in orbital forcing over the last millennium.</description>

      <title>Causal pathway from AMOC to Southern Amazon rainforest indicates stabilising interaction between two climate tipping elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Declines in resilience have been observed in several climate tipping elements over the past decades, including the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Amazon rainforest (AR). Large-scale nonlinear and possibly irreversible changes in system state, such as AMOC weakening or rainforest-savanna transitions in the Amazon basin, would have severe impacts on ecosystems and human societies worldwide. In order to improve future tipping risk assessments, understanding interactions between tipping elements is crucial. The AMOC is known to influence the Intertropical Convergence Zone, potentially altering precipitation patterns over the AR and affecting its stability. However, AMOC-AR interactions are currently not well understood. Here, we identify a previously unknown stabilising interaction pathway from the AMOC onto the Southern AR, applying an established causal discovery and inference approach to tipping element interactions for the first time. Analysing observational and reanalysis data from 1982-2022, we show that AMOC weakening leads to increased precipitation in the Southern AR during the critical dry season, in line with findings from recent Earth system model experiments. Specifically, we report a 4.8% increase of mean dry season precipitation in the Southern AR for every 1 Sv of AMOC weakening. This finding is consistent across multiple data sources and AMOC strength indices. We show that this stabilising interaction has offset 17% of dry season precipitation decrease in the Southern AR since 1982. Our results demonstrate the potential of causal discovery methods for analysing tipping element interactions based on reanalysis and observational data. By improving the understanding of AMOC-AR interactions, we contribute toward better constraining the risk of potential climate tipping cascades under global warming.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the plutonium isotopic composition of a sediment core from Palomares, Spain, by low-energy AMS and alpha-spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of plutonium isotopes, 239Pu and 240Pu, at 670 kV on the compact accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) system at the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Seville, Spain, is now a reality. In this work, we present first Pu AMS results for environmental samples: a sediment core collected in a submarine canyon in the Mediterranean coast of the Spanish region of Palomares, affected by a nuclear accident in 1966. From the study of the 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio profile, showing on average levels lower than 11%, we confirm that the weapon-grade plutonium released on land during the accident, with a characteristic 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio of 5.8%, has found its way into the marine environment. A two-plutonium sources mixture model (Palomares and fallout) is used to elucidate the percentage of the plutonium coming from the accident. As a validation exercise of the Pu AMS measuring technique and in order to obtain the 238Pu/(239+240)Pu activity ratios, samples were also studied by alpha-spectrometry (AS). The obtained AS 239+240Pu activity concentration results fit in with the AMS ones in a wide dynamic range, thus validating the AMS technique.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Stability of Partially and Fully Saturated Atmospheres to Moist Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a linear analysis of a minimal model of moist convection under a variety of atmospheric conditions. The stationary solutions that we analyze include both fully saturated and partially unsaturated atmospheres in both unconditionally and conditionally unstable cases. We find that all of the solutions we consider are linearly unstable via exchange of stability when sufficiently driven. The critical Rayleigh numbers vary by over an order of magnitude between unconditionally unstable and conditionally unstable atmospheres. The unsaturated atmospheres are notable for the presence of linear gravity wave-like oscillations even in unstable conditions. We study their eigenfunction structure and find that the buoyancy and moisture perturbations are anticorrelated in $z$, such that regions of negative buoyancy have positive moisture content. We suggest that these features in unsaturated atmospheres may explain the phenomenon of gravity wave shedding by moist convective plumes.</description>
