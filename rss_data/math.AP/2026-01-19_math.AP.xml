      <title>Critical points of the two-dimensional Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional with convergence of the phase-field energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family $\{(u_\varepsilon, v_\varepsilon)\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$ of critical points of the Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional. Assuming a uniform energy bound, the sequence $\{(u_\varepsilon, v_\varepsilon)\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$ converges in $L^2(\Omega)$ to a limit $(u, 1)$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$, where $u$ is in $SBV^2(\Omega)$. It was previously shown that if the full Ambrosio-Tortorelli energy associated to $(u_\varepsilon,v_\varepsilon)$ converges to the Mumford-Shah energy of $u$, then the first inner variation converges as well. In particular, $u$ is a critical point of the Mumford-Shah functional in the sense of inner variations. In this work, focusing on the two-dimensional setting, we extend this result under the sole convergence of the phase-field energy to the length energy term in the Mumford-Shah functional.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions of Nehari-Pankov type to indefinite variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider abstract nonlinear equations of the form $A u = \lambda u + I'(u)$, where $A$ is a self-adjoint operator with compact resolvent on a Hilbert space $H$, $\lambda \in \mathbf{R}$ is a parameter, and $u \mapsto I'(u)$ is a superlinear term of variational nature. In this abstract setting, we develop a new approach to existence and multiplicity of solutions with prescribed norm in $H$. We then consider various applications of this approach. First, we obtain, under fairly general assumptions including the mass-supercritical case, the existence of infinitely many solutions to a class of nonlinear (time-independent) Schr\"odinger equations on a compact graph $\mathcal{G}$ with prescribed (arbitrarily large) mass. Moreover, we derive a similar existence and multiplicity result for a biharmonic semilinear equation in the $2$-torus. For a larger class of second order and higher order equations in a bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions, we also show the existence of multiple solutions with prescribed small mass.
  The solutions we obtain are detected as ground states of Nehari-Pankov type for the associated $\lambda$-dependent action functional, where $\lambda$ varies in a spectral gap between sufficiently large eigenvalues of $A$. The key observation in this abstract framework is the fact that the $H$-norms of these $\lambda$-dependent solution families form connected sets. To estimate the size of these connected sets in specific settings, we use Weyl type estimates for the length of spectral gaps, variational characterizations of eigenvalues, bounds for associated eigenfunctions and a classical bound from analytic number theory.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spectral Problem With Low Regularity Refractive Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the unique determination of a radial refractive index n from spectral data. First, we demonstrate that for piecewise twice continuously differentiable functions, n is not uniquely determined by the special transmission eigenvalues associated with radially symmetric eigenfunctions. Subsequently we prove that if n \in M is twice continuously differentiable functions(or continuously differentiable functions with Lipschitz continuous derivative), then n is uniquely determined on [0,1] by all special transmission eigenvalues when supplemented by partial a priori information on the refractive index.</description>

      <title>On a Mullins-Sekerka model for the growth of active droplets modelling protocells: Stability analysis and numerical computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mullins-Sekerka models with chemical reactions can lead to scenarios where droplets grow, become unstable, split, grow and undergo further division. These grow and division cycles have been proposed as a model for protocells and are believed to play a fundamental role in living systems by providing chemical compartments which are important in the organization of living systems. This paper analyses chemically active Mullins-Sekerka models. Existence of radially symmetric solutions is shown and a detailed stability analysis in radial as well as planar situations is given. In particular, we also analyze multilayered solutions leading to shell-type situations. Finally, we introduce a numerical method based on a parametric finite element approach that explicitly accounts for topological changes, thereby allowing for droplet splitting and merging. Several numerical simulations verify the findings of the theoretical stability analysis and show complex dynamical behavior, including multiple instabilities, splittings of droplets and appearance of shell-type solutions.</description>

      <title>Ergodic pairs for fractional Hamilton-Jacobi equations on bounded domains: large solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the ergodic problem associated to viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation where the diffusion is governed by the censored fractional Laplacian, a nonlocal elliptic operator restricted to a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$. We restrict ourselves to the case in which the nonlinear gradient term has a scaling less or equal than the fractional order of the diffusion. In similarity to its second-order counterpart, we provide existence of ergodic pairs involving solutions that blow-up on $\partial \Omega$. We use the celebrated vanishing discount method, where the analysis of the approximated solutions have its own interest, leading to qualitative properties for the ergodic problem such as precise blow-up rates for the solution and characterization of the ergodic constant. The main difficulties arise from the state-dependency of the operator, from which the arguments of the local case based on well-known invariance properties of the Laplacian are not longer at disposal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of structured deformations to the setting of linearized elasticity by providing an integral representation for the underlying energy that features bulk and surface contributions. Our derivation is obtained both via a direct approach by means of a global method for relaxation in BD and via an approximation from nonlinear elastic energies associated to {nonsimple} materials.</description>

      <title>Elastic Calder\'on Problem via Resonant Hard Inclusions: Linearisation of the N-D Map and Density Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an elastic Calderon-type inverse problem: recover the mass density $\rho(x)$ in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ from the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map associated with the isotropic Lam\'e system $\mathcal{L}_{\lambda,\mu}u+\omega^2\rho(x)u=0$. We introduce a constructive strategy that embeds a subwavelength periodic array of resonant high-density (hard) inclusions to create an effective medium with a uniform negative density shift. Specifically, we place a periodic cluster of inclusions of size $a$ and density $\rho_1\asymp a^{-2}$ strictly inside $\Omega$. For frequencies $\omega$ tuned to an eigenvalue of the elastic Newton (Kelvin) operator of a single inclusion, we show that as $a\to0$ and the number of inclusions $M\to\infty$, the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map $\Lambda_D$ converges to an effective map $\Lambda_{\mathcal{P}}$ corresponding to a background density shift $-\mathcal{P}^2$, with the operator norm estimate $\|\Lambda_D-\Lambda_{\mathcal{P}}\|\le Ca^{\alpha}\mathcal{P}^6$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$ determined by the geometric scaling. Around this negative background we derive a first-order linearization of $\Lambda_{\mathcal{P}}$ in terms of $\rho$ and the Newton volume potential for the shifted Lam\'e operator. Testing the linearized relation with complex geometric optics solutions yields an explicit reconstruction formula for the Fourier transform of $\rho$, and hence a global density recovery scheme. The results provide a metamaterial-inspired analytic framework for inverse coefficient problems in linear elasticity and a concrete paradigm for leveraging nanoscale resonators in reconstruction algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive, by two$-$scale convergence, periodically wrinked shell models starting from three dimensional linear elasticity, depending of the behaviour of the small parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $p&gt;1$, differents theories appear. We assume that the mid-surface of the shell is given by $\displaystyle \psi(x_1,x_2)+\varepsilon^p\theta\left(\frac{x_1}{\varepsilon},\frac{x_2}{\varepsilon}\right)\vect{a}_{3}(x_1,x_2)$, where $\theta$ is $[0,1)^2$-periodic function and $p=2$. We also assume that the strain energy of the shell has the Koiter's model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish global $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity for bounded generalized solutions of elliptic equations in divergence form with Musielak-Orlicz growth and subject to Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. In fact, our findings extend and generalize several important regularity results in cases of special attention such as variable exponent spaces, Orlicz spaces, and some $(p,q)$ situations. We also point out new conditions in the analysis that focus on the interplay between non-standard growth conditions and the boundary behavior in such generalized examples.</description>

      <title>Qualitative reconstruction methods for imaging interior Robin interfaces in EIT from Robin-to-Dirichlet data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an inverse shape problem arising in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for nondestructive testing, in which interior defects are modeled through Robin transmission conditions. Unlike classical formulations, we impose Robin boundary conditions on both the exterior measurement surface and the interior interface, and use the Robin-to-Dirichlet (RtD) map as the available data. Within this setting, we develop qualitative (non-iterative) reconstruction methods based on the Linear Sampling Method (LSM) and the Regularized Factorization Method (RFM), and derive new analytical characterizations that enable these methods to identify interior regions. We further propose a numerical implementation that incorporates regularization strategies and demonstrate, through experiments, that the methods reliably reconstruct interior regions of interest.</description>

      <title>An efficient solver based on low-rank approximation and Neumann matrix series for unsteady diffusion-type partial differential equations with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an efficient numerical solver for unsteady diffusion-type partial differential equations with random coefficients. A major computational challenge in such problems lies in repeatedly handling large-scale linear systems arising from spatial and temporal discretizations under uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose a novel generalized low-rank matrix approximation to represent the stochastic stiffness matrices, and approximate their inverses using the Neumann matrix series expansion. This approach transforms high-dimensional matrix inversion into a sequence of low-dimensional matrix multiplications. Therefore, the solver significantly reduces the computational cost and storage requirements while maintaining high numerical accuracy. The error analysis of the proposed solver is also provided. Finally, we apply the method to two classic uncertainty quantification problems: unsteady stochastic diffusion equations and the associated distributed optimal control problems. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solver.</description>

      <title>Low-Regularity Solutions of the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation on the Spatial Quarter-Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hadamard well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with power nonlinearity formulated on the spatial quarter-plane is established in a low-regularity setting with Sobolev initial data and Dirichlet boundary data in appropriate Bourgain-type spaces. As both of the spatial variables are restricted to the half-line, a different approach is needed than the one previously used for the well-posedness of other initial-boundary value problems. In particular, now the solution of the forced linear initial-boundary problem is estimated \textit{directly}, both in Sobolev spaces and in Strichartz-type spaces, i.e. without a linear decomposition that would require estimates for the associated homogeneous and nonhomogeneous initial value problems. In the process of deriving the linear estimates, the function spaces for the boundary data are identified as the intersections of certain modified Bourgain-type spaces that involve spatial half-line Fourier transforms instead of the usual whole-line Fourier transform found in the definition of the standard Bourgain space associated with the one-dimensional initial value problem. The fact that the quarter-plane has a corner at the origin poses an additional challenge, as it requires one to expand the validity of certain Sobolev extension results to the case of a domain with a non-smooth (Lipschitz) and non-compact boundary.</description>

Abstract: We show interior Schauder estimates for a special class of fully nonlinear parabolic Isaacs equations by the maximum principle, providing an Evans-Krylov result for the model equation $\min\{\inf_{\beta}L_\beta u,\sup_\gamma L_\gamma u\}-\partial_t u=0$, where $L_\beta,L_\gamma$ are linear operators with possibly variable H\"older coefficients. We also give a proof of the Evans-Krylov theorem for fully nonlinear uniformly parabolic equations for which a regularity theory of the stationary non-homogeneous equation is available.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the higher-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a finite interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the local Hadamard well-posedness of a certain third-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a multi-term linear part and a general power nonlinearity known as the higher-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, formulated on a finite interval with a combination of nonzero Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Specifically, for initial and boundary data in suitable Sobolev spaces that are related to one another through the time regularity induced by the equation, we prove the existence of a unique solution as well as the continuous dependence of that solution on the data. The precise choice of solution space depends on the value of the Sobolev exponent and is dictated both by the linear estimates associated with the forced linear counterpart of the nonlinear initial-boundary value problem and, in the low-regularity setting below the Sobolev algebra property threshold, by certain nonlinear estimates that control the Sobolev norm of the power nonlinearity. In particular, as usual in Schr\"odinger-type equations, in the case of low regularity it is necessary to derive Strichartz estimates in suitable Lebesgue/Bessel potential spaces. The proof of well-posedness is based on a contraction mapping argument combined with the linear estimates, which are established by employing the explicit solution formula for the forced linear problem derived via the unified transform of Fokas. Due to the nature of the finite interval problem, this formula involves contour integrals in the complex Fourier plane with corresponding integrands that contain differences of exponentials in their denominators, thus requiring delicate handling through appropriate contour deformations. It is worth noting that, in addition to the various linear and nonlinear results obtained for the finite interval problem, novel time regularity results are established here also for the relevant half-line problem.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a first-order-in-time model for nonlinear acoustics with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study well-posedness of a first-order-in-time model for nonlinear acoustics with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions in fractional Sobolev spaces. The analysis proceeds by first establishing well-posedness of an abstract parabolic-type semilinear evolution equation. These results are then applied to concrete operators and function spaces that capture the boundary conditions relevant for realistic modeling.
  Our approach is based on the spectral decomposition of a positive definite self-adjoint operator, with solution regularity characterized via the domains of its fractional powers. Employing Galerkin's method and the Newton-Kantorovich theorem, we prove well-posedness for the abstract nonlinear system with possibly nonhomogeneous boundary data.
  The connection between (spectral) fractional powers of the Laplacian and fractional Sobolev spaces due to interpolation theory allows us to transfer these results to the nonlinear acoustic model under nonhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, yielding fractional Sobolev regularity. For Hodge/Lions boundary conditions, we establish well-posedness with solutions in classical Sobolev spaces of integer order.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Propagation of Chaos for 2D Viscous Vortex Model with General Circulations on the Whole Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive quantitative propagation of chaos in the sense of relative entropy for the 2D viscous vortex model with general circulations, approximating the vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation on the whole Euclidean space. Our results work on the general setting that the vortices are positioned on the whole space $\R^2$ and that the circulations are allowed to be in different magnitudes and orientations, which can be adapted to general unconfined realistic fluids with vorticity that may change sign. We provide explicit convergence rates which are optimal in $N$ and optimal in $t$ among existing literature. The key technical tools, which are our major novelty, are the sharp logarithmic growth estimates and a new ODE hierarchy and iterated integral estimates.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study removable singularities for regular $(1,\frac{1}{2s})$-Lipschitz solutions of the $s$-fractional heat equation for $1/2&lt;s&lt;1$. To do so, we define a Lipschitz fractional caloric capacity and study its critical dimension and the $L^2$-boundedness of a pair of singular integral operators, whose kernels will be the gradient of the fundamental solution of the fractional heat equation and its conjugate.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove a theorem of C.~Miranda on the H\"older regularity of convolution operators acting on the boundary of an open set in the limiting case in which the open set is of class $C^{1,1}$ and the densities are of class $C^{0,1}$. The convolution operators that we consider are generalizations of those that are associated to layer potential operators, which are a useful tool for the analysis of boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>Recovering a (1+1)-dimensional wave equation from a single white noise boundary measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following inverse problem: Suppose a $(1+1)$-dimensional wave equation on $\mathbb{R}_+$ with zero initial conditions is excited with a Neumann boundary data modelled as a white noise process. Given also the Dirichlet data at the same point, determine the unknown first order coefficient function of the system.
  We first establish that direct problem is well-posed. The inverse problem is then solved by showing that correlations of the boundary data determine the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator in the sense of distributions, which is known to uniquely identify the coefficient. This approach has applications in acoustic measurements of internal cross-sections of fluid pipes such as pressurised water supply pipes and vocal tract shape determination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the long-time dynamics of the radial solutions to the energy-critical wave equation in 3-dimensional space. Given a solution defined for all time $t\geq 0$, we show that the soliton resolution phenomenon happens at all times $t&gt;0$ except for a few relatively short time intervals. The main tool is the radiation theory of wave equations and the major observation of this work is a correspondence between the energy radiation and the soliton resolution/collision behaviour of solutions. We also give a few applications of the main observation on the type II blow-up solutions and ``one pass'' theory near pure mutli-solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantitative small noise limit in the $L^\infty$ norm of certain time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations equipped with Neumann boundary conditions, depending on the regularity of the data and the geometric properties of the domain. We first provide a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ rate of convergence for Hamilton-Jacobi equations with locally Lipschitz Hamiltonians posed on convex domains of the Euclidean space. We then enhance this speed of convergence in the case of quadratic Hamiltonians proving one-side rates of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\beta)$, $\beta\in(1/2,1)$. The results exploit recent $L^1$ contraction estimates for Fokker-Planck equations with bounded velocity fields on unbounded domains used to derive differential Harnack estimates for the corresponding Neumann heat flow.</description>

      <title>Proving symmetry of localized solutions and application to dihedral patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the framework developed in \cite{unbounded_domain_cadiot} to allow for rigorous proofs of existence of smooth, localized solutions in semi-linear partial differential equations possessing both space and non-space group symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on the Swift-Hohenberg model. In particular, for a given symmetry group $\mathcal{G}$, we construct a natural Hilbert space $H^l_{\mathcal{G}}$ containing only functions with $\mathcal{G}$-symmetry. In this space, products and differential operators are well-defined allowing for the study of autonomous semi-linear PDEs. Depending on the properties of $\mathcal{G}$, we derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach based on the construction of an approximate inverse around an approximate solution, $u_0$. More specifically, combining a meticulous analysis and computer-assisted techniques, the Newton-Kantorovich approach is validated thanks to the computation of some explicit bounds. The strategy for constructing $u_0$, the approximate inverse, and the computation of these bounds will depend on the properties of $\mathcal{G}$ and its maximal square lattice space subgroup, $\mathcal{H}$. More specifically, we consider three cases: $\mathcal{G}$ is a space group which can be represented on the square lattice, $\mathcal{G}$ is not a space group which can be represented on the square lattice and the symmetry of $\mathcal{H}$ isolates the solution, and where $\mathcal{G}$ is not a space group which can be represented on the square lattice and the symmetry of $\mathcal{H}$ does not isolate the solution. We demonstrate the methodology on the 2D Swift-Hohenberg PDE by proving the existence of various dihedral localized patterns. The algorithmic details to perform the computer-assisted proofs can be found on Github.</description>

      <title>A Class of De Giorgi Type and H\"older Continuity for Some Problems in Musielak-Orlicz-Sobolev Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of De Giorgi type functions, denoted by \(\mathcal{B}_{G(x,t)}\), and establish the H\"older continuity of its elements under suitable additional assumptions on the generalized \textnormal{N}-function \(G(x,t)\). As an application, we prove the H\"older continuity of solutions to quasilinear equations whose principal part is in divergence form with \(G(x,t)\)-growth conditions, including both critical and standard growth cases. The novelty of our work lies in the generalization of the H\"older continuity results previously known for variable exponent \cite[X, Fan and D. Zhao]{Fan1999} and Orlicz \cite[G. M. Lieberman]{Li1991} problems. Moreover, our results encompass a wide variety of quasilinear equations.</description>

      <title>Proving the existence of localized patterns and saddle node bifurcations in 1D activator-inhibitor type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework for constructively proving the existence and stability of stationary localized 1D solutions and saddle-node bifurcations in activator--inhibitor systems using computer-assisted proofs. Specifically, we develop the necessary analysis to compute explicit upper bounds required in a Newton--Kantorovich approach. Given an approximate solution $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$, this approach relies on establishing that a well-chosen fixed point map is contracting on a neighborhood $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$. For this matter, we construct an approximate inverse of the linearization around $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$, and establish sufficient conditions under which the contraction is achieved. This provides a framework for which computer-assisted analysis can be applied to verify the existence and local uniqueness of solutions in a vicinity of $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$, and control the linearization around $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$. Furthermore, we extend the method to rigorously establish saddle-node bifurcations of localized solutions for the same type of models, by considering a well--chosen zero--finding problem. This depends on the rigorous control of the spectrum of the linearization around the bifurcation point. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework by proving the existence and stability of multiple steady-state patterns in various activator--inhibitor systems, as well as a saddle--node bifurcation in the Glycolysis model.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of weak solution concepts for mean curvature flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a connection between weak solution concepts of mean curvature flow. On the one side we have the viscosity solution which is based on the comparison principle. On the other, variational solutions, which are combined Brakke flows and distributional solutions. We prove that if one has a foliation by variational solutions, then the resulting function is the unique viscosity solution.
  This answers an open question suggested by the work of Evans and Spruck [J. Geom. Anal., 5(1), 1995] and the authors [J. Geom. Anal., 34(12), 2024]. These results show that almost every level set of the viscosity solution is a variational solution. Thus, we establish the equivalence of these solution concepts. Moreover, we show the generic uniqueness of variational solutions.</description>

Abstract: We study interior $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity estimates for solutions of fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations of the general form $F(D^2u)=0$ in two independent variables and without any geometric condition on $F$. By means of the theory of divergence form equations we prove that $C^2$ solutions of the previous equation are $C^{2,\bar\alpha(\lambda/\Lambda)}$ in the interior of the domain, where $0&lt;\lambda\leq\Lambda$ are the ellipticity constants. We finally exploit the theory of nondivergence equations in the plane to obtain $C^{2,\tilde\alpha}$ regularity for an explicit exponent $\tilde\alpha=\tilde\alpha(\lambda/\Lambda)&gt;\lambda/\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Phase-Textured Complex Viscosity in Linear Viscous Flows: Non-Normality Without Advection, Corner Defects, and 3D Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic incompressible flow with a spatially resolved complex viscosity field $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$ and, at fixed forcing frequency $\omega&gt;0$, its constitutive phase texture $\varphi(\mathbf{x})=\arg\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$. In three-dimensional domains periodic in a spanwise direction $z$, $z$-dependence of $\mu^*$ converts coefficient multiplication into convolution in spanwise Fourier index, yielding an operator-valued Toeplitz/Laurent coupling of modes. Consequently, even spanwise-uniform forcing generically produces $\kappa\neq 0$ sidebands in the harmonic response as a \emph{linear, constitutive} effect.
  We place $\mu^*$ at the closure level $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}=2\,\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\mathbf{D}(\hat{\mathbf{v}})$, as the boundary value of the Laplace transform of a causal stress-memory kernel. Under the passivity condition $\Re\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\ge \mu_{\min}&gt;0$, the oscillatory Stokes/Oseen operators are realized as m-sectorial operators associated with coercive sectorial forms on bounded Lipschitz (including cornered) domains, yielding existence, uniqueness, and frequency-dependent stability bounds.
  Spatial variation of $\varphi$ renders the viscous operator intrinsically non-normal even in the absence of advection, so amplification is governed by resolvent geometry (and associated pseudospectra), not by eigenvalues alone. In the pure-phase class $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)=\mu_0(\omega)e^{i\varphi(\mathbf{x})}$, the texture strength is quantified by $\mu_0(\omega)\|\nabla\varphi\|_{L^\infty}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a homogenization problem related to a non-local interface energy with a periodic forcing term. We show the existence of planelike minimizers for such energy. Moreover, we prove that, under suitable assumptions on the non-local kernel and the external field, the sequence of rescaled energies $\Gamma$-converges to a suitable local anisotropic perimeter, where the anisotropy is defined as the limit of the normalized energy of a planelike minimizer in larger and larger cubes (i.e., what is called in jargon "stable norm"). To obtain this, we also establish several auxiliary results, including: the minimality of the level sets of the minimizers, explicit bounds on the oscillations of the minimizers, density estimates for almost minimizers, and non-local perimeter estimates in the large.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limit of Non-exchangeable interacting diffusions with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean-field limit of interacting diffusions without exchangeability, caused by weighted interactions and non-i.i.d. initial values, are investigated. The weights could be signed and unbounded. The result applies to a large class of singular kernels including the Biot-Savart law. We demonstrate a flexible type of mean-field convergence, in contrast to the typical convergence of $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\delta_{X_i}$. More specifically, the sequence of signed empirical measure processes with arbitrary uniform $l^r$-weights, $r&gt;1$, weakly converges to a coupled PDE's, such as the dynamics describing the passive scalar advected by the 2D Navier-Stokes equation. 
  Our method is based on a tightness/compactness argument and makes use of the systems' uniform Fisher information. The main difficulty is to determine how to propagate the regularity properties of the limits of empirical measures in the absence of the DeFinetti-Hewitt-Savage theorem for the non-exchangeable case. To this end, a sequence of random measures, which merges weakly with a sequence of weighted empirical measures and has uniform Sobolev regularity, is constructed through the disintegration of the joint laws of particles.</description>

      <title>Faithful global convergence for the rescaled Consensus-Based Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) algorithm with a consensus point rescaled by a small fixed parameter $\kappa \in (0,1)$. Under minimal assumptions on the objective function and the initial data, we establish its unconditional convergence to the global minimizer. Our results hold in the asymptotic regime where both the time--horizon $t \to \infty$ and the inverse--temperature $\alpha \to \infty$, providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for the algorithm's global convergence. Furthermore, our findings extend to the case of multiple and non--discrete set of minimizers.</description>

      <title>Backwards uniqueness for Mean curvature flow with asymptotically conical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that if two mean curvature flows of compact hypersurfaces $M^1_t$ and $M^2_t$ encounter only isolated, multiplicity one, asymptotically conical singularities at the first singular time $T$, and if $M^1_T=M^2_T$ then $M^1_t=M^2_t$ for every $t\in [0,T]$. This is seemingly the first backwards uniqueness result for any geometric flow with singularities, that assumes neither self-shrinking nor global asymptotically conical behaviour. This necessitates the development of new global tools to deal with both the core of the singularity, its asymptotic structure, and the smooth part of the flows simultaneously. As an immediate application, we show that low entropy flows in $\mathbb{R}^4$ are backwards unique</description>

      <title>An operatorial approach of the well-posedness of an algebraic Riccati equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the state feedback control in an $% H^{\infty }$-optimal control problem involves a challenging approach of the associated algebraic Riccati equation of the generic form $A^{\ast }P+PA+P\Gamma P=F$. In view of this objective, we explore in this paper the existence of the solution to this algebraic Riccati equation by a direct operatorial approach in the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. The proofs are provided, under certain assumptions on the operators $\Gamma $ and $F,$ for the cases with $A$ coercive and $A\geq 0,$ respectively. They develop a constructive approach, possibly indicating a method for finding the numerical solution. Next, relying on the existence of the solution to the Riccati equation, we provide then a result concerning the associated $% H^{\infty }$-optimal control problem. An example regarding the application of the existence proof for the solution to the Riccati equation is given for a parabolic equation with a singular potential of Hardy type.</description>
