      <title>Reflecting to learn in a physics multimedia communication course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Science communication skills are considered essential learning objectives for undergraduate physics students. However, high enrollment and limited class resources present significant barriers to providing students ample opportunities to practice their formal presentation skills. We investigate the use of integrated critical reflection and peer evaluation activities in a physics senior seminar course both to improve student learning outcomes and to supplement highly restricted presentation time. Throughout the semester, each student delivers one 8-min multimedia presentation on either their research or an upper-division course topic. Following each presentation, audience members complete one of two randomly assigned peer evaluations: a treatment form that prompts critical reflection or a control form that does not. Each class period concludes with a short quiz on concepts presented in that day's presentations. We observe minimal differences in quiz scores between students in the control and treatment groups. Instead, we find that retention and transfer of presentation content correlate with certain metrics of presentation quality described in the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning and with self-identified prior exposure to presentation topics.</description>

      <title>The Law of Closest Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Law of Closest Approach which is derived from the properties of conic orbits and can be considered an addendum to the laws of Kepler. It states that on the closest approach, the distance between the objects is minimal and the velocity vector is perpendicular to the position vector with maximum speed. The ratio of twice the kinetic energy to the negative potential energy is equal to the eccentricity plus one. The advantage of this law is that both speed and position are at extremum making the calculation of the eccentricity more robust.</description>
