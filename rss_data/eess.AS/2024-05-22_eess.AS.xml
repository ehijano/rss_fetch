      <title>A Survey of Integrating Wireless Technology into Active Noise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Noise Control (ANC) is a widely adopted technology for reducing environmental noise across various scenarios. This paper focuses on enhancing noise reduction performance, particularly through the refinement of signal quality fed into ANC systems. We discuss the main wireless technique integrated into the ANC system, equipped with some innovative algorithms, in diverse environments. Instead of using microphone arrays, which increase the computation complexity of the ANC system, to isolate multiple noise sources to improve noise reduction performance, the application of the wireless technique avoids extra computation demand. Wireless transmissions of reference, error, and control signals are also applied to improve the convergence performance of the ANC system. Furthermore, this paper lists some wireless ANC applications, such as earbuds, headphones, windows, and headrests, underscoring their adaptability and efficiency in various settings.</description>

      <title>Mamba in Speech: Towards an Alternative to Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer and its derivatives have achieved success in diverse tasks across computer vision, natural language processing, and speech processing. To reduce the complexity of computations within the multi-head self-attention mechanism in Transformer, Selective State Space Models (i.e., Mamba) were proposed as an alternative. Mamba exhibited its effectiveness in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, but its superiority has rarely been investigated in speech signal processing. This paper explores solutions for applying Mamba to speech processing using two typical speech processing tasks: speech recognition, which requires semantic and sequential information, and speech enhancement, which focuses primarily on sequential patterns. The results exhibit the superiority of bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) for speech processing to vanilla Mamba. Moreover, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BiMamba as an alternative to the self-attention module in Transformer and its derivates, particularly for the semantic-aware task. The crucial technologies for transferring Mamba to speech are then summarized in ablation studies and the discussion section to offer insights for future research.</description>

      <title>SYMPLEX: Controllable Symbolic Music Generation using Simplex Diffusion with Vocabulary Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach for fast and controllable generation of symbolic music based on the simplex diffusion, which is essentially a diffusion process operating on probabilities rather than the signal space. This objective has been applied in domains such as natural language processing but here we apply it to generating 4-bar multi-instrument music loops using an orderless representation. We show that our model can be steered with vocabulary priors, which affords a considerable level control over the music generation process, for instance, infilling in time and pitch and choice of instrumentation -- all without task-specific model adaptation or applying extrinsic control.</description>

      <title>Blind Separation of Vibration Sources using Deep Learning and Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrations of rotating machinery primarily originate from two sources, both of which are distorted by the machine's transfer function on their way to the sensor: the dominant gear-related vibrations and a low-energy signal linked to bearing faults. The proposed method facilitates the blind separation of vibration sources, eliminating the need for any information about the monitored equipment or external measurements. This method estimates both sources in two stages: initially, the gear signal is isolated using a dilated CNN, followed by the estimation of the bearing fault signal using the squared log envelope of the residual. The effect of the transfer function is removed from both sources using a novel whitening-based deconvolution method (WBD). Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the method's ability to detect bearing failures early when no additional information is available. This study considers both local and distributed bearing faults, assuming that the vibrations are recorded under stable operating conditions.</description>

      <title>A Dataset and Baselines for Measuring and Predicting the Music Piece Memorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, humans are constantly exposed to music, whether through voluntary streaming services or incidental encounters during commercial breaks. Despite the abundance of music, certain pieces remain more memorable and often gain greater popularity. Inspired by this phenomenon, we focus on measuring and predicting music memorability. To achieve this, we collect a new music piece dataset with reliable memorability labels using a novel interactive experimental procedure. We then train baselines to predict and analyze music memorability, leveraging both interpretable features and audio mel-spectrograms as inputs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore music memorability using data-driven deep learning-based methods. Through a series of experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that while there is room for improvement, predicting music memorability with limited data is possible. Certain intrinsic elements, such as higher valence, arousal, and faster tempo, contribute to memorable music. As prediction techniques continue to evolve, real-life applications like music recommendation systems and music style transfer will undoubtedly benefit from this new area of research.</description>

      <title>On a time-frequency blurring operator with applications in data augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the success of recent data augmentation methods for signals which act on time-frequency representations, we introduce an operator which convolves the short-time Fourier transform of a signal with a specified kernel. Analytical properties including boundedness, compactness and positivity are investigated from the perspective of time-frequency analysis. A convolutional neural network and a vision transformer are trained to classify audio signals using spectrograms with different augmentation setups, including the above mentioned time-frequency blurring operator, with results indicating that the operator can significantly improve test performance, especially in the data-starved regime.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the analysis of murine neonatal ultrasonic vocalizations: Development, evaluation, and application of different mathematical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rodents employ a broad spectrum of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) for social communication. As these vocalizations offer valuable insights into affective states, social interactions, and developmental stages of animals, various deep learning approaches have aimed to automate both the quantitative (detection) and qualitative (classification) analysis of USVs. Here, we present the first systematic evaluation of different types of neural networks for USV classification. We assessed various feedforward networks, including a custom-built, fully-connected network and convolutional neural network, different residual neural networks (ResNets), an EfficientNet, and a Vision Transformer (ViT). Paired with a refined, entropy-based detection algorithm (achieving recall of 94.9% and precision of 99.3%), the best architecture (achieving 86.79% accuracy) was integrated into a fully automated pipeline capable of analyzing extensive USV datasets with high reliability. Additionally, users can specify an individual minimum accuracy threshold based on their research needs. In this semi-automated setup, the pipeline selectively classifies calls with high pseudo-probability, leaving the rest for manual inspection. Our study focuses exclusively on neonatal USVs. As part of an ongoing phenotyping study, our pipeline has proven to be a valuable tool for identifying key differences in USVs produced by mice with autism-like behaviors.</description>

      <title>EnCodecMAE: Leveraging neural codecs for universal audio representation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of universal audio representation learning is to obtain foundational models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks involving speech, music and environmental sounds. To approach this problem, methods inspired by works on self-supervised learning for NLP, like BERT, or computer vision, like masked autoencoders (MAE), are often adapted to the audio domain. In this work, we propose masking representations of the audio signal, and training a MAE to reconstruct the masked segments. The reconstruction is done by predicting the discrete units generated by EnCodec, a neural audio codec, from the unmasked inputs. We evaluate this approach, which we call EnCodecMAE, on a wide range of tasks involving speech, music and environmental sounds. Our best model outperforms various state-of-the-art audio representation models in terms of global performance. Additionally, we evaluate the resulting representations in the challenging task of automatic speech recognition (ASR), obtaining decent results and paving the way for a universal audio representation.</description>

      <title>A framework of text-dependent speaker verification for chinese numerical string corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chinese numerical string corpus, serves as a valuable resource for speaker verification, particularly in financial transactions. Researches indicate that in short speech scenarios, text-dependent speaker verification (TD-SV) consistently outperforms text-independent speaker verification (TI-SV). However, TD-SV potentially includes the validation of text information, that can be negatively impacted by reading rhythms and pauses. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end speaker verification system that enhances TD-SV by decoupling speaker and text information. Our system consists of a text embedding extractor, a speaker embedding extractor and a fusion module. In the text embedding extractor, we employ an enhanced Transformer and introduce a triple loss including text classification loss, connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss and decoder loss; while in the speaker embedding extractor, we create a multi-scale pooling method by combining sliding window attentive statistics pooling (SWASP) with attentive statistics pooling (ASP). To mitigate the scarcity of data, we have recorded a publicly available Chinese numerical corpus named SHALCAS22A (hereinafter called SHAL), which can be accessed on Open-SLR. Moreover, we employ data augmentation techniques using Tacotron2 and HiFi-GAN. Our method achieves an equal error rate (EER) performance improvement of 49.2% on Hi-Mia and 75.0% on SHAL, respectively.</description>
