      <title>Surface Binding Energies for Amorphous Plagioclase Feldspar Calculated using Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the well-established presence of amorphous compounds on planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mercury due to space weathering, the direct effect of atomic arrangement on the surface binding energies (SBEs) of elements on these bodies remains largely unexplored. Accurate SBE values are essential for reliably predicting sputtering yields and the energy distribution of ejecta. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify SBEs for the different elements sputtered from amorphous atomic arrangements of the plagioclase feldspar end members, albite and anorthite, and compare to their crystalline counterparts. Results show that while the mean elemental SBEs from amorphous surfaces are not significantly different from their crystalline counterparts, the random orientation in amorphous structures gives rise to a spectrum of bonding configurations, resulting in a distribution of SBEs with a wider range. This contrasts with the clearly discretized set of SBE values associated with the ordered atomic structure of crystalline surfaces. We then consider sputtering by H, He, and a solar wind combination of 96% H and 4% He. For each of these cases, we demonstrate that there is minimal difference (&lt;10% for albite and &lt;20% for anorthite) between the sputtering yields of amorphous and crystalline surfaces. We attribute these results to the presence of the same elemental bonds across different atomic arrangements, which leads to similar mean SBEs and, consequently, comparable sputtering yields.</description>

      <title>Stress in chromium thin films deposited by DC magnetron sputtering on grounded cupper and stainless-steel substrate holders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromium thin films deposited on silicon substrates by DC magnetron sputtering were systematically investigated as a function of film thickness, using a DC power of 50 W and a post-deposition annealing temperature of 200 C. Two types of grounded substrate holders, copper and stainless steel, were employed to assess substrate-dependent effects. The intrinsic stress, determined by the wafer curvature method, decreases with increasing film thickness but increases with the annealing temperature. It is observed that for thinner as-deposited chromium films, the stress showed a pronounced irreversible increase when measured immediately after deposition and after several days of aging. Films deposited on copper holders consistently exhibited higher stress values than those grown on stainless steel holders. These observations suggest that the intrinsic stress in as-deposited films is linked to the growth mechanism, while the stress increase after annealing may be related to thermally active diffusion and structural relaxation. The higher stress in films grown on copper substrate holder can likely be associated with enhanced ion bombardment due to the higher electrical conductivity of copper.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic anisotropy of amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ compounds deposited by magnetron sputtering change with film thickness from in plane to out of plane anisotropy at thickness above 40 nm. Xray reflectivity measurements shows the progressive formation of an additional layer in between the 3 nm thick Si capping layer and the NdCo compound film. Hard Xray Photoemission spectroscoy (HAXPES) was used to analyze the composition and distribution of cobalt and neodymium at the top layers region of NdCo$_{4.6}$ films of thickness ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm using 7 keV, 10 keV and 13 keV incident photon energies, with inelastic electron mean free paths ranging from 7.2 nm to 12.3 nm in cobalt. The atomic cobalt concentration of the alloy deduced from HAXPES measurements at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations results to be bellow the nominal value, changing with thickness and incident photon energy. This proves a segregation of the rare earth at the surface of the NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin film which increases with thickness. The analysis of the background of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks was consistent with this conclusion. This demonstrates that neodymium incorporation in the cobalt lattice have a cost in energy which can be associated to strain due to the difference in volume between the two elements. The lowering of this strain energy will favor atomic anisotropic environments for neodymium that explains the perpendicular anisotropy and its thickness dependence of these thin film compounds.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Spin-momentum locking in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-momentum locking in altermagnets has been deeply explored in the non-relativistic limit. Including spin-orbit coupling, altermagnets exhibit antisymmetric exchange interactions, leading to spin cantings. Therefore, the spin-momentum locking differs among the three spin components Sx, Sy, and Sz, forming the relativistic spin-momentum locking. We consider orthorhombic YVO3 and hexagonal MnTe. For YVO3, the relativistic locking comprises s-, dxy -, and dxz-wave. In MnTe, the dominant component Sy of MnTe inherits the polarized charge distribution and the non-relativistic spin-momentum locking bulk g-wave, but the breaking of the C6z rotational symmetry by the Neel vector lowers the symmetry from g-wave to d-wave. The relativistic spin-momentum locking for MnTe is composed of dxz-, dyz- and s-wave. Despite small magnitudes in real space, the canted spin components contribute significant spectral weight in k-space, impacting k-space properties such as the spin-Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Strong Intra- and Interchain Orbital Coupling Leads to Multiband and High Thermoelectric Performance in Na$_2$Au$X$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb, and Bi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic coupling among electrical conductivity ($\sigma$), Seebeck coefficient ($S$), and lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$) imposes a fundamental limit on the dimensionless figure of merit $ZT$ in thermoelectric (TE) materials. Increasing band degeneracy can effectively balance $\sigma$ and $S$, enabling a high power factor (PF, $S^{2}\sigma$). However, compounds with intrinsically large band degeneracy are scarce. Here, we present an unconventional strategy to realize elevated band degeneracy in zigzag-chain Na$_2$Au$X$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds by harnessing strong intra- and interchain orbital coupling. Pronounced hybridization between Au-$d_{z^{2}}$ and $X$-$p_{z}$ orbitals along the Au--$X$ zigzag chains, together with unexpectedly strong interchain $X$-$p_{x}/p_{y}$ coupling, produces a highly dispersive, multivalley valence band structure that supports an exceptional PF. Concurrently, the intrinsically weak interchain interactions arising from the quasi-one-dimensional framework, together with the weakened Au--$X$ and Au--Au bonds within the chains due to filling of $p$-$d^{*}$ antibonding states, result in an ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$. First-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory predict that $p$-type Na$_2$AuBi achieves a PF of $63.9\,\mu\mathrm{W}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\,\mathrm{K}^{-2}$, an ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ of $0.49\,\mathrm{W}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and a maximum $ZT$ of $4.7$ along the zigzag-chain direction at $800\,\mathrm{K}$. This work establishes a new design paradigm for high-efficiency TE materials by exploiting substantial orbital overlap in structurally weakly bonded, quasi-one-dimensional systems, opening promising avenues for the discovery and engineering of next-generation high-performance TE materials.</description>

      <title>Variational Calculations of the Excited States of the Charged NV-center in Diamond Using a Hybrid Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excited electronic states involved in the optical cycle preparation of a pure spin state of the negatively charged NV-defect in diamond are calculated using the HSE06 hybrid density functional and variational optimization of the orbitals. This includes the energy of the excited triplet as well as the two lowest singlet states with respect to the ground triplet state. In addition to the vertical excitation, the effect of structural relaxation is also estimated using analytical atomic forces. The lowering of the energy in the triplet excited state and the resulting zero-phonon line triplet excitation energy are both within 0.1 eV of the experimental estimates. An analogous relaxation in the lower energy singlet state using spin purified atomic forces is estimated to be 0.06 eV. These results, obtained with a hybrid density functional, improve on previously published results using local and semi-local functionals, which are known to underestimate the band gap. The good agreement with experimental estimates demonstrates how time-independent variational calculations of excited states using density functionals can give accurate results and, thereby, provide a powerful screening tool for identifying other defect systems as candidates for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Cu diffusion and bonding anisotropy on the thermoelectric performance of double cation chalcohalides $CuBiSeX_{2} (X = Cl, Br)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double cation chalcohalide have recently been emerged as the interesting candidates for sustainable energy conversion applications, owing to their intrinsic chemical tunability, suitable band gap, and low thermal conductivity. With this motivation, the current study is designed to explore the structural, electron and phonon transport mechanism, and thermoelectric properties of $CuBiSeX_{2} (X = Cl, Br)$ through density functional theory-based computations. The experimental feasibility of the compounds is ensured, and they are predicted to be thermally, dynamically, and mechanically stable. The distinct structural attributes coupled with suitable electronic band structure promotes the electron transport properties. Comprehensively, the delocalized Cu atom enhancing the phonon scattering process and the off-centred displacement of cations leading to bonding anharmonicity results ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity $(\kappa_L)$. Among these systems, $CuBiSeCl_2$ exhibits low $\kappa_L$ (0.24 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K) and superior thermoelectric performance (zT = 1.18 at 600 K), whereas $CuBiSeBr_2$ ($\kappa_L$ = 0.65 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, zT = 0.68 at 600 K) demands further optimization. Overall, the study sheds light into the interplay between the Cu diffusion and bonding anisotropy in phonon propagation and establishes the potential of double-cation chalcohalides for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of extreme ultraviolet sources is critical for advancing angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), a powerful technique for probing the electronic structure of materials. Here, we report the construction of a tabletop 10.8-eV femtosecond laser through cascaded third-harmonic generation, which operates at a repetition rate of 1 MHz and delivers a photon flux of approximately 1012 photons/s. The system achieves a high energy resolution of approximately 11.8 meV and tunable polarization. This flexibility enables detailed studies of orbitaland (pseudo)spin characteristics in quantum materials. We demonstrate the capabilities of this laser-ARPES system by investigating several prototypical materials, showcasing its potential for elucidating complex phenomena in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Edge Magnetism in Colloidal MoS2 Triangular Nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of localized magnetic domains at the nanoscale holds great promise for next-generation spintronic applications. Colloidal transition metal dichalcogenides nanostructures are experimentally accessible and chemically tunable platforms for spintronics, deserving dedicated research to assess their potential. Here, we investigate from first principles free-standing triangular MoS2 nanoflakes with sulfur-terminated, hydrogen-passivated edges, to probe intrinsic spin behavior at varying side lengths. We find a critical edge length of approximately 1.5 nm separating nonmagnetic nanoflakes from larger ones with a magnetic ground state emerging from several, energetically competing spin configurations. In these systems, the magnetic activity is not uniformly distributed along the edges but localized on specific "magnetic islands" around molybdenum edge atoms. The localization of magnetic moments is robust even in non-equilateral nanoflake geometries, highlighting their intrinsic stability regardless of the (high) symmetry of the hosting structure. These findings establish that the S-terminated, H-passivated triangular MoS2 nanoflakes are a stable and experimentally accessible platform via colloidal synthesis for low-dimensional, next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Dynamic Luminescent Mapping of pH with Sustainable Lignin-Derived Carbon Dots with Multimodal Readout Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the use of CQDs synthesized from lignin - currently one of the most abundant and underutilized by-products of paper and pulp production - for advanced pH monitoring applications. The presented approach integrates green chemistry principles with an operator-friendly, low-cost, and practical solution for spatial and temporal pH measurement. CQDs functionalized with m-aminophenylboronic acid enable highly sensitive and reversible pH readouts through two complementary mechanisms: ratiometric monitoring of emission band intensities, and direct visual observation of colorimetric changes reflected in the CIE1931 chromaticity coordinates. The system achieves maximal sensitivities of 137 percent per pH unit and 49.5 percent per pH unit, respectively, while simultaneously maintaining high measurement resolution and full reproducibility of the readouts, placing it among the most effective CQD-based pH sensors reported to date. Here, we demonstrate the capability of 2D luminescent imaging of pH distributions, allowing for both spatially resolved and time-resolved monitoring. Employing just an excitation source, a digital camera or smartphone, and RGB channel analysis, the setup eliminates the necessity for specialized filters or sophisticated instrumentation. The combination of multimodal readout strategies with the capacity for large-area visualization establishes lignin-derived CQDs as a sustainable and practical platform for pH sensing. By simultaneously addressing the challenges of waste valorization and the demand for innovative sensing technologies, this solution fulfills the requirements of both environmentally responsible material design and next-generation pH sensor development.</description>

      <title>Observation of Hexagonal Close-Packed Water Ice at Extreme Pressures and Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the phase diagram of water ice under extreme conditions remains a fundamental challenge in high-pressure physics. While theoretical predictions have long suggested the existence of compact phases, such as face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures, yet only the fcc phase has been experimentally confirmed. Here, we report the first direct observation of a hcp ice phase using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Between 80 and 200 GPa, we observe the coexistence of fcc and hcp ice, arising from stacking disorder in the fcc oxygen layers, similar to phenomena seen in compressed noble gases. Above 200 GPa, the hcp phase becomes dominant and is recovered at 300 K, indicating its increased thermodynamic stability at ultrahigh pressures. These findings not only expand our understanding of water's complex behavior under extreme conditions but also may play a crucial role in the interiors of giant icy planets.</description>

      <title>Energy evolution in nanocrystalline iron driven by collision cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanocrystalline materials are promising candidates for future fusion reactor applications, due to their high density of grain boundaries which may serve as sinks for irradiation induced defects. We use molecular dynamics to simulate collision cascades in nanocrystalline iron and compare these to collision cascades in initially defect free single crystals. We create nanocrystalline samples via Voronoi tessellation of initially randomly placed grain seeds and via severe plastic shearing. An irradiation induced annealing is observed whereby after ~ 2 displacements per atom (dpa), irradiation drives all simulation cells to a single crystalline state. Irradiation-induced defects that distort the lattice generate elastic strain, so we use excess potential energy as a measure of defect content. At low doses, the Voronoi samples feature a few large, low energy grains, whereas the sheared samples show many small, high energy grains due to the high defect and grain boundary content caused by severe deformation. As dose increases beyond 1 dpa however, all nanocrystalline samples converge to a similar behaviour. Excess potential energy mirrors this trend, plateauing above ~ 4 dpa. We hypothesise that the initially pristine cells will also reach a similar plateau after 5 dpa, which is seemingly confirmed by running a single instance of each cell type to 10 dpa. A model is developed to explain the energy evolution.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Study of Irradiation-Induced Defect and Dislocation Evolution in Strained Nickel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the influence of mechanical strain on irradiation-induced defect and dislocation evolution in nickel single crystals subjected to cumulative overlapping 5 keV collision cascades at 300 K. The simulations reveal that tensile strain modifies the dynamics of defect generation and recovery, promoting stress-assisted defect mobility and enhancing defect survival compared to the unstrained case. The heat spike duration and intensity decrease systematically with increasing strain, indicating faster energy dissipation and altered defect recombination behavior under applied stress. Analysis of the dislocation structure shows that Shockley-type partial dislocations dominate the microstructural response, while Hirth and other dislocation types remain comparatively minor. Both the total and Shockley dislocation densities reach a saturation value of $~10^{16}m^{-2}$ , marking the establishment of a steady-state microstructure governed by the balance between dislocation accumulation and recovery. The evolution of the total dislocation density with strain is successfully described by the Kocks-Mecking model, demonstrating its applicability to strain-dependent irradiation effects in metallic systems</description>

      <title>Anomalous enhancement of magnetism by nonmagnetic doping in the honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnet ErOCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning magnetic anisotropy through chemical doping is a powerful strategy for designing functional materials with enhanced magnetic properties. Here, we report an enhanced Er^3+ magnetic moment resulting from nonmagnetic Lu^3+ substitution in the honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnet ErOCl. Unlike the Curie-Weiss type divergence typically observed in diluted magnetic systems, our findings reveal a distinct enhancement of magnetization per Er^3+ ion under high magnetic fields, suggesting an unconventional mechanism. Structural analysis reveals that Lu^3+ doping leads to a pronounced contraction of the c axis, which is attributed to chemical pressure effects, while preserving the layered SmSI-type crystal structure with space group R-3m. High-resolution Raman spectroscopy reveals a systematic blueshift of the first and seventh crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations, indicating an increase in the axial CEF parameter B_2^0. This modification enhances the magnetic anisotropy along the c axis, leading to a significant increase in magnetization at low temperatures and under high magnetic fields, contrary to conventional expectations for magnetic dilution. Our work not only clarifies the intimate connection between magnetism and CEF in rare-earth compounds, but more importantly, it reveals a physical pathway to effectively tune magnetic anisotropy via anisotropic lattice distortion induced by chemical pressure.</description>

      <title>Noise Estimation and Suppression in Quantitative EMCD Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enables the measurement of magnetic moments with elemental and atomic site sensitivity, but its practical application is fundamentally limited by noise. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in EMCD measurements, demonstrated on Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae. By employing a classical three-beam geometry and long-term acquisition of electron energy-loss spectra, we systematically analyze the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across individual energy channels using bootstrap statistics. A robust energy alignment procedure based on the neighboring Ba-M4,5 edges with an adequate energy upsampling is introduced to minimize systematic errors from energy misalignment. The impact of detector noise, particularly from CMOS-based EELS cameras, is evaluated through variance-to-mean analysis and described by the noise amplification coefficients, revealing that detector-amplified shot noise is the dominant noise source. We recommend a stricter SNR threshold for reliable EMCD detection and quantification, ensuring that critical spectral features such as the Fe-L2,3 peaks meet the requirements for quantitative analysis. The approach also provides a framework for determining the minimum electron dose necessary for valid measurements and can be generalized to scintillator-based or direct electron detectors. This work advances the reliability of EMCD as a quantitative tool for magnetic characterization at the nanoscale with unknown magnetic structures. The proposed procedures lay the groundwork for improved error handling and SNR optimization in future EMCD studies.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of van Hove Singularity and Coupled Itinerant Ferromagnetism in Quasi-2D Oxide Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering van Hove singularities (vHss) near the Fermi level, if feasible, offers a powerful route to control exotic quantum phases in electronic and magnetic behaviors. However, conventional approaches, which rely primarily on chemical and electrical doping, focus mainly on local electrical or optical measurements, limiting their applicability to coupled functionalities. In this study, a vHs-induced insulator-metal transition coupled with a ferromagnetic phase transition was empirically achieved in atomically designed quasi-2D SrRuO3 (SRO) superlattices via epitaxial strain engineering, which has not been observed in conventional 3D SRO systems. Theoretical calculations revealed that epitaxial strain effectively modulates the strength and energy positions of vHs of specific Ru orbitals, driving correlated phase transitions in the electronic and magnetic ground states. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the anisotropic electronic structure of quasi-2D SRO modulated by epitaxial strain. Magneto-optic Kerr effect and electrical transport measurements demonstrated modulated magnetic and electronic phases. Furthermore, magneto-electrical measurements detected significant anomalous Hall effect signals and ferromagnetic magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of magnetically coupled charge carriers in the 2D metallic regime. This study establishes strain engineering as a promising platform for tuning vHss and resultant itinerant ferromagnetism of low-dimensional correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine-Learning Pipeline for Data-Driven Defect Detection and Characterisation: Application to Displacement Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron irradiation produces, within a few picoseconds, displacement cascades that are sequences of atomic collisions generating point and extended defects which subsequently affects the long-term evolution of materials. The diversity of these defects, characterized morphologically and statistically, defines what is called the "primary damage". In this work, we present a fully unsupervised machine learning (ML) workflow that detects and classifies these defects directly from molecular dynamics data. Local environments are encoded by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) vector, anomalous atoms are isolated with autoencoder neural networks (AE), embedded with Uniform Man- ifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). Applied to 80 keV displacement cascades in Ni, Fe70Ni10Cr20, and Zr, the AE successfully identify the small fraction of outlier atoms that participate in defect formation. HDBSCAN then partitions the UMAP latent space of AE-flagged SOAP de- scriptors into well defined groups representing vacancy- and interstitial-dominated regions and, within each, separates small from large aggregates, assigning 99.7 % of outliers to compact physical motifs. A signed cluster-identification score confirms this separation, and cluster size scales with net defect counts (R2 &gt; 0.89). Statistical cross analyses between the ML outlier map and several conventional detectors (centrosymmetry, dislocation extraction, etc.) reveal strong overlap and complementary coverage, all achieved without template or threshold tuning. This ML workflow thus provides an efficient tool for the quantitative mapping of structural anomalies in materials, particularly those arising from irradiation damage in displacement cascades.</description>

      <title>Evolution of electronic and magnetic properties in Mn- and Co-alloyed ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals are an intriguing class of quantum materials as the presence of both flat bands and Dirac points provides access to functional properties present in strongly correlated and topological materials. To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.</description>

      <title>Tunable magnetism in 2D organic-ion-intercalated MnPS3 via molecule-dependent vacancy generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of van der Waals materials are profoundly influenced by structural defects. The layered antiferromagnet MnPS3 offers a unique opportunity to explore defect-related magnetism, as Mn2+ vacancies can be generated by the intercalation of specific guest molecules. However, the effectiveness of this process in atomically thin flakes and the extent of the magnetic tunability remain unclear. Here, we show that the magnetic properties of MnPS3 can be tailored through the intercalation of different guest molecules. Notably, the insertion of four alkylammonium ions introduces different populations of Mn2+ vacancies, leading to a transition from the pristine antiferromagnetic state to more complex magnetic textures, including a ferrimagnetic state displaying a magnetic saturation of 1 uB/atom. Moreover, we show that the intercalation of few-nm-thick flakes also leads to the emergence of a ferrimagnetic response. This in-flake intercalation, which can be monitored in real time using optical microscopy, can be interrupted before completion, generating lateral heterostructures between pristine and intercalated areas. This approach opens the way to the use of partial intercalation to define regions with distinct magnetic properties within a single flake.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of the lubrication performance of functionalized copolymers interacting with silicon, cobalt, and silver doped diamond-like carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the tribological behavior of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings doped with silicon (Si), cobalt (Co), or silver (Ag) in the presence of an amine-functionalized block copolymer lubricant. Under boundary lubrication, Si-doped DLC (Si-DLC) exhibited the lowest coefficient of friction ($\approx$0.045) and nearly 45% lower wear than undoped DLC. Co-DLC showed moderate improvement, while Ag-DLC provided no significant benefit. Cross-sectional FIB-TEM revealed thin tribofilms, 12-17 nm in thickness, on Si- and Co-doped surfaces. As reported for Si-DLC, these films incorporate copolymer-derived fragments, suggesting a similar composition for Co-DLC. These results indicate that dopant-polymer interactions are key to the development of self-organized boundary layers. To gain atomic-level insight, first-principles calculations were carried out on the adsorption of the dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) unit, the copolymer's functional group. The calculated adsorption energies were $-$2.27 to $-$0.57 eV for Si-DLC, $-$1.73 to $-$1.49 eV for Co(0001), and $-$1.21 to $-$1.08 eV for Ag(111). The order of stability (Si $&gt;$ Co $&gt;$ Ag) was consistent with the experimental tribological ranking. Chemical bonding dominated for Si-DLC, while Ag showed mainly weak physisorption. Simulated pull-off forces further reflected this hierarchy, with N-Si bonds requiring about twice the force of N-Co and nearly five times that of N-Ag. The correspondence between adsorption strength and tribological response highlights the decisive role of dopant species in tribofilm formation. These findings provide guidance for designing durable low-friction surfaces in applications such as electric drivetrains and precision mechanical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ first principles density-functional theory (DFT) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in the framework of tight-binding based maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF-TB) model to investigate the electronic and optical properties of free-standing two-dimensional (2D) germanium dioxide phases. All investigated 2D GeO2 polymorphs exhibit ultra-wide band gaps and strong excitonic effects, with flat O-p-derived valence bands tunable under strain. These features allow the design of flat band materials with ultra large electronic gaps in low-dimensional systems, making these materials promising for devices operation at higher voltages and temperatures than conventional semiconductor materials.</description>

      <title>Metallic Electro-Optic Effect in Twisted Double-Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical advances have highlighted the role of Bloch state intrinsic properties in enabling unconventional electro-optic (EO) phenomena in bulk metals, offering novel strategies for dynamic optical control in quantum materials. Here, we identify an alternative EO mechanism in bulk metallic systems that arises from the interplay between Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons. Focusing on twisted double-bilayer graphene (TDBG), we show that the enhanced intrinsic properties of moir\'e Bloch bands give rise to a sizable linear magnetoelectric EO response, a first-order, electric-field-induced non-Hermitian correction to the gyrotropic magnetic susceptibility. This mechanism dominates in $C_{3z}$-symmetric TDBG, where EO contributions originating from the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) are symmetry-forbidden. Our calculations reveal giant, gate-tunable linear and circular dichroism in the terahertz regime, establishing a robust and tunable platform for ultrafast EO modulation in two-dimensional materials beyond the BCD paradigm.</description>

      <title>Atomic and electronic structure of poly-[Ni(Salen)]: combined study by XPS, UV PES, NEXAFS and DFT methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed study of poly-[Ni(Salen)] polymer in its oxidized (Ox) and reduced (Red) states was conducted using X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and ultraviolet photoemission (UV PES) spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, and quantum-chemical calculations. XPS analysis revealed significant energy shifts (-1.5 to -1.8 eV) and broadening of the PE lines for all atoms upon polymerization, indicating a major redistribution of valence electron density between the monomer fragments. In the oxidized polymer, new features in the Ni 2p and O 1s PE spectra were associated with the formation of polarons with weakened Ni-O bonds; this effect diminished upon reduction as the number of polarons decreased. Quantum-chemical calculations attributed the valence band broadening to enhanced C 2p contributions from $\pi$-conjugation between monomers. NEXAFS spectroscopy confirmed the stability of the ethylenediamine fragment and the direct involvement of the phenolic rings of the salen ligand in polymerization, also revealing a partial weakening and incomplete restoration of the $\pi$ bonding between O and Ni atoms upon reduction. Furthermore, it was shown that it is the $BF_{4}^-$ anions that weaken the Ni-O bonds during oxidation, which are partially preserved in the reduced state.</description>

      <title>Identifying geometric third-order nonlinear transport in disordered materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In third-order nonlinear transport, a voltage can be measured in response to the cube of a driving current as a result of the quantum geometric effects, which has attracted tremendous attention. However, in realistic materials where disorder scattering also contributes to nonlinear transport, identifying the geometric mechanisms remains a challenge. We find a total of 20 mechanisms of third-order nonlinear transport by developing a comprehensive theory that treats the geometric effects and disorder scattering on an equal footing. More importantly, we find that 12 of these mechanisms can be unambiguously identified, by deriving a scaling law that expresses the third-order nonlinear Hall conductivity as a polynomial in the linear longitudinal conductivity. We apply this theory to identify the geometric mechanisms of third-order nonlinear transport in materials both with and without time-reversal symmetry, such as 2D materials, topological materials, and altermagnets. This theory further promotes nonlinear transport as a probe of geometric effects and phase transitions in quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the orbital-dependent electronic states of Cd6Ce, a prototype of strongly correlated rare-earth-based Tsai-type quasicrystals and approximants (ACs) by soft and hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. Our results reveal that the 4f orbitals are predominantly hybridized with the valence-band electrons far from the Fermi level EF, in sharp contrast to the hybridization with conduction electrons at EF seen for the intermetallic Ce-based compounds. This anomalous hybridization effect is likely responsible for the unresolved magnetic ground state in Cd6Ce. These findings suggest that Cd-based ACs, some of which show the multi-step magnetic transitions, provide a new platform for investigating exotic magnetic properties that cannot be understood within the conventional framework of hybridization at EF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topolectrical circuits provide a versatile platform for exploring and simulating modern physical models. However, existing approaches suffer from incomplete programmability and ineffective feature prediction and control mechanisms, hindering the investigation of physical phenomena on an integrated platform and limiting their translation into practical applications. Here, we present a deep learning empowered programmable topolectrical circuits (DLPTCs) platform for physical modeling and analysis. By integrating fully independent, continuous tuning of both on site and off site terms of the lattice Hamiltonian, physics graph informed inverse state design, and immediate hardware verification, our system bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and practical realization. Through flexible control and adiabatic path engineering, we experimentally observe the boundary states without global symmetry in higher order topological systems, their adiabatic phase transitions, and the flat band like characteristic corresponding to Landau levels in the circuit. Incorporating a physics graph informed mechanism with a generative AI model for physics exploration, we realize arbitrary, position controllable on board Anderson localization, surpassing conventional random localization. Utilizing this unique capability with high fidelity hardware implementation, we further demonstrate a compelling cryptographic application: hash based probabilistic information encryption by leveraging Anderson localization with extensive disorder configurations, enabling secure delivery of full ASCII messages.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconductivity in 2H-TaS2 Devices Through in-situ Molecular Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intercalation of guest species into the gap of van der Waals materials often leads to the emergence of intriguing phenomena, such as superconductivity. While intercalation-induced superconductivity has been reported in several bulk crystals, reaching a zero-resistance state in flakes remains challenging. Here, we show a simple method for enhancing the superconducting transition in tens-of-nm thick 2H-TaS2 crystals contacted by gold electrodes through in-situ intercalation. Our approach enables measuring the electrical characteristics of the same flake before and after intercalation, permitting us to precisely identify the effect of the guest species on the TaS2 transport properties. We find that the intercalation of amylamine molecules into TaS2 flakes causes a suppression of the charge density wave and an increase in the superconducting transition, with an onset temperature above 3 K. Additionally, we show that a fully developed zero-resistance state can be achieved in flakes by engineering the conditions of the chemical intercalation. Our findings pave the way for the integration of chemically tailored intercalation compounds in scalable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Bonding Character as a Descriptor for Huang-Rhys Factors in Optically Active Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron phonon coupling of a defect characterized by its Huang Rhys (HR) factor is a crucial metric determining its excited-state dynamics, relevant to defect applications as qubits and quantum emitters. However, HR factors remain challenging to calculate from first principles, complicated by convergence issues in excited-state relaxation and time consuming phonon calculations. Even when calculated, HR factors lack a rational design principle. Here we show that an orbital-based descriptor can be used to rationalize and efficiently estimate HR factors. Combining this descriptor with a ground state deformation technique allows circumventing both excited state relaxation and full phonon calculations. Specifically, our descriptor for HR factors is constructed using bonding character differences obtained from ground state density functional theory, measured using crystal orbital Hamilton populations. We demonstrate this descriptor for prototypical hBN defects and the diamond NV center. This orbital-based descriptor can be potentially used in high throughput computational screening to identify ideal candidates of spin qubits and SPEs.</description>

      <title>AIM: A User-friendly GUI Workflow program for Isotherm Fitting, Mixture Prediction, Isosteric Heat of Adsorption Estimation, and Breakthrough Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adsorption breakthrough modeling often requires complex software environments and scripting, limiting accessibility for many practitioners. We present AIM, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that streamlines fixed-bed adsorption modeling and analysis through an integrated workflow, which includes isotherm fitting, estimation of the enthalpy of adsorption, prediction of mixture behavior, and multicomponent breakthrough simulations. AIM supports 13 isotherm models for isotherm fitting and includes the implementation of Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) (FastIAS) and extended Langmuir models for predicting mixture isotherms. Moreover, the isotherm models can be used to run non-isothermal breakthrough simulations along with isosteric enthalpies of adsorption from the Clausius-Clapeyron and Virial equations. Users can export detailed column and outlet profiles (e.g., composition, temperature) in multiple formats, enhancing reproducibility and data sharing among practitioners. We compared the breakthrough simulation results from the AIM workflow and compared that with the experimental data in the literature for a ternary gas mixture (CO2/H2/N2) and found excellent agreement for outlet compositions and temperature profiles.</description>

      <title>GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has accelerated materials discovery, yet most high-performing models remain black boxes, offering predictions without physical understanding. Here I present GoodRegressor, a general-purpose, C++-based symbolic regression framework that bridges data-driven modeling and physical interpretability. GoodRegressor systematically explores nonlinear transformations and feature interactions across five integrated modules, parser, designer, curator, regressor, and designer as a post-process, to construct compact, physics-consistent analytical models. For example, applied to the experimental activation energy dataset of oxygen-ion conductors, GoodRegressor explored an ensemble-sampled model space comprising approximately $1.44 \times 10^{457}$ possible combinations and achieved superior predictive performance ($\langle R^2 \rangle =0.804$) compared with conventional machine learning methods, outperforming RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge, MLP, and PySR ($\langle R^2 \rangle \leq 0.652$). Unlike black-box models, GoodRegressor reveals transparent structure-property relationships linking ionic transport to coordination environment and lattice flexibility. This interpretable modeling framework mitigates the opacity of conventional ML, enabling hypothesis generation, physical insight, and general applicability to complex scientific systems beyond materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Topological Control of Transition Metal Networks for Reversible High-Capacity Li-rich Cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing high-energy-density batteries is essential for advancing sustainable energy technologies. However, leading cathode materials such as Li-rich oxides, including Li$_2$MnO$_3$, suffer from capacity loss due to irreversible oxygen release and structural degradation, both consequences of the oxygen redox activity that also enables their high capacity. The atomic-scale mechanisms behind this degradation, and whether it can be made reversible, remain open questions. Here, using submicrosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy, we directly visualize the entire charge-discharge cycle of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, uncovering the full lifecycle of the O$_2$-filled nanovoids responsible for degradation and identifying the critical size limit for voids to remain fully repairable upon discharge. Our results reveal that the topology of the Mn cation network is the key factor governing void growth, coalescence, and reparability. Based on a structural topology-informed design principle, we computationally develop a novel Li$_2$MnO$_3$ structure featuring a Mn lattice with a Kagome-like pattern, demonstrating full electrochemical reversibility even under extreme 80% delithiation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-energy cathodes, shifting the focus from mitigating damage to engineering inherent stability through atomic-level topological control of transition metal network.</description>

      <title>All-Altermagnetic Tunnel Junction of RuO2/NiF2/RuO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</description>

      <title>dynsight: an Open Python Platform for Simulation and Experimental Trajectory Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of complex many-body systems via analysis of the trajectories of the units that dynamically move and interact within them is a non-trivial task. The workflow for extracting meaningful information from the raw trajectory data is often composed of a series of interconnected steps, such as, (i) identifying and tracking the constitutive objects/particles, resolving their trajectories (e.g., in experimental cases, where these are not automatically available as in typical molecular simulations), (ii) translating the trajectories into data that are easier to handle/analyze by using well suited descriptors, and (iii) extracting meaningful information from such data. Each of these different tasks often requires non-negligible programming skills, the use of various types of representations or methods, and the availability/development of an interface between them. Despite the considerable potential that new tools contributed to each of these individual steps, their integration under a common framework would decrease the barrier to usage (especially by diverse communities of users), avoid fragmentation, and ultimately facilitate the development of new approaches in data analysis. To this end, here we introduce dynsight, an open Python platform that streamlines the extraction and analysis of time-series data from simulation - or experimentally - resolved trajectories. dynsight simplifies workflows, enhances accessibility, and facilitates time-series and trajectories data analysis offering a useful tool to unraveling the dynamic complexity of a variety of systems (or signals) across different scales. dynsight is open source (https://github.com/GMPavanLab/dynsight) and can be easily installed using pip.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconducting properties of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ films with sub-50-nm thickness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-unit cell thick Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) layers have recently attracted much interest due to their extreme anisotropy and two-dimensional superconductivity, although they are typically susceptible to ambient conditions. In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors.</description>

      <title>Data Fusion of Deep Learned Molecular Embeddings for Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven approaches such as deep learning can result in predictive models for material properties with exceptional accuracy and efficiency. However, in many applications, data is sparse, severely limiting their accuracy and applicability. To improve predictions, techniques such as transfer learning and multitask learning have been used. The performance of multitask learning models depends on the strength of the underlying correlations between tasks and the completeness of the data set. Standard multitask models tend to underperform when trained on sparse data sets with weakly correlated properties. To address this gap, we fuse deep-learned embeddings generated by independent pretrained single-task models, resulting in a multitask model that inherits rich, property-specific representations. By reusing (rather than retraining) these embeddings, the resulting fused model outperforms standard multitask models and can be extended with fewer trainable parameters. We demonstrate this technique on a widely used benchmark data set of quantum chemistry data for small molecules as well as a newly compiled sparse data set of experimental data collected from literature and our own quantum chemistry and thermochemical calculations.</description>

      <title>Tunable hyperbolic Landau-level polaritons in charge-neutral graphene nanoribbon metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Multiscale, Techno-economic Evaluation of Isoreticular Series of CALF-20 for Biogas Upgrading using a Pressure/Vacuum Swing Adsorption (PVSA) Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyclic swing adsorption processes, such as pressure/vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA), are a promising technology for upgrading biogas by separating carbon dioxide (CO2) from methane (CH4). The rational design of adsorbent materials with tailored properties is important for the deployment of high-performance PVSA technology. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly the CALF-20 isoreticular series, have attracted interest due to their high CO2 selectivity, thermal, and water stability. In this study, we report a multiscale assessment of CALF-20 and its isoreticular five derivatives by integrating molecular simulations with PVSA process optimization and techno-economic analysis. Structural and adsorption characteristics were calculated and employed to assess how each material performs in terms of energy efficiency and cost. The analysis reveals distinct differences in cost performance among the CALF-20 series, with CALF-20 showing the most favorable economics with \gt97\% purity CH4 production cost at \$4.31 per kg of CH4 and energy consumption of 9.35 kWh per kg of CH4. This study demonstrates that the integrated molecular-process optimization framework can effectively guide the search for adsorbent materials for biogas upgrading.</description>

      <title>iDART: Interferometric Dual-AC Resonance Tracking nano-electromechanical mapping</title>

Abstract: Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination, iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this work, we demonstrate a &gt;10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films, 2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-Locked Helical Currents and Pure Spin Pumping in Altermagnetic Nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been widely explored in 3D and 2D crystals, but its one-dimensional realization remains largely unexplored. Here we propose an altermagnetic nanotube formed by rolling a 2D altermagnet, which converts momentum-odd spin polarization into spin-chirality locking enforced by the screw axis. Unlike curvature-induced magnetization in bent films, the nanotube is mirror-antisymmetric and produce no net magnetization. Two reciprocal effects emerge: (i) a single-spin injection drives a helical current whose handedness is fixed by the spin, yielding opposite-sign axial magnetic fields; and (ii) a time-varying axial flux generates a circumferential Faraday field that drives equal-magnitude but opposite axial charge currents in the two spin channels, producing a pure spin current under open-circuit conditions. As an implication, spin accumulation programs the tube's handedness and can imprint it onto otherwise achiral coaxial nanotubes in one-dimensional van der Waals assemblies. First-principles results for V2Se2O confirm spin-dependent helical wave functions near both band edges, establishing a nonrelativistic route to spin-programmable chiral nanodevices and compact flux generators/charge-neutral spin injectors without static magnetic bias.</description>

Abstract: Degradation of joint cartilages can result in osteoarthritis (OA) affecting about 10\% of the US population and responsible for significant hospitalization costs. While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages.</description>
