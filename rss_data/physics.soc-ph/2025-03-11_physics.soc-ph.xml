      <title>Did smartphones break the world as we knew it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I overview data on several radical societal changes started circa 2015: accelerated decline in fertility rate, backsliding of democracy, rise of populist politics and arrest in generational renewal of political leadership. I conjecture that all these processes have a common underlying cause: the spread of cheap and easy access to information due to wide spread of smartphones. I speculate about possible mechanisms connecting the observed changes with this underlying information revolution and discuss relevant historical parallels.</description>

      <title>Ranking dynamics of urban mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mobility, a pivotal aspect of urban dynamics, displays a profound and multifaceted relationship with urban sustainability. Despite considerable efforts analyzing mobility patterns over decades, the ranking dynamics of urban mobility has received limited attention. This study aims to contribute to the field by investigating changes in rank and size of hourly inflows to various locations across 60 Chinese cities throughout the day. We find that the rank-size distribution of hourly inflows over the course of the day is stable across cities. To uncover the microdynamics beneath the stable aggregate distribution amidst shifting location inflows, we analyzed consecutive-hour inflow size and ranking variations. Our findings reveal a dichotomy: locations with higher daily average inflow display a clear monotonic trend, with more pronounced increases or decreases in consecutive-hour inflow. In contrast, ranking variations exhibit a non-monotonic pattern, distinguished by the stability of not only the top and bottom rankings but also those in moderately-inflowed locations. Finally, we compare ranking dynamics across cities using a ranking metric, the rank turnover. The results advance our understanding of urban mobility dynamics, providing a basis for applications in urban planning and traffic engineering.</description>

      <title>Does excellence correspond to universal inequality level? Evidences from scholarly citations and Olympic medal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inequality of citations received for different publications of various researchers and Nobel laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine and Economics using their Google Scholar data for the period 2012-2024. Our findings reveal that citation distributions are highly unequal, with even greater disparity among the Nobel laureates. We then show that measures of inequality, such as Gini and Kolkata indices, could be a useful indicator for distinguishing the Nobel laureates from the others. It may be noted, such high level of inequality corresponds to critical point fluctuations, indicating that excellence correspond to (self-organized dynamical) critical point. We also analyze the inequality in the medal tally of different countries in the summer and winter Olympic games over the years, and find that a similar level of high inequality exists there as well. Our results indicate that inequality measures can serve as proxies for competitiveness and excellence.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification and posterior sampling for network reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network reconstruction is the task of inferring the unseen interactions between elements of a system, based only on their behavior or dynamics. This inverse problem is in general ill-posed, and admits many solutions for the same observation. Nevertheless, the vast majority of statistical methods proposed for this task -- formulated as the inference of a graphical generative model -- can only produce a ``point estimate,'' i.e. a single network considered the most likely. In general, this can give only a limited characterization of the reconstruction, since uncertainties and competing answers cannot be conveyed, even if their probabilities are comparable, while being structurally different. In this work we present an efficient MCMC algorithm for sampling from posterior distributions of reconstructed networks, which is able to reveal the full population of answers for a given reconstruction problem, weighted according to their plausibilities. Our algorithm is general, since it does not rely on specific properties of particular generative models, and is specially suited for the inference of large and sparse networks, since in this case an iteration can be performed in time $O(N\log^2 N)$ for a network of $N$ nodes, instead of $O(N^2)$, as would be the case for a more naive approach. We demonstrate the suitability of our method in providing uncertainties and consensus of solutions (which provably increases the reconstruction accuracy) in a variety of synthetic and empirical cases.</description>

      <title>Inequality in a model of capitalist economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze inequality aspects of the agent-based model of capitalist economy named it Social Architecture of Capitalism that has been introduced by Ian Wright. The model contemplates two main types of agents, workers and capitalists, which can also be unemployed. Starting from a state where all agents are unemployed and possess the same initial wealth, the system, governed by a few simple rules, quickly self-organizes into two classes. After a transient, the model reproduces the statistics of many relevant macroeconomic quantities of real economies worldwide, notably the two regimes of the distributions of wealth and income. We perform extensive simulations testing the role of the model parameters (number of agents, total wealth, and salary range) on the resulting distribution of wealth and income, the social distribution of agents, and other stylized facts of the dynamics. Our main finding is that, according to the model, in an economy where total wealth is conserved and with a fixed average wage, the increase in wealth per capita comes with more inequality.</description>

      <title>Effective dimensional reduction of complex systems based on tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exact treatment of Markovian models of complex systems requires knowledge of probability distributions exponentially large in the number of components $n$. Mean-field approximations provide an effective reduction in complexity of the models, requiring only a number of phase space variables polynomial in system size. However, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy close to critical points in the systems dynamics and an inability to capture correlations in the system. In this work, we introduce a tunable approximation scheme for Markovian spreading models on networks based on Matrix Product States (MPS). By controlling the bond dimensions of the MPS, we can investigate the effective dimensionality needed to accurately represent the exact $2^n$ dimensional steady-state distribution. We introduce the entanglement entropy as a measure of the compressibility of the system and find that it peaks just after the phase transition on the disordered side, in line with the intuition that more complex states are at the 'edge of chaos'. We compare the accuracy of the MPS with exact methods on different types of small random networks and with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for a simplified version of the railway network of the Netherlands with 55 nodes. The MPS provides a systematic way to tune the accuracy of the approximation by reducing the dimensionality of the systems state vector, leading to an improvement over second-order mean-field approximations for sufficiently large bond dimensions.</description>
