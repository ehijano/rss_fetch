      <title>Invariant Rings of $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-Representations are not always Finitely Generated in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert's 14th Problem asks the following question. Given a linear representation $ \beta: G \to \operatorname{GL}(\mathbf{V}) $ of a linear algebraic group over a field $ k $ is the ring $ S_{k}(\mathbf{V}^{\ast}) $ a finitely generated $ k $-algebra? For reductive groups the answer is yes. However, in general the answer is no. Nagata provided one of the earliest counterexamples to this claim and his counterexample was extended by Shigeru Mukai. However, if $ G $ is equal to $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $ and the characteristic of $ k $ is equal to zero, then the answer to Hilbert's 14th problem is yes. Roland Weitzenb\"{o}ck first proved this result in 1932 in an article in Acta Mathematica. Seshadri gave a more accessible proof.
  While Roland Weitzenb\"{o}ck did not conjecture this claim, the question of whether the theorem that bears his name still holds if the characteristic of the base field $ k $ is $ p&gt;0 $ is known as ``the Weitzenb\"{o}ck conjecture''. We aim to use Mukai's strategy to give a counterexample to the Weitzenb\"{o}ck conjecture. Namely, we construct a six dimensional representation over a field of positive characteristic such that the invariant ring is isomorphic to the Cox ring of the blow-up of a toric surface at the identity of the torus. We use the geometry of the underlying toric variety to show that this Cox ring is not finitely generated.</description>

      <title>On the Invariant Theory of $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-Actions from a Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give a strict classification of $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-representations. This is done through the notion of a $ c(t) $-pair. Namely if $ \operatorname{Spec}(A) $ is a $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-variety with action $ \beta $, then a $ c(t) $-pair is a pair of elements $ (g,h) $ such that $ g(t_{0} \ast x) = g(x)+c(t_{0}) h(x) $. This allows us to describe exactly when an affine, $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-stable, sub-variety $ D(h) $ is a trivial bundle over $ D(h)//\mathbb{G}_{a} $. If $ \operatorname{Spec}(A) $ is a $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-variety, we define the large pedestal ideal $ \mathfrak{P}_{g}(A) $ and the pedestal ideal $ \mathfrak{P}(A) $. If $ \beta: \mathbb{G}_{a} \to \operatorname{GL}(\mathbf{V}) $ is a $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-representation, then we classify such a representation on whether: a) the large pedestal ideal $ \mathfrak{P}_{g}(S_{k}(\mathbf{V}^{\ast})) $ is equal to zero. b) the large pedestal ideal is non-zero, but the pedestal ideal is equal to zero. or c) the pedestal ideal is non-zero.</description>

      <title>On the Invariant Theory of Unipotent Groups Actions from a Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a generalization of a previous paper by the author to connected unipotent linear algebraic groups. The notion of an $ \alpha $-pair answers when an open $ G $-stable, affine, sub-variety $ D(H) $ is a trivial bundle over $ G \backslash \backslash D(H) $ in the Zariski topology, or whether there is an fppf topology $ \phi: U \to D(H) $ such that $ U $ is a trivial bundle over $ G \backslash \backslash U $ and such that the fibres $ \phi^{-1}(x) \cong \ker(\alpha) $. We also describe a generalization of van den Essen's algorithm for quasi-principle $ G $-varieties $ \operatorname{Spec}(A) $.</description>

Abstract: We show that saturated base change of a dominant toroidal morphism is also toroidal. For completeness, we give full details on equivalence between definitions regarding toroidal embeddings and toroidal morphisms in literature. Moreover, we show in detail the equivalence between toroidal embeddings and logarithmically regular log-varieties, respectively, toroidal morphisms and logarithmically smooth morphisms.</description>

      <title>Approximate Fiber Products of Schemes and Their \'Etale Homotopical Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing the geometric structure of semantic spaces in modern large language models, whose foundational architecture is the Transformer. The token spaces of these models are fundamentally arithmetic, and recent work has revealed complex geometric singularities, challenging the classical manifold hypothesis.
  This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of \'etale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \'etale mismatch torsor, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic measure of the global relationship between the two morphisms.
  Our main theorem provides a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first \'etale cohomology group $H^1_{\text{\'et}}(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{\'et}}(S)})$. This result yields a discrete, algebraic invariant that replaces the non-intrinsic, metric-based notions of approximation first explored in applied contexts. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields to illustrate its connection to classical problems. This work introduces new homotopical invariants to arithmetic geometry, opening new avenues for the structural analysis of complex discrete systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider reductions of Selmer sections of the \'etale homotopy sequence of a hyperbolic curve over a number field. We show that the conjugacy class of a noncuspidal Selmer section is uniquely determined by its reduction on a set of density one. Moreover, we show that a noncuspidal Selmer section reduces to cusps only on a set of density zero, at least after a finite field extension.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we aim to prove the finite semi-algebraic chamber decomposition theorem for K-semi(poly)stability under the assumption of the log boundedness of K-semistable degenerations. This boundedness assumption is naturally arising from the finiteness of K-moduli compactifications.</description>

      <title>On a Dichotomy for Skyscraper Sheaves under the Bridgeland-King-Reid Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G \subset SL_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a finite abelian subgroup, and let $Y = G\operatorname{-}\mathrm{Hilb}(\mathbb{C}^3)$ be the corresponding $G$-Hilbert scheme. Denote by $\Psi: D^b_G(\mathrm{Coh}(\mathbb{C}^3)) \to D^b(\mathrm{Coh}(Y))$ the Bridgeland--King--Reid derived equivalence. For a nontrivial character $\chi$ of $G$, let $\chi^!$ be the corresponding skyscraper sheaf supported at the origin. It is known that $\Psi(\chi^!)$ is always a pure sheaf supported either in degree $0$ or in degree $-1$. We prove that the proportion of characters $\chi$ for which $\Psi(\chi^!)$ is supported in degree $0$ is a rational number lying between $0.25$ and $1$, with both bounds being sharp. Moreover, we exhibit families of resolutions for which these proportions attain certain explicit values within this range.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing invariants in $G$-equivariant birational geometry by unifying two recent approaches: the \emph{theory of atoms} recently developed by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, and the theory of \emph{modular symbols} due to Kontsevich, Tschinkel, and Pestun.
  We initiate the theory of Chen-Ruan atoms. Assuming the blowup formula for the quantum Chen-Ruan cohomology, we outline how to extend the theory of atoms to global quotient orbifolds and present some striking applications.
  In addition, we develop a separate class of purely geometric invariants for $\mathbb{Z}/2$- and $\mathbb{Z}/3$-actions on surfaces and threefolds.
  We provide many examples of non-$G$-linearizable $G$-actions on projective varieties treated with these new techniques.</description>

      <title>Regular homomorphisms and mixed motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $d$ over an algebraically closed field $k$. The main goal of this paper is to study, in the context of Voevodsky's triangulated category of motives $DM_k$, the group $CH^n_{\mathrm{alg}}(X)$ of codimension $n$ algebraic cycles of $X$, algebraically equivalent to zero, modulo rational equivalence, $1\leq n \leq d$. Namely, for any regular homomorphism $\psi$ (in the sense of Samuel) defined on $CH^n_{\mathrm{alg}}(X)$, we construct $M^n_{\psi}(X)\in DM_k$, which is a reasonable approximation, with respect to the slice filtration in $DM_k$, of the motive of $X$, $M(X)$; and a map $z_\psi : M^n_{\psi}(X)\rightarrow M(X)$ in $DM_k$, which computes the kernel of $\psi$. We construct as well a map, $z_{\mathrm{ab}}^n: M^n_{\mathrm{ab}}(X) \rightarrow M(X)$ having analogue properties but which instead computes the subgroup $CH^n_{\mathrm{ab}}(X)\subseteq CH^n_{\mathrm{alg}}(X)$ of algebraic cycles abelian equivalent to zero (in the sense of Samuel).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Brauer groups of affine surfaces that are complements of singular hyperplane sections of smooth cubic surfaces over a field $k$ of characteristic $0$. We determine the Brauer group over the algebraic closure as a Galois module for all the possible singular hyperplane sections. For the case when the hyperplane section is geometrically the union of three lines and $k=\mathbb{Q}$, we give examples where the Galois invariant part descends to $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Brauer groups of regular conic bundles over elliptic curves defined over a number field $k$. We explicitly compute the Brauer group of the conic bundle when the singular fibres lie above $k$-points that are divisible by $2$ in $E(k)$, and the corresponding ramification fields are isomorphic. We apply the result to compute the Brauer group of a class of surfaces analogous to that of Ch\^{a}telet surfaces. We investigate Brauer-Manin obstructions to weak approximation coming from the real places on such surfaces.</description>

      <title>Entropy approximations of algebraic matroids over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of entropy polymatroids associated with algebraic matroids over finite fields. Given an algebraic matroid ${\sf M}:=(\mathcal{E},r)$ and the irreducible variety $V$ associated with ${\sf M}$, we consider the polymatroid $h_{\mathbb{F}}$ induced by the entropies of the projections of $V(\mathbb{F})$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{G}$. Revisiting a construction of Mat\'u$\check{\mathrm{s}}$, we show that the polymatroid $h_{\mathbb{F}}$ converges to the rank function $r$ of ${\sf M}$ as $q:=|\mathbb{F}|$ tends to infinity.
  Our main contribution is to make this convergence quantitative: we derive explicit uniform error bounds for the deviation $|h_\mathbb{F}-r|$, expressed in terms of the degree of $V$, the ground set size $|\mathcal{E}|$, the rank $r(\mathcal{E})$, and $q$. The proofs combine tools of algebraic geometry (effective Lang-Weil estimates and intrinsic degree bounds for annihilating polynomials of circuits) with information-theoretic arguments (submodularity of entropy and conditional entropy estimates).
  These results provide the first effective and uniform approximation bounds for algebraic matroids by entropy polymatroids, clarifying the quantitative link between algebraic independence (captured by matroid rank) and information-theoretic independence (captured by entropy).</description>

      <title>FedHK-MVFC: Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory with federated healthcare analytics. Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced communication, and $98.2 \%$ efficiency retention over centralized methods. Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data. Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence, adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, turning advanced math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give in this paper a survey of results obtained in our earlier papers, and state explicitly some problems of further research, for example: are the analytic ranks bounded, or not? Twists of Carlitz modules are parametrized by polynomials over finite fields $\Bbb F_q$. The analytic rank of a twist is the order of zero of its L-function at a point. The set of polynomials of degree $\le m$ such that the analytic ranks of the corresponding twists are $\ge i$ is $X(m,i)(\Bbb F_q)$ where $X(m,i)$ is an affine variety defined over $\Bbb F_p$ (we do not know what is its dimension). We consider also a related invariant of a twist, namely, the behaviour of its L-function at infinity (the rank at infinity). We know much more on varieties corresponding to twists of a fixed rank at infinity and on their lifts from $\Bbb F_p$ to $\Bbb Z$ . For example, for $q=2$ the irreducible components of these varieties are described in terms of finite rooted weighted binary trees. A similar description for $q&gt;2$ is not found yet.</description>

      <title>Towards the dual motivic Steenrod algebra in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:1711.05230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dual motivic Steenrod algebra with mod $\ell$ coefficients was computed by Voevodsky over a base field of characteristic zero, and by Hoyois, Kelly, and {\O}stv{\ae}r over a base field of characteristic $p \neq \ell$. In the case $p = \ell$, we show that the conjectured answer is a retract of the actual answer. We also describe the slices of the algebraic cobordism spectrum $MGL$: we show that the conjectured form of $s_n MGL$ is a retract of the actual answer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.07905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Jordan observed in 1870, just as univariate polynomials have Galois groups, so do problems in enumerative geometry. Despite this pedigree, the study of Galois groups in enumerative geometry was dormant for a century, with a systematic study only occuring in the past 15 years. We discuss the current directions of this study, including open problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Universal families of twisted cotangent bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a complex algebraic group $G$ and complex $G$-variety $X$, one can study the affine Hamiltonian Lagrangian (AHL) $G$-bundles over $X$. Lisiecki indexes the isomorphism classes of such bundles in the case of a homogeneous $G$-variety $X=G/H$; the indexing set is the set of $H$-fixed points $(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H\subset\mathfrak{h}^*$, where $\mathfrak{h}$ is the Lie algebra of $H$. In very rough terms, one may regard $\psi\in(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H$ as labeling the isomorphism class of a $\psi$-twisted cotangent bundle of $G/H$. These twisted cotangent bundles feature prominently in geometric representation theory and symplectic geometry.
  We introduce and examine the notion of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a $G$-variety $X$, as part of a broader program on Lie-theoretic and incidence-theoretic constructions of regular Poisson varieties. This family is defined to be a flat family $\pi:\mathcal{U}\longrightarrow Y$, in which $\mathcal{U}$ is a Poisson variety, the fibers of $\pi$ form a complete list of representatives of the isomorphism classes of AHL $G$-bundles over $X$, and other pertinent properties are satisfied. Our first main result is the construction of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a homogeneous base $X=G/H$, for connected $H$. In our second main result, we take $X$ to be a conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of self-normalizing closed subgroups of $G$. We associate to $\mathcal{C}$ a regular Poisson variety $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$, defined in incidence-theoretic terms. Attention is paid to the case of conjugacy classes of normalizers of symmetric subgroups. In the case of a connected semisimple group $G$ and conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of parabolic subgroups, our third main result relates $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$ to the partial Grothendieck-Springer resolution for $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01154v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,B)$ be an $\epsilon$-lc pair of dimension $d$ with a closed point $x\in X$. Birkar and Shokurov conjectured that there is an effective Cartier divisor $H$ passing through $x$ such that $(X,B+tH)$ is lc near $x$, where $t$ is a positive real number depending only on $d,\epsilon$. We prove that this conjecture is equivalent to Shokurov's conjecture on boundedness of klt complements on Fano fibrations and we confirm it in dimension 2. As a corollary, we prove the boundedness of klt complements on Fano fibrations over surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We prove that fields of meromorphic functions on Stein surfaces have cohomological dimension 2, and solve the period-index problem and Serre's conjecture II for these fields. We obtain analogous results for fields of real meromorphic functions on Stein surfaces equipped with an antiholomorphic involution. We deduce an optimal quantitative solution to Hilbert's 17th problem on analytic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic differentials and twisted DR hierarchies for the Hodge CohFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [arXiv:2408.13806], two families of classical and quantum integrable hierarchies associated to arbitrary Cohomological Field Theories (CohFTs) were introduced: the meromorphic differential and twisted double ramification hierarchies. For trivial CohFT, the authors established a connection with the untwisted Double Ramification (DR) hierarchy. In this paper, we extend this study to the Hodge CohFT and prove an analogous correspondence with the untwisted DR hierarchy. This yields non-trivial identities between Hodge integrals over the DR cycle, the twisted DR cycle and the cycle of meromorphic differentials.</description>

      <title>Computations in equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of GKM spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants and quantum cohomology in GKM theory. Building on the localization formula, we prove that the resulting expression is independent of the choice of compatible connection, and provide an equivalent formulation without auxiliary choices. Motivated by this theoretical refinement, we develop a software package, $\mathtt{GKMtools . jl}$, that implements the computation of equivariant GW invariants and quantum products directly from the GKM graph. We apply our framework to several geometric settings: Calabi-Yau rank two vector bundles on the projective line, where we obtain a new proof for a recent connection to Donaldson-Thomas theory of Kronecker quivers; twisted flag manifolds, which give symplectic but non-algebraic examples of GKM spaces; realizability questions for abstract GKM graphs; and classical enumerative problems involving curves in hyperplanes. These results demonstrate both the theoretical flexibility of GKM methods and the effectiveness of computational tools in exploring new phenomena.</description>

      <title>The Integral Chow Rings of the Moduli Stacks of Hyperelliptic Prym Pairs III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the third and final part of a series devoted to the description of the integral Chow rings of the moduli stacks of hyperelliptic Prym pairs. For a fixed genus $g$, there are two natural stacks, $\mathcal{RH}_g$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g$, parametrizing hyperelliptic Prym pairs, with the former being the $\mu_2$-rigidification of the latter. Both decompose as the disjoint union of $\lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$ components, denoted $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g^n$ for $n = 1, \ldots, \lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$. In this paper we present quotient stack descriptions of the components $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ for even $g$ and compute their integral Chow rings, thereby completing the computation for all irreducible components of $\mathcal{RH}_g$. In addition, we give quotient stack presentations for all irreducible components of $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g$ and determine when the rigidification map $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g^n \to \mathcal{RH}_g^n$ is a root gerbe. We then use this to compute the Chow rings of $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g^n$ for all $g$ and $n$, with the sole exception of the case where $g$ is odd and $n=(g+1)/2$.
  Finally, in the appendix, we discuss $G$-gerbes induced by an homomorphism of abelian groups $H \to G$ and an $H$-gerbe.</description>

      <title>Mixed Hodge modules and real groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.08797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a complex reductive group, $\theta \colon G \to G$ an involution, and $K = G^\theta$. In arXiv:1206.5547, W. Schmid and the second named author proposed a program to study unitary representations of the corresponding real form $G_\mathbb{R}$ using $K$-equivariant twisted mixed Hodge modules on the flag variety of $G$ and their polarizations. In this paper, we make the first significant steps towards implementing this program. Our first main result gives an explicit combinatorial formula for the Hodge numbers appearing in the composition series of a standard module in terms of the Lusztig-Vogan polynomials. Our second main result is a polarized version of the Jantzen conjecture, stating that the Jantzen forms on the composition factors are polarizations of the underlying Hodge modules. Our third main result states that, for regular Beilinson-Bernstein data, the minimal $K$-type of an irreducible Harish-Chandra module lies in the lowest piece of the Hodge filtration of the corresponding Hodge module. An immediate consequence of our results is a Hodge-theoretic proof of the signature multiplicity formula of arXiv:1212.2192, which was the inspiration for this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The character variety $\Xi$ of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ has many compactifications. We construct a continuous surjection from the real spectrum compactification $\Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ to the oriented Gromov equivariant compactification. Our construction is based on a geometric interpretation of the elements of $\partial \Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ as $\Gamma$-actions by isometries on $\mathbb{R}$-trees. We endow these $\mathbb{R}$-trees with an orientation induced by the standard orientation on the circle, which we characterize by a semialgebraic equation. Moreover, we describe the $\Gamma$-actions by orientation preserving isometries on oriented $\mathbb{R}$-trees, which arise in both compactifications, as limits of $\Gamma$-actions on the oriented hyperbolic plane, via asymptotic cones endowed with an ultralimit orientation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the decomposition into irreducible components of the fixed point locus under the action of $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ of the smooth Nakajima quiver variety of the Jordan quiver. The quiver variety associated with the Jordan quiver is either isomorphic to the punctual Hilbert scheme in $\mathbb{C}^2$ or to the Calogero-Moser space. We describe the irreducible components using quiver varieties of McKay's quiver associated with the finite subgroup $\Gamma$ and we have given a general combinatorial model of the indexing set of these irreducible components in terms of certain elements of the root lattice of the affine Lie algebra associated with $\Gamma$. Finally, we prove that for every projective, symplectic resolution of a wreath product singularity, there exists an irreducible component of the fixed point locus of the punctual Hilbert scheme in the plane that is isomorphic to the resolution.</description>

Abstract: We develop new techniques in order to deal with Riccati-type equations, subject to a further algebraic constraint, on Riemannian manifolds $(M^3,g)$. We find that the obstruction to solve the aforementioned equation has order $4$ in the metric coefficients and is fully described by an homogeneous polynomial in $\mathrm{Sym}^{16}TM$. Techniques from real algebraic geometry, reminiscent of those used for the "PositiveStellen-Satz " problem, allow determining the geometry in terms of the connection coefficients and a class of Hessian-type equations. Analysis of the latter shows flatness for the metric $g$; in particular we complete the classification of asymptotically harmonic manifolds of dimension $3$, establishing those are either flat or real hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a prime $p$ congruent to three modulo four, we prove that there exists a smooth curve of genus five in characteristic $p$ that is supersingular. We produce this curve as an unramified double cover of a curve of genus three. We conjecture that the setting of unramified double covers of curves of genus three also produces supersingular curves of genus five when $p$ is congruent to one modulo four, and we computationally verify this conjecture for primes less than $100$. These results can be viewed as a generalization of work of Ekedahl and of Harashita, Kudo, and Senda.</description>

      <title>The Likelihood Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An arrangement of hypersurfaces in projective space is strict normal crossing (SNC) if and only if its Euler discriminant is nonzero. We study the critical loci of arbitrary Laurent monomials in the equations of the smooth hypersurfaces. The family of these loci forms an irreducible variety in the product of two projective spaces, known in algebraic statistics as the likelihood correspondence and in particle physics as the scattering correspondence. We establish an explicit determinantal representation for the minimal generators of the bihomogeneous prime ideal that defines this variety.</description>

      <title>Hodge theory, intertwining functors, and the Orbit Method for real reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hodge filtrations of Schmid and Vilonen on unipotent representations of real reductive groups. We show that for various well-defined classes of unipotent representations (including, for example, the oscillator representations of metaplectic groups, the minimal representations of all simple groups, and all unipotent representations of complex groups) the Hodge filtration coincides with the quantization filtration predicted by the Orbit Method. We deduce a number of longstanding conjectures about such representations, including a proof that they are unitary and a description of their $K$-types in terms of co-adjoint orbits. The proofs rely heavily on certain good homological properties of the Hodge filtrations on weakly unipotent representations, which are established using a Hodge-theoretic upgrade of the Beilinson-Bernstein theory of intertwining functors for $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the flag variety. The latter consists of an action of the affine Hecke algebra on a category of filtered monodromic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, which we use to compare Hodge filtrations coming from different localizations of the same representation. As an application of the same methods, we also prove a new cohomology vanishing theorem for mixed Hodge modules on partial flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Formal Manifold Structures on Positive Characteristic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his 1970 ICM report, Sullivan proposes the program of l-adic formalization of the concept of manifolds. In this program, he claims that smooth positive characteristic varieties should carry l-adic formal manifold structures. He also claims the existence of an abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures. This paper carries out this program, establishes the claims for certain varieties, and relates the abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures to the Galois symmetry of varieties. Meanwhile, we prove that a simply-connected variety is l-adic homotopic equivalent to a simply-connected finite CW complex if and only if the l-profinite completion of its etale homotopy type admits an l-local lifting.</description>

      <title>Tensor Forms of Derivatives of Matrices and their applications in the Solutions to Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and extend the outer product and contractive product of tensors and matrices, and present some identities in terms of these products. We offer tensor expressions of derivatives of tensors, focus on the tensor forms of derivatives of a matrix w.r.t. another matrix. This tensor form makes possible for us to unify ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with partial differential equations (PDEs), and facilitates solution to them in some cases. For our purpose, we also extend the outer product and contractive product of tensors (matrices) to a more general case through any partition of the modes, present some identities in terms of these products, initialize the definition of partial Tucker decompositions (TuckD) of a tensor, and use the partial TuckD to simplify the PDEs. We also present a tensor form for the Lyapunov function. Our results in the products of tensors and matrices help us to establish some important equalities on the derivatives of matrices and tensors. An algorithm based on the partial Tucker decompositions (TuckD) to solve the PDEs is given, and a numerical example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>
