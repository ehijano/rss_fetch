      <title>Two Absolutely Irreducible Polynomials over $\Bbb F_2$ and Their Applications to a Conjecture by Carlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two polynomials $F_k(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ and $\Theta_k(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ over $\Bbb F_2$ arose from the study of a conjecture by C. Carlet about the sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$. Both $F_k$ and $\Theta_k$ are homogeneous and symmetric with $\text{deg}\,F_k=2^k-2$ and $\text{deg}\,\Theta_k=2^{k-1}$. It is known that $F_k$ is absolutely irreducible for $k\ge 3$. Using the Lang-Weil bound and a curious connection between $F_k$ and $\Theta_k$, we show that $\Theta_k$ ($k\ge 3$) is also absolutely irreducible. This conclusion allows us to improve several existing results about Carlet's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Some $q$-hypergeometric identities associated with partition theorems of Lebesgue, Schur and Capparelli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we establish a polynomial identity in three variables $a, b, c$, and with the degree of the polynomial given in terms of two integers $L, M$. By letting $L$ and $M$ tend to infinity, we get the 1993 Alladi-Gordon $q$-hypergeometric key-identity for the generalized Schur Theorem as well as the fundamental Lebesgue identity by two different choices of the variables. This polynomial identity provides a generalization and a unified approach to the Schur and Lebesgue theorems. We discuss other analytic identities for the Lebesgue and Schur theorems and also provide a key identity ($q$-hypergeometric) for Andrews' deep refinement of the Alladi-Schur theorem. Finally, we discuss a new infinite hierarchy of identities, the first three of which relate to the partition theorems of Euler, Lebesgue, and Capparelli, and provide their polynomial versions as well.</description>

      <title>Equivariant primitives of Eisenstein series for congruence subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equivariant primitives of Eisenstein series for principal congruence subgroups and show that they are precisely the corresponding non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. We present closed formulas that naturally generalise existing results for the full modular group. We also focus on Eisenstein series of weight two in the case where the modular curve has genus zero. We show that in those cases the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight two can be written as single-valued logarithms whose argument is a rational function of the Hauptmodul.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field $K$ and let $A^{\vee}$ be the dual abelian variety. For an odd prime $p$, we consider two Selmer groups attached to $A[p]$ and relate the orders of these groups along with those of their corresponding duals to the order of the component groups of $A^{\vee}$ at primes $v$.</description>

      <title>Fourier optimization and pair correlation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generic framework to provide bounds related to the pair correlation of sequences belonging to a wide class. We consider analogues of Montgomery's form factor for zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the case of arbitrary sequences satisfying some basic assumptions, and connect their estimation to two extremal problems in Fourier analysis, which are promptly studied. As applications, we provide average bounds of form factors related to some sequences of number theoretic interest, such as the zeros of primitive elements of the Selberg class, Dedekind zeta functions, and the real and imaginary parts of the Riemann zeta function. In the last case, our results bear an implication to a conjecture of Gonek and Ki (2018), showing it cannot hold in some situations.</description>

      <title>Algebraic cycles and values of Green's functions I- Products of Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gross and Zagier defined certain `higher Green's functions' on products of modular curves and conjectured that the value of these functions at complex multiplication points should be logarithms of algebraic numbers. This is now a theorem of Li. We relate this question to the existence of motivic cycles in the universal family of products of elliptic curves along the lines of Mellit and Zhang. We then construct infinitely many such cycles. In the appendix we work out an example of algebraicity.
  The work of Li, Bruinier-Ehlen-Yang, Viazovska and others relate this conjecture to Borcherds' lifts of weakly holomorphic modular forms. This suggests that there should be a link between motivic cycles in the universal family on the one hand and Borcherds' lifts on the other. We formulate a precise conjecture relating the two objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the divisibility properties of \sigma(C_n), the sum-of-divisors function applied to Catalan numbers, in relation to other number-theoretic functions. We establish conditions under which C_n has prime factors of the form 6k-1, derive sufficient criteria for divisibility of \sigma(C_n), and explore asymptotic estimates for the growth of \sigma(C_n) using de Bruijn's theorem. These results provide new insights into the arithmetic structure of Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>Almost periodic stochastic processes with applications to analytic number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical fact of the theory of almost periodic functions is the existence of their asymptotic distributions. In probabilistic terms, this means that if $f$ is a Besicovitch almost periodic function and $V$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on $[-1,1]$, then the random variables $f(L\cdot V)$ converge in distribution, as $L\to\infty$, to a proper non-degenerate random variable. We prove a functional extension of this result for the random processes $(f(L\cdot V+t))_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ in the space of Besicovitch almost periodic functions, and also in the sense of weak convergence of finite-dimensional distributions. We further investigate the properties of the limiting stationary process and demonstrate applications in analytic number theory by extending the one-dimensional results of [Limiting distributions of the classical error terms of prime number theory, Quart. J. Math. 65 (2014), 743--780] and earlier works.</description>

Abstract: We derive a relative version of the local monodromy theorem for ordinary differential equations on an annulus over a mixed-characteristic nonarchimedean field, and give several applications in $p$-adic cohomology and $p$-adic Hodge theory. These include a simplified proof of the semistable reduction theorem for overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, a relative version of Berger's theorem that de Rham representations are potentially semistable, and a multivariate version of the local monodromy theorem in the style of Drinfeld's lemma on fundamental groups.</description>

Abstract: We compute the expected value of Dirichlet $L$-functions defined over $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$ attached to cubic characters evaluated at an arbitrary $s \in (0,1)$. We find a transition term at the point $s=\frac{1}{3}$, reminiscent of the transition at the point $s=\frac{1}{2}$ of the bound for the size of an $L$-function implied by the Lindel\"of hypothesis. We show that at $s=\frac{1}{3}$, the expected value matches corresponding statistics of the group of unitary matrices multiplied by a weight function.</description>

      <title>A Method for Finding All Permutiples with a Fixed Set of Digits from a Single Known Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A permutiple is a natural number that is a nontrivial multiple of a permutation of its digits in some base. Special cases of permutiples include cyclic numbers (multiples of cyclic permutations of their digits) and palintiple numbers (multiples of their digit reversals). While cyclic numbers have a fairly straightforward description, palintiple numbers admit many varieties and cases. A previous paper attempts to get a better handle on the general case by constructing new examples of permutiples with the same set of digits, multiplier, and length as a known example. However, the results are not sufficient for finding all possible examples except when the multiplier divides the base. Using an approach based on the methods of this previous paper, we develop a new method which enables us to find all examples under any conditions.</description>

      <title>Improved lower bounds for strong $n$-conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known $abc$-conjecture concerns triples $(a,b,c)$ of non-zero integers that are coprime and satisfy ${a+b+c=0}$. The strong $n$-conjecture is a generalisation to $n$ summands where integer solutions of the equation ${a_1 + \ldots + a_n = 0}$ are considered such that the $a_i$ are pairwise coprime and satisfy a certain subsum condition. Ramaekers studied a variant of this conjecture with a slightly different set of conditions. He conjectured that in this setting the limit superior of the so-called qualities of the admissible solutions equals $1$ for any $n$.
  In this article, we follow results of Konyagin and Browkin. We restrict to a smaller, and thus more demanding, set of solutions, and improve the known lower bounds on the limit superior: for ${n \geq 6}$ we achieve a lower bound of $\frac54$; for odd $n \geq 5$ we even achieve $\frac53$. In particular, Ramaekers's conjecture is false for every ${n \ge 5}$.</description>

      <title>Monogenic Even Cyclic Sextic Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that $f(x)\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$ is monic and irreducible over ${\mathbb Q}$ of degree $N$. We say that $f(x)$ is monogenic if $\{1,\theta,\theta^2,\ldots ,\theta^{N-1}\}$ is a basis for the ring of integers of ${\mathbb Q}(\theta)$, where $f(\theta)=0$, and we say $f(x)$ is cyclic if the Galois group of $f(x)$ over ${\mathbb Q}$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order $N$. In this note, we prove that there do not exist any monogenic even cyclic sextic binomials or trinomials. Although the complete story on monogenic even cyclic sextic quadrinomials remains somewhat of a mystery, we nevertheless determine that the union of three particular infinite sets of cyclic sextic quadrinomials contains exactly four quadrinomials that are monogenic with distinct splitting fields. We also show that the situation can be quite different for quadrinomials whose Galois group is not cyclic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.14099v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that singularities with holomorphic monodromies are preserved by the Hadamard product. We find an explicit formula for the monodromy of the singularities, and similar formulas for the exponential e\~ne product. Using these formulas we get new direct proofs of classical results and the invariance of some rings of functions by Hadamard and e\~ne product (which is the product of the big Witt ring). This explains the good behavior of the e\~ne product on divisors.</description>

Abstract: We provide new improved lower bounds for the Hodge and Frobenius colevels of algebraic varieties (over $\mathbf{C}$ or over a finite field) in all cohomological degrees. These bounds are expressed in terms of the dimension of the variety and multi-degrees of its defining equations. Our results lead to an enhanced positive answer to a question raised by Esnault and the first author.</description>

Abstract: Natural numbers which are nontrivial multiples of some permutation of their base-$b$ digit representations are called permutiples. Specific cases include numbers which are multiples of cyclic permutations (cyclic numbers) and reversals of their digits (palintiples). Previous efforts have produced methods which construct new examples of permutiples with the same set of digits as a known example. Using simple graph-theoretical and finite-state machine constructions, we advance previous work by describing two methods for finding permutiples of a known base and multiplier with no need for known examples or prior knowledge of digits.</description>
