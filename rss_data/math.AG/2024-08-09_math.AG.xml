      <title>L\"uroth's theorem for fields of rational functions in infinitely many permuted variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L\"uroth's theorem describes the dominant maps from rational curves over a field.
  In this note we study the dominant maps from cartesian powers $X^{\Psi}$ of absolutely irreducible varieties $X$ over a field $k$ for infinite sets $\Psi$ that are equivariant with respect to all permutations of the factors $X$. At least some of such maps arise as compositions $h:X^{\Psi}\xrightarrow{f^{\Psi}}Y^{\Psi}\to H\backslash Y^{\Psi}$, where $X\xrightarrow{f}Y$ is a dominant $k$-map and $H$ is an automorphism group $H$ of $Y|k$, acting diagonally on $Y^{\Psi}$.
  In characteristic 0, we show that this construction, when properly modified, gives all dominant equivariant maps from $X^{\Psi}$, if $\dim X=1$. For arbitrary $X$, the results are only partial.
  In a subsequent paper, the `quasicoherent' equivariant sheaves on the targets of such $h$'s will be studied. Some preliminary results have already appeared in arXiv:math/2205.15144.
  A somewhat similar problem is to check, whether the irreducible invariant subvarieties of $X^{\Psi}$ arise as pullbacks under $f^{\Psi}$ (for appropriate $f$'s) of subvarieties of $Y$ diagonally embedded into $Y^{\Psi}$. This would be a complement to the famous theorem of D.E.Cohen on the noetherian property of the symmetric ideals. We show that this is the case if $\dim X=1$.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the Hesse derivative on the $j$-invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $j$-invariant of a cubic curve is an isomorphism invariant parameterized by the moduli space of elliptic curves. The Hesse derivative of a curve $V(f)$ given by the homogeneous polynomial $f$ is $V(\mathcal{H}(f))$ where $\mathcal{H}(f)$ is a the determinant of the Hesse matrix of $f$. In this paper, we compute the $j$-invariant of the Hesse derivative of a cubic curve $C$ in terms of the $j$-invariant of $C$, getting a rational function on the Riemann sphere. We then analyze the dynamics of this rational function, and investigate when a cubic curve is isomorphic to its $n$-fold Hesse derivative.</description>

      <title>On the irregular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original Riemann-Hilbert problem asks to find a Fuchsian ordinary differential equation with prescribed singularities and monodromy in the complex line. In the early 1980's Kashiwara solved a generalized version of the problem, valid on complex manifolds of any dimension. He presented it as a correspondence between regular holonomic D-modules and perverse sheaves.
  The analogous problem where one drops the regularity condition remained open for about thirty years. We solved it in the paper that received a 2024 Frontiers of Science Award. Our construction requires in particular an enhancement of the category of perverse sheaves. Here, using some examples in dimension one, we wish to convey the gist of the main ingredients used in our work.
  This is a written account of a talk given by the first named author at the International Congress of Basic Sciences on July 2024 in Beijing.</description>

      <title>The intrinsic reductions and the intrinsic depths in non-archimedean dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a rational function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ defined over an algebraically closed and complete non-archimedean non-trivially valued field $K$, we introduce the intrinsic reduction at each point in the Berkovich projective line and the directionwise intrinsic depth of it. After discussing the relationship between such an intrinsic reduction of $\phi$ and the classical reduction of $\phi$ modulo $K^{\circ\circ}$, we give as applications an intrinsic proof of Rumely's moduli theoretic characterization of the minimum resultant locus and a direct proof of the degenerating limit theorem of DeMarco--Faber for a meromorphic family of complex rational functions.</description>

      <title>Rational Curves on Real Classical Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with rational curves on real classical groups. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We determine the structure of quadratic rational curves on real classical groups. As a consequence, we completely classify quadratic rational curves on $\mathrm{U}_n$, $\mathrm{O}_n(\mathbb{R})$, $\mathrm{O}_{n-1,1}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{O}_{n-2,2}(\mathbb{R})$. (ii) We prove a decomposition theorem for rational curves on real classical groups, which can be regarded as a non-commutative generalization of the fundamental theorem of algebra and partial fraction decomposition. (iii) As an application of (i) and (ii), we generalize Kempe's Universality Theorem to rational curves on homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>$\ell$-away ACM line bundles on a nonsingular cubic surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X \subset \mathbb P^3$ be a nonsingular cubic hypersurface. Faenzi (\cite{F}) and later Pons-Llopis and Tonini (\cite{PLT}) have completely characterized ACM line bundles over $X$. As a natural continuation of their study in the non-ACM direction, in this paper, we completely classify $\ell$-away ACM line bundles (introduced recently by Gawron and Genc (\cite{GG})) over $X$, when $\ell \leq 2$. For $\ell\geq 3$, we give examples of $\ell$-away ACM line bundles on $X$ and for each $\ell \geq 1$, we establish the existence of smooth hypersurfaces $X^{(d)}$ of degree $d &gt;\ell$ in $\mathbb P^3$ admitting $\ell$-away ACM line bundles.</description>

      <title>On compact complex surfaces with finite homotopy rank-sum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological space (not necessarily simply connected) is said to have finite homotopy rank-sum if the sum of the ranks of all higher homotopy groups (from the second homotopy group onward) is finite. In this article, we characterize the smooth compact complex Kaehler surfaces having finite homotopy rank-sum. We also prove the Steinness of the universal cover of these surfaces assuming holomorphic convexity of the universal cover.</description>

      <title>Approximability and Rouquier dimension for noncommuative algebras over schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with approximability (via Neeman) and Rouquier dimension for triangulated categories associated to noncommutative algebras over schemes. Amongst other things, we establish that the category of perfect complexes of a coherent algebra over a separated Noetherian scheme is strongly generated if, and only if, there exists an affine open cover where the algebra has finite global dimension. As a consequence, we solve an open problem posed by Neeman. Further, as a first application, we study the existence of generators and behaviour under the derived pushforward for Azumaya algebras.</description>

      <title>Symmetric nonnegative functions, the tropical Vandermonde cell and superdominance of power sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonnegative and sums of squares symmetric (and even symmetric) functions of fixed degree. We can think of these as limit cones of symmetric nonnegative polynomials and symmetric sums of squares of fixed degree as the number of variables goes to infinity. We compare these cones, including finding explicit examples of nonnegative polynomials which are not sums of squares for any sufficiently large number of variables, and compute the tropicalizations of their dual cones in the even symmetric case. We find that the tropicalization of the dual cones is naturally understood in terms of the overlooked superdominance order on partitions. The power sum symmetric functions obey this same partial order (analogously to how term-normalized power sums obey the dominance order).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a newform of weight $2k$ and let $\chi$ be an unramified imaginary quadratic Hecke character of infinity type $(2t, 0)$, for some integer $0 &lt; t \leq k-1$. We show that the central derivative of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(f,\chi,s)$ is, up to an explicit positive constant, equal to the Beilinson-Bloch height of a generalized Heegner cycle. This generalizes the Gross-Zagier formula (the case $k = 1$) and Zhang's higher weight formula (the case $t=0$).</description>

      <title>Activation thresholds and expressiveness of polynomial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polynomial neural networks have been implemented in a range of applications and present an advantageous framework for theoretical machine learning. A polynomial neural network of fixed architecture and activation degree gives an algebraic map from the network's weights to a set of polynomials. The image of this map is the space of functions representable by the network. Its Zariski closure is an affine variety known as a neurovariety. The dimension of a polynomial neural network's neurovariety provides a measure of its expressivity. In this work, we introduce the notion of the activation threshold of a network architecture which expresses when the dimension of a neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. In addition, we prove expressiveness results for polynomial neural networks with equi-width~architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.08168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a sequence of families of lattice polarized $K3$ surfaces. This sequence is closely related to complex reflection groups of exceptional type. Namely, we obtain modular forms coming from the inverse correspondences of the period mappings attached to our sequence. We study a non-trivial relation between our modular forms and invariants of complex reflection groups. Especially, we consider a family concerned with the Shepherd-Todd group of No.34 based on arithmetic properties of lattices and algebro-geometric properties of the period mappings.</description>

      <title>A dual basis for the equivariant quantum $K$-theory of cominuscule varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equivariant quantum $K$-theory ring of a flag variety is a Frobenius algebra equipped with a perfect pairing called the quantum $K$-metric. It is known that in the classical $K$-theory ring for a given flag variety the ideal sheaf basis is dual to the Schubert basis with regard to the sheaf Euler characteristic. We define a quantization of the ideal sheaf basis for the equivariant quantum $K$-theory of cominuscule flag varieties. These quantized ideal sheaves are then dual to the Schubert basis with regard to the quantum $K$-metric. We prove explicit type-uniform combinatorial formulae for the quantized ideal sheaves in terms of the Schubert basis for any cominuscule flag variety. We also provide an application ultilizing the quantized ideal sheaves to calculate the Schubert structure constants associated to multiplication by the top exterior power of the tautological quotient bundle in $QK_T(Gr(k,n))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact hyperk\"ahler manifold with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi\colon X\to B$. A Shafarevich-Tate twist of $X$ is a holomorphic symplectic manifold with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi^\varphi\colon X^\varphi\to B$ which is isomorphic to $\pi$ locally over the base. In particular, $\pi^\varphi$ has the same fibers as $\pi$. A twist $X^\varphi$ corresponds to an element $\varphi$ in the Shafarevich-Tate group of $X$. We show that $X^\varphi$ is K\"ahler when a multiple of $\varphi$ lies in the connected component of unity of the Shafarevich-Tate group and give a necessary condition for $X^\varphi$ to be bimeromorphic to a K\"ahler manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of cluster $\mathcal{A}$-structures and cluster Poisson structures on any braid variety, for any simple Lie group. The construction is achieved via weave calculus and a tropicalization of Lusztig's coordinates. Several explicit seeds are provided and the quiver and cluster variables are readily computable. We prove that these upper cluster algebras equal their cluster algebras, show local acyclicity, and explicitly determine their DT-transformations as the twist automorphisms of braid varieties. The main result also resolves the conjecture of B. Leclerc on the existence of cluster algebra structures on the coordinate rings of open Richardson varieties.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard Product of Moment Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the (Hadamard) product $s\odot t := (s_\alpha\cdot t_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^n}$ of two sequences $s = (s_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^n}$ and $t = (t_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^n}$. If $s$ is represented by a measure $\mu$ and $t$ by a measure $\nu$, i.e., both are moment sequences, then we give an explicit measure $\mu\odot\nu$ that represents $s\odot t$, i.e., $s\odot t$ is a moment sequence. We pick a result from Moment-sequence transforms (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 24 (2022), 3109--3160) and show how the multiplication $s\odot t$ of moment sequences simplifies the proof and also gives deeper insight by providing the representing measure $\mu\odot\nu$.</description>
