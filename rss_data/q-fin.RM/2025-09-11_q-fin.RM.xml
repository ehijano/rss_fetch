      <title>Chaotic Bayesian Inference: Strange Attractors as Risk Models for Black Swan Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new risk modeling framework where chaotic attractors shape the geometry of Bayesian inference. By combining heavy-tailed priors with Lorenz and Rossler dynamics, the models naturally generate volatility clustering, fat tails, and extreme events. We compare two complementary approaches: Model A, which emphasizes geometric stability, and Model B, which highlights rare bursts using Fibonacci diagnostics. Together, they provide a dual perspective for systemic risk analysis, linking Black Swan theory to practical tools for stress testing and volatility monitoring.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning with Multitype Protected Attributes: Intersectional Fairness through Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however, methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called "fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength, including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims dataset.</description>
