      <title>Employing Vector Field Techniques on the Analysis of Memristor Cellular Nonlinear Networks Cell Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative graphical analysis tool for investigating the dynamics of Memristor Cellular Nonlinear Networks (M-CNNs) featuring 2nd-order processing elements, known as M-CNN cells. In the era of specialized hardware catering to the demands of intelligent autonomous systems, the integration of memristors within Cellular Nonlinear Networks (CNNs) has emerged as a promising paradigm due to their exceptional characteristics. However, the standard Dynamic Route Map (DRM) analysis, applicable to 1st-order systems, fails to address the intricacies of 2nd-order M-CNN cell dynamics, as well the 2nd-order DRM (DRM2) exhibits limitations on the graphical illustration of local dynamical properties of the M-CNN cells, e.g. state derivative's magnitude. To address this limitation, we propose a novel integration of M-CNN cell vector field into the cell's phase portrait, enhancing the analysis efficacy and enabling efficient M-CNN cell design. A comprehensive exploration of M-CNN cell dynamics is presented, showcasing the utility of the proposed graphical tool for various scenarios, including bistable and monostable behavior, and demonstrating its superior ability to reveal subtle variations in cell behavior. Through this work, we offer a refined perspective on the analysis and design of M-CNNs, paving the way for advanced applications in edge computing and specialized hardware.</description>

      <title>DrawTalking: Building Interactive Worlds by Sketching and Speaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05631v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DrawTalking, an approach to building and controlling interactive worlds by sketching and speaking while telling stories. It emphasizes user control and flexibility, and gives programming-like capability without requiring code. An early open-ended study with our prototype shows that the mechanics resonate and are applicable to many creative-exploratory use cases, with the potential to inspire and inform research in future natural interfaces for creative exploration and authoring.</description>

      <title>Wave Interpolation Neural Operator: Interpolated Prediction of Electric Fields Across Untrained Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing photonic structures requires electromagnetic simulations, which often require high computational costs. Researchers have developed surrogate solvers for predicting electric fields to alleviate the computational issues. However, existing surrogate solvers are limited to performing inference at fixed simulation conditions and require retraining for different conditions. To address this, we propose Wave Interpolation Neural Operator (WINO), a novel surrogate solver enabling simulation condition interpolation across a continuous spectrum of broadband wavelengths. WINO introduces the Fourier Group Convolution Shuffling operator and a new conditioning method to efficiently predict electric fields from both trained and untrained wavelength data, achieving significant improvements in parameter efficiency and spectral interpolation performance. Our model demonstrates approximately 100 times faster performance than traditional finite-difference frequency-domain simulations. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art model, we achieve a 74% reduction in parameters and 80.5% improvements in prediction accuracy for untrained wavelengths, and 13.2% improvements for trained wavelengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this research paper is to analyze the available use cases of Narrowband-IoT and IoT in universities, campuses, and educational institutions. A literature review was conducted using multiple databases such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Scopus. The study explores the benefits of IoT adoption in higher education. Various use cases of NB-IoT in educational institutions were analyzed, including smart campus management, asset tracking, monitoring, and safety and security systems. Of the six use cases assessed, three focused on the deployment of IoT Things, while three focused on NB-IoT Connectivity. The research paper concludes that NB-IoT technology has significant potential to enhance various aspects of educational institutions, from smart campus management to improving safety and security systems. The study recommends further exploration and implementation of NB-IoT technology in educational settings to improve efficiency, security, and overall campus management. The research highlights the potential applications of NB-IoT in universities and educational institutions, paving the way for future studies in this area. The social implications of this research could involve enhancing the overall learning experience for students, improving campus safety, and promoting technological advancements in educational settings.

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical computation for automatic guided vehicles scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent efforts to develop quantum computing for practical, industrial-scale challenges, we demonstrate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art hybrid (not necessarily quantum) solvers in addressing the business-centric optimization problem of scheduling Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs). Some solvers can already leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In our study, we utilize D-Wave hybrid solvers that implement classical heuristics with potential assistance from a quantum processing unit. This hybrid methodology performs comparably to existing classical solvers. However, due to the proprietary nature of the software, the precise contribution of quantum computation remains unclear. Our analysis focuses on a practical, business-oriented scenario: scheduling AGVs within a factory constrained by limited space, simulating a realistic production setting. Our approach maps a realistic AGVs problem onto one reminiscent of railway scheduling and demonstrates that the AGVs problem is better suited to quantum computing than its railway counterpart, the latter being denser in terms of the average number of constraints per variable. The main idea here is to highlight the potential usefulness of a hybrid approach for handling AGVs scheduling problems of practical sizes. We show that a scenario involving up to 21 AGVs, significant due to possible deadlocks, can be efficiently addressed by a hybrid solver in seconds.</description>
