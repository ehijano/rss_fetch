      <title>Synthetic Data for Portfolios: A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation methods have always been instrumental in finance, and data-driven methods with minimal model specification, commonly referred to as generative models, have attracted increasing attention, especially after the success of deep learning in a broad range of fields. However, the adoption of these models in financial applications has not kept pace with the growing interest, probably due to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generative models, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin by presenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, and point out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originally available. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development and the desired use case by touching on a paradox: generic generative models inherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (in particular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipeline for the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluation standards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant with stylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls we previously identified. Moreover, we insist on the need for more delicate evaluation methods, and suggest, through an example of mean-reversion strategies, a method designed to identify poor models for a given application based on regurgitative training, i.e. retraining the model using the data it has itself generated, which is commonly referred to in statistics as identifiability.</description>

      <title>Uses of Sub-sample Estimates to Reduce Errors in Stochastic Optimization Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization software enables the solution of problems with millions of variables and associated parameters. These parameters are, however, often uncertain and represented with an analytical description of the parameter's distribution or with some form of sample. With large numbers of such parameters, optimization of the resulting model is often driven by mis-specifications or extreme sample characteristics, resulting in solutions that are far from a true optimum. This paper describes how asymptotic convergence results may not be useful in large-scale problems and how the optimization of problems based on sub-sample estimates may achieve improved results over models using full-sample solution estimates. A motivating example and numerical results from a portfolio optimization problem demonstrate the potential improvement. A theoretical analysis also provides insight into the structure of problems where sub-sample optimization may be most beneficial.</description>
