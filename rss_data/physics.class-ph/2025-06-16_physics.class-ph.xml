      <title>Numerical approach to second-order canonical perturbation theory in the planetary 3-body problem. Application to exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extrasolar planetary systems commonly exhibit planets on eccentric orbits, with many systems located near or within mean-motion resonances, showcasing a wide diversity of orbital architectures. Such complex systems challenge traditional secular theories, which are limited to first-order approximations in planetary masses or rely on expansions in orbital elements--eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major axis ratios--that are subject to convergence issues, especially in highly eccentric, inclined, or tightly-packed systems. To overcome these limitations, we develop a numerical approach to second-order perturbation theory based on the Lie transform formalism. Our method avoids the need for expansions in orbital elements, ensuring broader applicability and more robust convergence. We first outline the Hamiltonian framework for the 3-body planetary problem, and apply a canonical transformation to eliminate fast angle dependencies, deriving the secular Hamiltonian up to second order in the mass ratio. We then use the fast Fourier transform algorithm to numerically simulate, in an accurate way, the long-term evolution of planetary systems near or away from mean-motion resonances. Finally, we validate our methods against well-known planetary configurations, such as the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system, as well as to exoplanetary systems like WASP-148, TIC 279401253 and GJ 876, demonstrating the applicability of our models across a wide range of planetary configurations.</description>

      <title>Generalized solution of the paraxial equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fairly general expression for a light beam is found as a solution of the paraxial Helmholtz equation. It is achieved by exploiting appropriately chosen complex variables which entail the separability of the equation. Next, the expression for the beam is obtained independently by superimposing shifted Gaussian beams, whereby the shift can be made either by a real vector (in which case the foci of the Gaussian beams are located on a circle) or by a complex one. The solutions found depend on several parameters, the specific choice of which allows to obtain beams with quite different properties. For several selected parameter values figures are drawn, demonstrating the spatial distribution of the energy density and phase. In special cases, the effect of a shift of the intensity peak from one branch to another and phase singularities are observed.</description>
