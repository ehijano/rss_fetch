      <title>On the Local Structure and Approximation Stability of Block Isotropic Gaussian Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skew-symmetric functions are a class of functions defined on a product space $M \times M$ that are antisymmetric with respect to the order of their inputs. In [13], the authors proved that non-deterministic skew-symmetric Gaussian fields cannot be stationary or isotropic and proposed an alternative notion: stationarity (isotropy) in each component space. Our work focuses on local quadratic approximations of the associated Gaussian fields. Local quadratic approximations to random fields are random polynomials parametrized by a jointly sampled gradient vector and Hessian matrix. We characterize the distribution of the corresponding random vectors and random matrices. Then, we study the error in the quadratic approximation, which is also a Gaussian field. We investigate the error induced by the quadratic approximation in three senses: the pointwise error, the maximal error over an ellipsoidal region, and the worst-case error for multivariate Gaussian inputs at a given confidence level. Next, we explore the limiting behavior of the worst-case error as the distance between an expansion point and evaluation points approaches zero and infinity. Finally, we study how, as the input dimension increases, the variance of multivariate Gaussian distributions must be restricted to keep the worst-case error bound constant.</description>

      <title>Wick integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Wick integral $\int_s^t p(X_u) \Diamond \mathrm{d} X_u$ for a class of stochastic processes $X$ which are not necessarily Gaussian, in the regime of bounded $2&gt; q$-variation. The integral is defined for polynomial integrands, and has the property of being centred if $X$ is such. In the case of $1/2 &lt; H$-fractional Brownian motion, the Wick integral agrees with the divergence operator in Malliavin calculus. It satisfies a correction formula with the Young integral $\int p(X)\mathrm{d} X$ and an It\^o formula which have arbitrarily many correction terms (only limited by the degree of $p$), given by integration against the cumulant functions of $X$, and reduce to familiar identities in the Gaussian case. These results are obtained by first developing diagram formulae for Appell polynomials. Our theory applies to a range of processes taking values in bounded Wiener chaos, such as the Rosenblatt process.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Dirichlet approximation for the stationary distribution of the inclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the approximation of the stationary distribution of the finite inclusion process with the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. Using Stein's method, we derive an explicit bound for the approximation error, which is of order 1/N in the thermodynamic limit. The results are achieved from a minor modification to Stein's method for Poisson-Dirichlet distribution approximation developed in Gan &amp; Ross (2021). The derivatives used on test functions in Gan &amp; Ross (2021) were directional type derivatives specifically chosen for their measure preserving properties. Depending upon the application, these derivatives can prove cumbersome. In this note, we show that for certain test functions we can instead use more traditional derivatives, which simplifies the bounds for the Stein factors and is more amenable to the approximation of the inclusion process.</description>

      <title>Sharp Mixing Rates for Markov Chains on General Spaces with Unbounded Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Markov chains on general state spaces in stationary random environment which are defined by a random mapping that is contractive up to a bounded perturbation. We prove their convergence to a limiting law, providing convergence rates. We also show that these processes are strongly mixing and estimate their mixing coefficients. Our results significantly extend those available in the literature. In particular, for some additive autoregressive processes with exogenous covariates we achieve mixing rates that are optimal up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>The maximal correlation coefficient associated with the minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For independent random variables $(X_i)_{1\leq i\leq n}$, we consider the maximal correlation coefficient $R=R(\min_{i:1\leq i\leq m}X_i,\min_{j:\ell+1\leq j\leq n}X_j)$. If $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ are identically distributed with the same continuous distribution, we find that $R=(m-\ell)/\sqrt{m(n-\ell)}$. For discrete distributions, we calculate the maximal correlation coefficient $R$ for Bernoulli distributions, geometric distributions, binomial distributions and Poisson distributions. Our paper answers a question in \cite[Section~6]{ChangChen}.</description>

      <title>Points of slow growth for parabolic SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the stochastic PDE, $\partial_tu = \partial^2_x u + \sigma(u) \dot{W}$ on $\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}$, subject to $u(0)\equiv1$, where $\dot{W}$ denotes space-time white noise on $\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is Lipschitz continuous. It is known that $u(t\,,x)-1$ has approximately a Gaussian distribution for every $x$ when $t\approx0$. Here we prove that there exist random points $x\in\mathbb{R}$ where the fluctuations of the solution near times zero are almost surely of sharp order $t^{1/4}$. Our work bears some loose resemblance to the study of the slow points of Brownian motion increments, though significant challenges arise due to the infinite-dimensional nature of the present problem.</description>

      <title>Continuous data assimilation for 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous data assimilation methods, such as the nudging algorithm introduced by Azouani, Olson, and Titi (AOT) [2], are known to be highly effective in deterministic settings for asymptotically synchronizing approximate solutions with observed dynamics. In this work, we extend this framework to a stochastic regime by considering the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to either additive or multiplicative noise. We establish sufficient conditions on the nudging parameter and the spatial observation scale that guarantee convergence of the nudged solution to the true stochastic flow.
  In the case of multiplicative noise, convergence holds in expectation, with exponential or polynomial rates depending on the growth of the noise covariance. For additive noise, we obtain the exponential convergence both in expectation and pathwise. These results yield a stochastic generalization of the AOT theory, demonstrating how the interplay between random forcing, viscous dissipation and feedback control governs synchronization in stochastic fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Ancestral diversity in fragmentation trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a deterministic or random tree, a notion of ancestral diversity can be defined as follows. Sample independently $n$ groups of $k$ leaves and count the number $N_n(k)$ of distinct most recent common ancestors of each of the groups. As $n$ becomes large, the asymptotic behavior of $N_n(k)$ depends of course on the structure of the tree. Motivated by the study of the edge density in the Brownian co-graphon, Chapuy recently considered this problem in the case where $k=2$ and where the tree is the Brownian continuum random tree. We vastly extend this framework by considering general values of $k$ and general fragmentation trees, which include some prominent examples such as stable L\'evy trees and idealized models of phylogenetic trees. Other natural ancestral statistics are also considered. For a given tree model, we identify a phase transition-like phenomenon, with different asymptotic regimes for $N_k(n)$, depending on the position of $k$ relative to a model-dependent critical value.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the complex mobility matrix for the random conductance model on $\mathbb{T}^d_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a continuous-time random walk on the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d_{N}=\mathbb{Z}^d/N \mathbb{Z}^d$, possibly with long-range, but finite, jumps. The law of the jumps is regulated by a random environment $\xi$ yielding a stationary and ergodic field of random conductances. The complex mobility matrix $\sigma_N^\xi(\omega)$ measures the linear response of the random walk to a $\cos(\omega t)$-type oscillating external field. By investigating the homogenization properties of the medium, and assuming in addition that the conductances have finite second moment, we show that, for almost every realization of the environment $\xi$, the complex mobility matrix $\sigma_N^\xi(\omega)$ converges as $N\to+\infty$ to a deterministic limiting matrix $\sigma(\omega)$ and provide different characterizations of $\sigma(\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Some vector-valued examples of noncentral moderate deviation results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term noncentral moderate deviations is used in the literature to mean a class of large
  deviation principles that, in some sense, fills the gap between the convergence in probability to a
  constant (governed by a reference large deviation principle) and a weak convergence to a non-Gaussian
  (and non-degenerating) distribution. Several examples can be found in the literature, mainly for
  real-valued random variables (see, e.g.,~\cite{GiulianoMacci} and the references cited therein). In this
  paper we present some examples with vector-valued random variables.</description>

      <title>The Poisson stick model in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Poisson stick model in two dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^2,$ where the sticks all have length $L.$ Typically, percolation models in hyperbolic space undergo two phase transitions as the intensity $\lambda$ varies, namely the percolation phase transition and the uniqueness phase transition. For the Poisson stick model, the critical intensities at which these transitions occur will depend on $L$, and in this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of these critical points as $L\to \infty.$ Our main results show that the critical point for the percolation phase transition scales like $L^{-2},$ while the critical point for the uniqueness phase transition scales like $L^{-1}.$ Comparing these results to the analogous results in Euclidean space show that the behavior of the percolation phase transition is the same in these two settings, while the uniqueness phase transition scales differently.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium coagulation processes and subcritical percolation on evolving networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate percolation on growing networks where the evolution of connected components resembles a non-equilibrium version of the multiplicative coalescent. The supercritical $\pi&gt; \pi_c$ regime for a host of such models was conjectured in statistical physics, and then rigorously proven in mathematics, to exhibit behavior similar to the BKT infinite-order phase transition as $\pi\searrow \pi_c$. It has further been conjectured that the entire regime $\pi&lt;\pi_c$ for such growing networks are ''critical'' with power-law cluster size distributions having a non-universal exponent for all values of $\pi \in (0, \pi_c)$.
  In this paper, we study percolation on the uniform attachment model, as a concrete template in order to develop general tools based on stochastic approximation, local convergence, branching random walks and tree-graph inequalities to prove the above conjectured phenomena. For each $\pi \in (0,\pi_c)$, we show there exists an explicit $\alpha(\pi) \in (0,\tfrac{1}{2}) $ such that the maximal component size, as well as the size of the component containing any fixed vertex, all re-scaled by $n^{\alpha(\pi)}$, converge almost surely to strictly positive random variables as the network size $n \to \infty$. These dynamics lead to novel phenomena, compared to classical 'static' models, including long-range dependence and fixation of the identity of the maximal component, within finite time, among a finite number of 'early' components. Moreover, in contrast with most static network models, we show that the susceptibility, that is, the expected size of the component of a uniformly chosen vertex, remains bounded as the network grows and $\pi$ approaches $\pi_c$ from below. The general tools developed in this paper will be used in follow-up work to understand percolation for general growing network evolution models.</description>

      <title>Percolation on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Percolation is a model for random damage to a network. It is one of the simplest models that displays a phase transition: when the network is severely damaged, it falls apart in many small connected components, while if the damage is light, connectivity is hardly affected. We study the location and nature of the phase transition on random graphs. In particular, we focus on the connectivity structure close to, or below, criticality, where components display intricate scaling behaviour such that a typical connected component has bounded size, while the average and maximal connected component sizes grow like powers of the network size.
  We review the recent progress that has been made in two important settings: random graphs whose expected adjacency matrix is close to being rank-1, the most prominent examples being the configuration model and rank-1 inhomogeneous random graphs, and dynamic random graphs, i.e., random graphs that grow with time, such as uniform and preferential attachment models. Remarkably, these two settings behave rather differently. In all cases, the inhomogeneity of the underlying random graph on which we perform percolation is of crucial importance.</description>

      <title>Explicit Solution to a government debt reduction problem: a stochastic control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of optimal reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio in a stochastic control setting. The debt-to-GDP dynamics are modeled through a stochastic differential equation in which fiscal policy simultaneously affects both debt accumulation and GDP growth. A key feature of the framework is the introduction of a cost functional that captures the disutility of fiscal surpluses and the perceived benefit of fiscal deficits, thus incorporating the macroeconomic trade-off between tighten and expansionary policies. By applying the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman approach, we provide explicit solutions in the case of linear GDP response to the fiscal policies. We rigorously analyze threshold-type fiscal strategies in the case of linear impact of the fiscal policy and provide closed-form solutions for the associated value function in relevant regimes. A sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying key model parameters, confirming the robustness of our theoretical findings. The application to debt reduction highlights how fiscal costs and benefits influence optimal interventions, offering valuable insights into sustainable public debt management under uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the Euler-Maruyama dicretization of the formal SDE, $dX_t=b(t,X_t)dt+dZ_t$, where $Z$ is a symmetric isotropic d dimensional stable process of index $\alpha\in (1,2)$, and $b$ is distributional. It belongs to a mix Lebesgue-Besov space. The associated parameters satisfy some constraints which guarantee weak-well posedness. Defining an appropriate Euler scheme, we obtain a convergence rate for the weak error on the densities. The rate depends on the parameters.</description>

      <title>Uniform spectral gaps, non-abelian Littlewood-Offord and anti-concentration for random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that random walks on semisimple algebraic groups do not concentrate on proper algebraic subvarieties with uniform exponential rate of anti-concentration. This is achieved by proving a uniform spectral gap for quasi-regular representations of countable linear groups. The method makes key use of Diophantine heights and the Height Gap theorem. We also deduce a non-abelian version of the Littlewood--Offord inequalities and prove logarithmic bounds for escape from subvarieties. In a sequel to this paper, we will show how to transform this uniform gap into uniform expansion for Cayley graphs of finite simple groups of bounded rank $G(p)$ over almost all primes $p$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics with self-exciting factor for Monkeypox transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic human-rodent compartment model for Mpox transmission that combines diffusion noise with Hawkes self-exciting jumps in the human infection dynamics. Including Hawkes processes allows, for instance, to model the short but significant spikes in transmission happening after crowded events. For the coupled human-rodent system, we prove global existence, uniqueness and positivity of solutions, derive a basic reproduction number R_0 that guarantees almost sure extinction when R_0 &lt; 1, and obtain explicit persistence-in-the-mean conditions for both infected rodents and humans, which define persistence thresholds for the joint dynamics. Numerical experiments show how clustered human transmission events, environmental variability and control measures shift these thresholds and shape the frequency and size of Mpox outbreaks.</description>

      <title>The Universal Property of Measure-Theoretic Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on work of Chen, we give a universal property of the Markov category BorelStoch of standard Borel spaces and Markov kernels between them. To do this, we introduce a new notion of *coinflip*, or unbiased binary choice, in a Markov category. These are unique if they exist, and automatically preserved by all Markov functors which preserve coproducts. We also provide universal characterizations of various Markov categories of discrete kernels.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic sensitivity of cumulant growth in lacunary sums: transcendental versus algebraic ratio limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums $S_n(\omega) := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 \pi a_k \omega)$, $\omega\in[0,1]$, and show that cumulant growth is highly sensitive to the arithmetic structure of the sequence $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ of positive integers. In particular, if $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k = \eta &gt; 1$ for some transcendental number $\eta$, we prove that for every $m\in \mathbb N$ the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ is asymptotically equivalent to the $m$-th cumulant of the ``independent model'' $\widetilde{S}_n := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 \pi a_k U_k)$, where $U_1, U_2, \dots$ are independent random variables having uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. In particular, the order of growth of the cumulants as $n \to \infty$ is linear in this case. We also show that the transcendence condition for $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k$ is in general necessary: when the ratio limit $\eta$ is algebraic, the cumulants of $S_n$ may have a different asymptotic order from those of $\widetilde{S}_n$. For instance, for $a_k = 2^k+1$ (with $\eta = 2$), the sixth cumulant of $S_n$ grows quadratically in $n$. In contrast, for $a_k = 2^k$ (again $\eta = 2$) or when $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ is the Fibonacci sequence (with $\eta = (1+\sqrt 5)/2$), the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ grows linearly as $n\to\infty$, but with a growth rate that differs from the one of the independent model $\widetilde{S}_n$. Overall, our results show that the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums depends on arithmetic effects in a very delicate way. This is particularly remarkable since many other probabilistic limit theorems, such as the Central Limit Theorem, hold for lacunary trigonometric sums in a universal way without any such sensitivity towards arithmetic effects.</description>

Abstract: We present explicit formulae for parameterized families of probabilities of the number of nonoverlapping words and increasing nonoverlapping words in independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) finite valued random variables, respectively. Then we provide an explicit formula for a parameterized family of probabilities of the number of runs, which
  generalizes \(\mu\)-overlapping probabilities for \(\mu\geq 0\) in i.i.d.~binary valued random variables. We also demonstrate exact probabilities of the number of runs whose size are exactly given numbers (Mood 1940). The number of arithmetic operations required to compute our formula for generalized probabilities of runs is linear order of sample size for fixed number of parameters and range. To analyse these number of arithmetic operations for unbounded number of parameters, we show an asymptotic formula for the number of integer partitions that are less than or equal to given number as a special case of Meinardus's theorem.</description>

      <title>Scaling Methods for Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic properties of some Markov processes associated to stochastic chemical reaction networks (CRNs) driven by the kinetics of the law of mass action are analyzed. The scaling regime introduced in the paper assumes that the norm of the initial state is converging to infinity. The reaction rate constants are kept fixed. The purpose of the paper is of showing, with simple examples, a scaling analysis in this context. The main difference with the scalings of the literature is that it does not change the graph structure of the CRN or its reaction rates. Several CRNs are investigated to illustrate the insight that can be gained on the qualitative properties of these networks. A detailed scaling analysis of a CRN with several interesting asymptotic properties, with a bi-modal behavior in particular, is worked out in the last section. Additionally, with several examples, we also show that a stability criterion due to Filonov for positive recurrence of Markov processes may simplify significantly the stability analysis of these networks.</description>

      <title>On the monotonicity of discrete entropy for log-concave random vectors on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following type of discrete entropy monotonicity for sums of isotropic, log-concave, independent and identically distributed random vectors $X_1,\dots,X_{n+1}$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$: $$ H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n+1}) \geq H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n}) + \frac{d}{2}\log{\Bigl(\frac{n+1}{n}\Bigr)} +o(1), $$ where $o(1)$ vanishes as $H(X_1) \to \infty$. Moreover, for the $o(1)$-term, we obtain a rate of convergence $ O\Bigl({H(X_1)}{e^{-\frac{1}{d}H(X_1)}}\Bigr)$, where the implied constants depend on $d$ and $n$. This generalizes to $\mathbb{Z}^d$ the one-dimensional result of the second named author (2023). As in dimension one, our strategy is to establish that the discrete entropy $H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n})$ is close to the differential (continuous) entropy $h(X_1+U_1+\cdots+X_{n}+U_{n})$, where $U_1,\dots, U_n$ are independent and identically distributed uniform random vectors on $[0,1]^d$ and to apply the theorem of Artstein, Ball, Barthe and Naor (2004) on the monotonicity of differential entropy. In fact, we show this result under more general assumptions than log-concavity, which are preserved up to constants under convolution. In order to show that log-concave distributions satisfy our assumptions in dimension $d\ge2$, more involved tools from convex geometry are needed because a suitable position is required. We show that, for a log-concave function on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in isotropic position, its integral, barycenter and covariance matrix are close to their discrete counterparts. Moreover, in the log-concave case, we weaken the isotropicity assumption to what we call almost isotropicity. One of our technical tools is a discrete analogue to the upper bound on the isotropic constant of a log-concave function, which extends to dimensions $d\ge1$ a result of Bobkov, Marsiglietti and Melbourne (2022).</description>

      <title>Monotonicity, Topology, and Convexity of Recurrence in Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04108v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider non-homogeneous random walks on the two-dimensional positive quadrant $\mathbb{N}^2$ and the one-dimensional slab $\{0,1,\dots,k\}\times\mathbb{N}$. In the 1960's the following question was asked for $\mathbb{N}^2$: is it true if such a random walk $X$ is recurrent and $Y$ is another random walk that at every point is more likely to go down and more likely to go left than $Y$, then $Y$ is also recurrent?
  We provide an example showing that the answer is negative. We also show, via a coupling argument, that if either the random walk $X$ or $Y$ is sufficiently homogeneous then the answer is in fact positive. In addition, we show using the Rayleigh monotonicity principle that the analogous question for random walks on trees is positive.
  These results show that the subset of parameter space that yields recurrent random walks possesses some geometric properties, in this case the structure of an order ideal. Motivated by this perspective, we consider the more symmetric setting of homogeneous random walks on finitely generated abelian groups, and ask when this subset possesses other geometric properties, namely various topological properties and convexity. We answer some of these questions: in particular, we show that this subset is closed, and under a symmetric support condition, show it is path-connected and additionally show it is convex if and only if its effective dimension is at most 2. We also show its complement is in some sense typically path-connected but not convex. We finally propose some related open problems.</description>

      <title>Generalized percolation games on the $2$-dimensional square lattice, and ergodicity of associated probabilistic cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Each vertex of the infinite $2$-dimensional square lattice graph is assigned, independently, a label that reads trap with probability $p$, target with probability $q$, and open with probability $(1-p-q)$, and each edge is assigned, independently, a label that reads trap with probability $r$ and open with probability $(1-r)$. A percolation game is played on this random board, wherein two players take turns to make moves, where a move involves relocating the token from where it is currently located, say $(x,y) \in \mathbb{Z}^{2}$, to one of $(x+1,y)$ and $(x,y+1)$. A player wins if she is able to move the token to a vertex labeled a target, or force her opponent to either move the token to a vertex labeled a trap or along an edge labeled a trap. We seek to find a regime, in terms of $p$, $q$ and $r$, in which the probability of this game resulting in a draw equals $0$. We consider special cases of this game, such as when each edge is assigned, independently, a label that reads trap with probability $r$, target with probability $s$, and open with probability $(1-r-s)$, but the vertices are left unlabeled. Various regimes of values of $r$ and $s$ are explored in which the probability of draw is guaranteed to be $0$. We show that the probability of draw in each such game equals $0$ if and only if a certain probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) is ergodic, following which we implement the technique of weight functions to investigate the regimes in which said PCA is ergodic.</description>

      <title>Periodic Pitman transforms and jointly invariant measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct explicit jointly invariant measures for the periodic KPZ equation (and therefore also the stochastic Burgers' and stochastic heat equations) for general slope parameters and prove their uniqueness via a one force--one solution principle. The measures are given by polymer-like transforms of independent Brownian bridges. We describe several properties and limits of these measures, including an extension to a continuous process in the slope parameter that we term the periodic KPZ horizon. As an application of our construction, we prove a Gaussian process limit theorem with an explicit covariance function for the long-time height function fluctuations of the periodic KPZ equation when started from varying slopes. In connection with this, we conjecture a formula for the fluctuations of cumulants of the endpoint distribution for the periodic continuum directed random polymer.
  To prove joint invariance, we address the analogous problem for a semi-discrete system of SDEs related to the periodic O'Connell-Yor polymer model and then perform a scaling limit of the model and jointly invariant measures. For the semi-discrete system, we demonstrate a bijection that maps our systems of SDEs to another system with product invariant measure. Inverting the map on this product measure yields our invariant measures. This map relates to a periodic version of the discrete geometric Pitman transform that we introduce and probe. As a by-product of this, we show that the jointly invariant measures for a periodic version of the inverse-gamma polymer are the same as those for the O'Connell-Yor polymer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a single server queue in heavy traffic, with general inter-arrival and service time distributions, where arrival and service rates vary discontinuously as a function of the (diffusively scaled) queue length. It is proved that the weak limit is given by the unique-in-law solution to a stochastic differential equation in $[0,\infty)$ with discontinuous drift and diffusion coefficients. The main tool is a semimartingale decomposition for point processes introduced in \cite{dal-miy}, which is distinct from the Doob-Meyer decomposition of a counting process. Whereas the use of this tool is demonstrated here for a particular model, we believe it may be useful for investigating the scaling limits of queueing models very broadly.</description>

Abstract: We study a time-inhomogeneous nonlinear SDE with drift and diffusion governed by state-dependent variable exponents. This framework generalizes models like the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the constant elasticity of variance (CEV), offering flexibility to capture complex dynamics while posing analytical challenges. Using a fixed-point approach, we prove existence and uniqueness, analyze higher-order moments, derive asymptotic estimates, and assess stability. Finally, we illustrate an application where the Poisson equation admits a probabilistic representation via a time-homogeneous nonlinear SDE with state-dependent variable exponents.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a carr\'e du champ operator for Banach-valued random elements, taking values in the projective tensor product, and use it to control the bounded Lipschitz distance between a Malliavin-smooth random element satisfying mild regularity assumptions and a Radon Gaussian taking values in the Skorokhod space equipped with the uniform topology. In the case where the random element is a Banach-valued multiple integral, the carr\'e du champ expression is further bounded by norms of the contracted integral kernel. The main technical tool is an integration by parts formula, which might be of independent interest. As a by-product, we recover a bound obtained recently by D\"uker and Zoubouloglou in the Hilbert space setting and complement it by providing contraction bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the Quantitative Central Limit Theorem (QCLT) for the spatial average of the solution of the nonlinear stochastic heat equation with constant initial condition, driven by space-time Gaussian white noise in dimension 1. The novelty is that the equation contains a drift term. We assume that the drift and diffusion coefficients are twice differentiable with bounded first and second order derivatives. For the proof, we use Malliavin calculus, and the second-order Poincar\'e inequality due to Vidotto (2020). To estimate the moment of the second Malliavin derivative of the solution, we develop a novel estimate for the product of two heat kernels, which is of independent interest. Finally, we provide the functional result corresponding to this CLT.</description>

      <title>Conditioned stochastic stability of equilibrium states on uniformly expanding repellers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a notion of conditioned stochastic stability of invariant measures on repellers: we consider whether quasi-ergodic measures of absorbing Markov processes, generated by random perturbations of the deterministic dynamics and conditioned upon survival in a neighbourhood of a repeller, converge to an invariant measure in the zero-noise limit. Under suitable choices of the random perturbation, we find that equilibrium states on uniformly expanding repellers are conditioned stochastically stable. In the process, we establish a rigorous foundation for the existence of ``natural measures'', which were proposed by Kantz and Grassberger in 1984 to aid the understanding of chaotic transients.</description>

      <title>Sufficient condition for dispersal-induced growth on dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a population spreading across a finite number of sites. Individuals can move from one site to the other according to a network (oriented links between the sites) that vary periodically over time. On each site, the population experiences a growth rate which is also periodically time varying. Recently, this kind of models have been extensively studied, using various technical tools to derive precise necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system (ie the local growth rate on each site, the time period and the strength of migration between the sites) for the population to grow. In the present paper, we take a completely different approach: using elementary comparison results between linear systems, we give sufficient condition for the growth of the population This condition is easy to check and can be applied in a broad class of examples. In particular, in the case when all sites are sinks (ie, in the absence of migration, the population become extinct in each site), we prove that when our condition of growth if satisfied, the population grows when the time period is large and for values of the migration strength that are exponentially small with respect to the time period, which answers positively to a conjecture stated by Katriel.</description>

      <title>Discrete stochastic maximal regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete regularity estimates for a broad class of temporal numerical schemes for parabolic stochastic evolution equations. We provide a characterization of discrete stochastic maximal $\ell^p$-regularity in terms of its continuous counterpart, thereby establishing a unified framework that yields numerous new discrete regularity results. Moreover, as a consequence of the continuous-time theory, we establish several important properties of discrete stochastic maximal regularity such as extrapolation in the exponent $p$ and with respect to a power weight. Furthermore, employing the $H^\infty$-functional calculus, we derive a powerful discrete maximal estimate in the trace space norm $D_A(1-\frac1p,p)$ for $p \in [2,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>On Rapid mixing for random walks on nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rapid mixing for almost all random walks generated by $m$ translations on an arbitrary nilmanifold under mild assumptions on the size of $m$. For several classical classes of nilmanifolds, we show $m=2$ suffices. This provides a partial answer to the question raised in \cite{D02} about the prevalence of rapid mixing for random walks on homogeneous spaces.</description>
