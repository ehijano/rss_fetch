      <title>Conjugacy and Least Commutative Congruences in Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a semigroup $S$ and $s,t \in S$, write $s \sim_p^1 t$ if $s=pr$ and $t=rp$, for some $p,r \in S \cup \{1\}$. This relation, known as "primary conjugacy", along with its transitive closure $\sim_p$, has been extensively used and studied in many fields of algebra. This paper is devoted to a natural generalization, defined by $s \sim_s^1 t$ whenever $s=p_1\cdots p_{n}$ and $t=p_{f(1)}\cdots p_{f(n)}$, for some $p_1, \dots, p_n \in S \cup \{1\}$ and permutation $f$ of $\{1, \dots, n\}$, together with its transitive closure $\sim_s$. The relation $\sim_s$ is the congruence generated by either $\sim_p^1$ or $\sim_p$, and is moreover the least commutative congruence on any semigroup. We explore general properties of $\sim_s$, discuss it in the context of groups and rings, compare it to other semigroup conjugacy relations, and fully describe its equivalence classes in free, Rees matrix, graph inverse, and various transformation semigroups.</description>

      <title>Steadied Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras and local models for blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It's known that many different blocks of $\mathbb{F}_pS_n$ for different values of $n$ are equivalent as categories, though the corresponding block algebras are almost never isomorphic. Thus, it is a challenging problem to give one particularly nice representative of this Morita equivalence class of algebras. This has been accomplished for the case of RoCK blocks through work of Chuang--Kessar, Turner, and Evseev--Kleshchev. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this problem, applying not just to RoCK blocks of $S_n$, but also to all blocks of Ariki--Koike algebras. We do this by considering steadied quotients of KLRW algebras: these algebras are a natural generalization of cyclotomic quotients, already related to $S_n$ and Ariki--Koike algebras in work of Brundan--Kleshchev. These algebras are defined by ``tilting'' the cyclotomic relations so that we kill the two-sided ideal defined by certain configurations on the left and right sides of our diagrams. We show a Morita equivalence between these algebras and blocks of Ariki-Koike algebras generalizing the work discussed above.</description>

      <title>Ring theory in o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general ring theory in the o-minimal setting culminating in a description of all the definable rings in an arbitrary o-minimal structure. We show that every definably connected ring with non-trivial multiplication defines an infinite field and it is essentially semialgebraic. A surprisingly strong correspondence between definably connected rings and finite-dimensional associative $\mathbb{R}$-algebras is established. Every ideal of a definable unital ring is definable, from which it follows that every definable unital ring is Artinian and Noetherian. If a definable ring $R$ is not unital, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $R$ to embed in a definable unital ring as an ideal. Moreover, when this is the case, we provide the smallest such definable unital ring $R^{\wedge}$, its definable unitazation.</description>

      <title>Co-Kasch Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the modules $M$ every simple subfactors of which is a homomorphic image of $M$ and call them co-Kasch modules. These modules are dual to Kasch modules $M$ every simple subfactors of which can be embedded in $M$. We show that a module is co-Kasch if and only if every simple module in $\sigma[M]$ is a homomorphic image of $M$. In particular, a projective right module $P$ is co-Kasch if and only if $P$ is a generator for $\sigma[P]$. If $R$ is right max and right $H$-ring, then every right $R$-module is co-Kasch; and the converse is true for the rings whose simple right modules have locally artinian injective hulls. For a right artinian ring $R$, we prove that: (1) every finitely generated right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and only if every right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module if and only if $R$ is a right $H$-ring; and (2) every finitely generated projective right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and only if the Cartan matrix of $R$ is a diagonal matrix. For a Pr\"ufer domain $R$, we prove that, every nonzero ideal of $R$ is co-Kasch if and only if $R$ is Dedekind. The structure of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules that are co-Kasch is completely characterized.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional module factorizations and complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce higher-dimensional module factorizations associated to a regular sequence. They include higher-dimensional matrix factorizations, which are commutative cubes consisting of free modules with edges being classical matrix factorizations. We characterize the stable category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over a complete intersection via higher-dimensional matrix factorizations over the corresponding regular local ring. The result generalizes to noncommutative rings, including quantum complete intersections.</description>
