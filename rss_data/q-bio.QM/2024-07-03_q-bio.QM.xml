      <title>FAFE: Immune Complex Modeling with Geodesic Distance Loss on Noisy Group Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the striking success of general protein folding models such as AlphaFold2(AF2, Jumper et al. (2021)), the accurate computational modeling of antibody-antigen complexes remains a challenging task. In this paper, we first analyze AF2's primary loss function, known as the Frame Aligned Point Error (FAPE), and raise a previously overlooked issue that FAPE tends to face gradient vanishing problem on high-rotational-error targets. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a novel geodesic loss called Frame Aligned Frame Error (FAFE, denoted as F2E to distinguish from FAPE), which enables the model to better optimize both the rotational and translational errors between two frames. We then prove that F2E can be reformulated as a group-aware geodesic loss, which translates the optimization of the residue-to-residue error to optimizing group-to-group geodesic frame distance. By fine-tuning AF2 with our proposed new loss function, we attain a correct rate of 52.3\% (DockQ $&gt;$ 0.23) on an evaluation set and 43.8\% correct rate on a subset with low homology, with substantial improvement over AF2 by 182\% and 100\% respectively.</description>

      <title>Message-Relevant Dimension Reduction of Neural Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying relevant interactions between neural populations is a prominent question in the analysis of high-dimensional neural recordings. However, existing dimension reduction methods often discuss communication in the absence of a formal framework, while frameworks proposed to address this gap are impractical in data analysis. This work bridges the formal framework of M-Information Flow with practical analysis of real neural data. To this end, we propose Iterative Regression, a message-dependent linear dimension reduction technique that iteratively finds an orthonormal basis such that each basis vector maximizes correlation between the projected data and the message. We then define 'M-forwarding' to formally capture the notion of a message being forwarded from one neural population to another. We apply our methodology to recordings we collected from two neural populations in a simplified model of whisker-based sensory detection in mice, and show that the low-dimensional M-forwarding structure we infer supports biological evidence of a similar structure between the two original, high-dimensional populations.</description>

      <title>VDAC Solvation Free Energy Calculation by a Nonuniform Size Modified Poisson-Boltzmann Ion Channel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) protein is the primary conduit for the regulated passage of ions and metabolites into and out of mitochondria. Calculating its solvation free energy is crucial for understanding its stability, function, and interactions within the cellular environment. In this paper, we introduce a total solvation free energy, $E$, which is the sum of electrostatic, ideal gas, and excess free energies, along with a non-polar energy to yield a zero of $E$ in the absence of charges. We develop numerical schemes for computing $E$ and update the current mesh generation package to accelerate the generation of tetrahedral meshes and improve the quality of meshes for computing $E$. By integrating these schemes and the updated mesh package with our non-uniform size modified Poisson-Boltzmann ion channel (nuSMPBIC), SMPBIC, and PBIC finite element packages, the PDB2PQR package, and the OPM database, we create the VDAC Solvation Free Energy Calculation (VSFEC) package. Using the VSFEC package, we perform comparison tests on the nuSMPBIC, SMPBIC, and PBIC models by using six VDAC proteins and various ionic solutions containing up to four ionic species, including ATP$^{4-}$ and Ca$^{2+}$. We also conduct tests with different neutral voltages and permittivity constants to explore the varying patterns of $E$. Our test results underscore the importance of considering non-uniform ionic size effects and demonstrate the high performance of the VSFEC package in calculating the solvation free energy of VDAC proteins.</description>

      <title>Deciphering interventional dynamical causality from non-intervention systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and quantifying causality is a focal topic in the fields of science, engineering, and interdisciplinary studies. However, causal studies on non-intervention systems attract much attention but remain extremely challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a framework named Interventional Dynamical Causality (IntDC) for such non-intervention systems, along with its computational criterion, Interventional Embedding Entropy (IEE), to quantify causality. The IEE criterion theoretically and numerically enables the deciphering of IntDC solely from observational (non-interventional) time-series data, without requiring any knowledge of dynamical models or real interventions in the considered system. Demonstrations of performance showed the accuracy and robustness of IEE on benchmark simulated systems as well as real-world systems, including the neural connectomes of C. elegans, COVID-19 transmission networks in Japan, and regulatory networks surrounding key circadian genes.</description>

      <title>Aligning Target-Aware Molecule Diffusion Models with Exact Energy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating ligand molecules for specific protein targets, known as structure-based drug design, is a fundamental problem in therapeutics development and biological discovery. Recently, target-aware generative models, especially diffusion models, have shown great promise in modeling protein-ligand interactions and generating candidate drugs. However, existing models primarily focus on learning the chemical distribution of all drug candidates, which lacks effective steerability on the chemical quality of model generations. In this paper, we propose a novel and general alignment framework to align pretrained target diffusion models with preferred functional properties, named AliDiff. AliDiff shifts the target-conditioned chemical distribution towards regions with higher binding affinity and structural rationality, specified by user-defined reward functions, via the preference optimization approach. To avoid the overfitting problem in common preference optimization objectives, we further develop an improved Exact Energy Preference Optimization method to yield an exact and efficient alignment of the diffusion models, and provide the closed-form expression for the converged distribution. Empirical studies on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that AliDiff can generate molecules with state-of-the-art binding energies with up to -7.07 Avg. Vina Score, while maintaining strong molecular properties.</description>

      <title>QuST: QuPath Extension for Integrative Whole Slide Image and Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, various technologies have been introduced into digital pathology, including artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods, in both areas of pathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis and spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis. AI-driven WSI analysis utilizes the power of deep learning (DL), expands the field of view for histopathological image analysis. On the other hand, ST bridges the gap between tissue spatial analysis and biological signals, offering the possibility to understand the spatial biology. However, a major bottleneck in DL-based WSI analysis is the preparation of training patterns, as hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) staining does not provide direct biological evidence, such as gene expression, for determining the category of a biological component. On the other hand, as of now, the resolution in ST is far beyond that of WSI, resulting the challenge of further spatial analysis. Although various WSI analysis tools, including QuPath, have cited the use of WSI analysis tools in the context of ST analysis, its usage is primarily focused on initial image analysis, with other tools being utilized for more detailed transcriptomic analysis. As a result, the information hidden beneath WSI has not yet been fully utilized to support ST analysis.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce QuST, a QuPath extension designed to bridge the gap between H&amp;E WSI and ST analyzing tasks. In this paper, we highlight the importance of integrating DL-based WSI analysis and ST analysis in understanding disease biology and the challenges in integrating these modalities due to differences in data formats and analytical methods. The QuST source code is hosted on GitHub and documentation is available at (https://github.com/huangch/qust).</description>

      <title>Using eye tracking to investigate what native Chinese speakers notice about linguistic landscape images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linguistic landscape is an important field in sociolinguistic research. Eye tracking technology is a common technology in psychological research. There are few cases of using eye movement to study linguistic landscape. This paper uses eye tracking technology to study the actual fixation of the linguistic landscape and finds that in the two dimensions of fixation time and fixation times, the fixation of native Chinese speakers to the linguistic landscape is higher than that of the general landscape. This paper argues that this phenomenon is due to the higher information density of linguistic landscapes. At the same time, the article also discusses other possible reasons for this phenomenon.</description>
