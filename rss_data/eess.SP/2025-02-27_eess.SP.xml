      <title>Transfer Learning Assisted Fast Design Migration Over Technology Nodes: A Study on Transformer Matching Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce an innovative methodology for the design of mm-Wave passive networks that leverages knowledge transfer from a pre-trained synthesis neural network (NN) model in one technology node and achieves swift and reliable design adaptation across different integrated circuit (IC) technologies, operating frequencies, and metal options. We prove this concept through simulation-based demonstrations focusing on the training and comparison of the coefficient of determination (R2) of synthesis NNs for 1:1 on-chip transformers in GlobalFoundries(GF) 22nm FDX+ (target domain), with and without transfer learning from a model trained in GF 45nm SOI (source domain). In the experiments, we explore varying target data densities of 0.5%, 1%, 5%, and 100% with a complete dataset of 0.33 million in GF 22FDX+, and for comparative analysis, apply source data densities of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% with a complete dataset of 2.5 million in GF 45SOI. With the source data only at 30GHz, the experiments span target data from two metal options in GF 22FDX+ at frequencies of 30 and 39 GHz. The results prove that the transfer learning with the source domain knowledge (GF 45SOI) can both accelerate the training process in the target domain (GF 22FDX+) and improve the R2 values compared to models without knowledge transfer. Furthermore, it is observed that a model trained with just 5% of target data and augmented by transfer learning achieves R2 values superior to a model trained with 20% of the data without transfer, validating the advantage seen from 1% to 5% data density. This demonstrates a notable reduction of 4X in the necessary dataset size highlighting the efficacy of utilizing transfer learning to mm-Wave passive network design. The PyTorch learning and testing code is publicly available at https://github.com/ChenhaoChu/RFIC-TL.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the secrecy performance of an uplink device-to-device (D2D) communication system enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) while considering the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. RIS technology is employed to improve wireless communication environment by intelligently reflecting signals, thereby improving both capacity and security. We employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize resource allocation dynamically, addressing challenges in D2D pairs and optimizing RIS positioning and phase shifts in a changing wireless environment. Our simulations demonstrate that the developed DRL-based framework significantly maximizes the sum secrecy capacity of both D2D and cellular communications, achieving higher transmission secrecy rates compared to existing benchmarks. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating RIS with D2D communications for improved security performance.</description>

      <title>MTCA: Multi-Task Channel Analysis for Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern wireless communication systems, the effective processing of Channel State Information (CSI) is crucial for enhancing communication quality and reliability. However, current methods often handle different tasks in isolation, thereby neglecting the synergies among various tasks and leading to extract CSI features inadequately for subsequent analysis. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel Multi-Task Channel Analysis framework named MTCA, aimed at improving the performance of wireless communication even sensing. MTCA is designed to handle four critical tasks, including channel prediction, antenna-domain channel extrapolation, channel identification, and scenario classification. Experiments conducted on a multi-scenario, multi-antenna dataset tailored for UAV-based communications demonstrate that the proposed MTCA exhibits superior comprehension of CSI, achieving enhanced performance across all evaluated tasks. Notably, MTCA reached 100% prediction accuracy in channel identification and scenario classification. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods, MTCA improved channel prediction performance by 20.1% and antenna-domain extrapolation performance by 54.5%.</description>

      <title>Towards ISAC RIS-Enabled Passive Radar Target Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating integrated sensing and communication capabilities into forthcoming 6G wireless networks is crucial for achieving seamless synchronization between the digital and physical worlds. The following paper focuses on a scenario where a passive radar (PR) is subject to weak line-of-sight signals of opportunity, emanating from an access point and subsequently reflecting off targets, ultimately reaching the PR. Furthermore, a normalized least mean squares method is presented for jointly detecting the number of targets and estimating target angles of arrival (AoAs). The algorithm iteratively adjusts the steering vector estimates to minimize a suitable error cost function, while the target AoAs are identified via a peak-finding search conducted on the resulted power spectrum. Simulation results show the capabilities of the proposed localization method, as well as a 14 dB dynamic range reduction that can be achieved at the PR.</description>

      <title>Music Therapy based Stress Prediction using Homological Feature Analysis on EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress became a common factor in the busy daily routines of all academic and corporate working environments. Everyone checks for efficient stress-buster alternatives to calm down from work pressure. Instead of investing time in unnecessary efforts, this work shows the stress relief scenario of subjects by listening to Raag Darbari music notes as a simple add-on to their schedule. An innovative approach has been implemented on the MUSEI-EEG dataset using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to analyze this stress relief study. This study reveals that persistent homological features can be robust biomarkers for classifying closely distributed subject data. The proposed TDA approach framework revealed homological features like birth-death rate and entropy efficacy in stress prediction using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with 86% average accuracy and 0.2 standard deviation.</description>

      <title>DFT-based Near-field Beam Alignment: Model-based and Data-Driven Hybrid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate beam alignment is a critical challenge in XL-MIMO systems, especially in the near-field regime, where conventional far-field assumptions no longer hold. Although 2D grid-based codebooks in the polar domain are widely accepted for capturing near-field effects, they often suffer from high complexity and inefficiency in both time and computational resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel line-of-sight (LoS) near-field beam alignment scheme that leverages the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, which is commonly used in far-field environments. This approach ensures backward compatibility with the legacy DFT codebook for far-field signals by allowing its reuse. By introducing a new method to analyze the energy spread effect, we define the concept of an $\epsilon$-approximated signal subspace, spanned by DFT vectors that exhibit significant correlation with the near-field channel vector. Building on this analysis, the proposed hybrid scheme integrates model-based principles with data-driven techniques. Specifically, it utilizes the properties of the DFT matrix for efficient coarse alignment while employing a deep neural network (DNN)-aided fine alignment process. The fine alignment operates within the reduced search space defined by the coarse alignment stage, significantly enhancing accuracy while reducing complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior alignment performance while reducing both computational and model complexity compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>KAN-powered large-target detection for automotive radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel radar signal detection pipeline focused on detecting large targets such as cars and SUVs. Traditional methods, such as Ordered-Statistic Constant False Alarm Rate (OS-CFAR), commonly used in automotive radar, are designed for point or isotropic target models. These may not adequately capture the Range-Doppler (RD) scattering patterns of larger targets, especially in high-resolution radar systems. Additional modules such as association and tracking are necessary to refine and consolidate the detections over multiple dwells. To address these limitations, we propose a detection technique based on the probability density function (pdf) of RD segments, leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold neural network (KAN) to learn the data and generate interpretable symbolic expressions for binary hypotheses. Beside the Monte-Carlo study showing better performance for the proposed KAN expression over OS-CFAR, it is shown to exhibit a probability of detection (PD) of 96% when transfer learned with field data. The false alarm rate (PFA) is comparable with OS-CFAR designed with PFA = $10^{-6}$. Additionally, the study also examines impact of the number of pdf bins representing RD segment on performance of the KAN-based detection.</description>

      <title>Robust Over-the-Air Computation with Type-Based Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper utilizes the properties of type-based multiple access (TBMA) to investigate its effectiveness as a robust approach for over-the-air computation (AirComp) in the presence of Byzantine attacks, this is, adversarial strategies where malicious nodes intentionally distort their transmissions to corrupt the aggregated result. Unlike classical direct aggregation (DA) AirComp, which aggregates data in the amplitude of the signals and are highly vulnerable to attacks, TBMA distributes data over multiple radio resources, enabling the receiver to construct a histogram representation of the transmitted data. This structure allows the integration of classical robust estimators and supports the computation of diverse functions beyond the arithmetic mean, which is not feasible with DA. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that robust TBMA significantly outperforms DA, maintaining high accuracy even under adversarial conditions, and showcases its applicability in federated learning (FEEL) scenarios. Additionally, TBMA reduces channel state information (CSI) requirements, lowers energy consumption, and enhances resiliency by leveraging the diversity of the transmitted data. These results establish TBMA as a scalable and robust solution for AirComp, paving the way for secure and efficient aggregation in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Circulant ADMM-Net for Fast High-resolution DoA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces CADMM-Net and CHADMM-Net, two deep neural networks for direction of arrival estimation within the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) framework. These two networks are based on a structured deep unfolding of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm through the use of circulant as well as Hermitian-circulant matrices. Along with a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ per layer for the inference, where $N$ is the length of the dictionary $\mathbf{A}$, they additionally exhibit a memory footprint of $N$ and approximately half of $N$ for CADMMNet and CHADMM-Net, respectively, compared with $N^{2}$ for ADMM-Net. Furthermore, these structured networks exhibit a competitive performance against ADMM-Net, LISTA, TLISTA, and THLISTA with respect to the detection rate, the angular root-mean square error, and the normalized mean squared error.</description>

      <title>Beamforming and Waveform Optimization for RF Wireless Power Transfer with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising technology to seamlessly charge low-power devices, but its low end-to-end power transfer efficiency remains a critical challenge. To address the latter, low-cost transmit/radiating architectures, e.g., based on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), have shown great potential. Beyond diagonal (BD) RIS is a novel branch of RIS offering enhanced performance over traditional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) in wireless communications, but its potential gains in RF-WPT remain unexplored. Motivated by this, we analyze a BD-RIS-assisted single-antenna RF-WPT system to charge a single rectifier, and formulate a joint beamforming and multi-carrier waveform optimization problem aiming to maximize the harvested power. We propose two solutions relying on semi-definite programming for fully connected BD-RIS and an efficient low-complexity iterative method relying on successive convex approximation. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms converge to a local optimum and that adding transmit sub-carriers or RIS elements improves the harvesting performance. We show that the transmit power budget impacts the relative power allocation among different sub-carriers depending on the rectifier's operating regime, while BD-RIS shapes the cascade channel differently for frequency-selective and flat scenarios. Finally, we verify by simulation that BD-RIS and D-RIS achieve the same performance under pure far-field line-of-sight conditions (in the absence of mutual coupling). Meanwhile, BD-RIS outperforms D-RIS as the non-line-of-sight components of the channel become dominant.</description>

      <title>Integrating Biological and Machine Intelligence: Attention Mechanisms in Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, attention mechanisms have become indispensable in electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis, significantly enhancing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. This paper presents a comprehensive review of traditional and Transformer-based attention mechanisms, their embedding strategies, and their applications in EEG-based BCI, with a particular emphasis on multimodal data fusion. By capturing EEG variations across time, frequency, and spatial channels, attention mechanisms improve feature extraction, representation learning, and model robustness. These methods can be broadly categorized into traditional attention mechanisms, which typically integrate with convolutional and recurrent networks, and Transformer-based multi-head self-attention, which excels in capturing long-range dependencies. Beyond single-modality analysis, attention mechanisms also enhance multimodal EEG applications, facilitating effective fusion between EEG and other physiological or sensory data. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and emerging trends in attention-based EEG modeling, highlighting future directions for advancing BCI technology. This review aims to provide valuable insights for researchers seeking to leverage attention mechanisms for improved EEG interpretation and application.</description>

      <title>Pilot and Data Power Control for Uplink Cell-free massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel iterative algorithm for optimizing pilot and data power control (PC) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems, aiming to enhance system performance under real-time channel conditions. The approach begins by deriving the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) using a matched filtering receiver and formulating a min-max optimization problem to minimize the normalized mean square error (NMSE). Utilizing McCormick relaxation, the algorithm adjusts pilot power dynamically, ensuring efficient channel estimation. A subsequent max-min optimization problem allocates data power, balancing fairness and efficiency. The iterative process refines pilot and data power allocations based on updated channel state information (CSI) and NMSE results, optimizing spectral efficiency. By leveraging geometric programming (GP) for data power allocation, the proposed method achieves a robust trade-off between simplicity and performance, significantly improving system capacity and fairness. The simulation results demonstrate that dynamic adjustment of both pilot and data PC substantially enhances overall spectral efficiency and fairness, outperforming the existing schemes in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high subject-independent accuracy in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains a challenge, particularly when minimizing the number of channels. This study proposes a novel feature extraction scheme and a Pearson correlation-based channel selection algorithm to enhance classification accuracy while reducing hardware complexity. Using an open-access fNIRS dataset, our method improved average accuracy by 28.09% compared to existing approaches, achieving a peak subject-independent accuracy of 95.98% with only two channels. These results demonstrate the potential of our optimized feature extraction and channel selection methods for developing efficient, subject-independent fNIRS-based BCI systems.</description>

      <title>O-RIS-ing: Evaluating RIS-Assisted NextG Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) pose as a transformative technology to revolutionize the cellular architecture of Next Generation (NextG) Radio Access Networks (RANs). Previous studies have demonstrated the capabilities of RISs in optimizing wireless propagation, achieving high spectral efficiency, and improving resource utilization. At the same time, the transition to softwarized, disaggregated, and virtualized architectures, such as those being standardized by the O-RAN ALLIANCE, enables the vision of a reconfigurable Open RAN. In this work, we aim to integrate these technologies by studying how different resource allocation policies enhance the performance of RIS-assisted Open RANs. We perform a comparative analysis among various network configurations and show how proper network optimization can enhance the performance across the Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) network slices, achieving up to ~34% throughput improvement. Furthermore, leveraging the capabilities of OpenRAN Gym, we deploy an xApp on Colosseum, the world's largest wireless system emulator with hardware-in-the-loop, to control the Base Station (BS)'s scheduling policy. Experimental results demonstrate that RIS-assisted topologies achieve high resource efficiency and low latency, regardless of the BS's scheduling policy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (MMW) technology has been widely utilized in human security screening applications due to its superior penetration capabilities through clothing and safety for human exposure. However, existing methods largely rely on fixed polarization modes, neglecting the potential insights from variations in target echoes with respect to incident polarization. This study provides a theoretical analysis of the cross-polarization echo power as a function of the incident polarization angle under linear polarization conditions. Additionally, based on the transmission characteristics of multi-layer medium, we extended the depth spectrum model employed in direct detection to accommodate scenarios involving multi-layered structures. Building on this foundation, by obtaining multiple depth spectrums through polarization angle scanning, we propose the Polarization Angle-Depth Matrix to characterize target across both the polarization angle and depth dimensions in direct detection. Simulations and experimental validations confirm its accuracy and practical value in detecting concealed weapons in human security screening scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we proposed the use of JT65A radio communication protocol for data exchange in wide-area monitoring systems in electric power systems. We investigated the software demodulation of the multiple frequency shift keying weak signals transmitted with JT65A communication protocol using deep convolutional neural network. We presented the demodulation performance in form of symbol and bit error rates. We focused on the interference immunity of the protocol over an additive white Gaussian noise with average signal-to-noise ratios in the range from -30 dB to 0 dB, which was obtained for the first time. We proved that the interference immunity is about 1.5 dB less than the theoretical limit of non-coherent demodulation of orthogonal MFSK signals.</description>

      <title>Design of Cavity Backed Slotted Antenna using Machine Learning Regression Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a regression-based machine learning model is used for the design of cavity backed slotted antenna. This type of antenna is commonly used in military and aviation communication systems. Initial reflection coefficient data of cavity backed slotted antenna is generated using electromagnetic solver. These reflection coefficient data is then used as input for training regression-based machine learning model. The model is trained to predict the dimensions of cavity backed slotted antenna based on the input reflection coefficient for a wide frequency band varying from 1 GHz to 8 GHz. This approach allows for rapid prediction of optimal antenna configurations, reducing the need for repeated physical testing and manual adjustments, may lead to significant amount of design and development cost saving. The proposed model also demonstrates its versatility in predicting multi frequency resonance across 1 GHz to 8 GHz. Also, the proposed approach demonstrates the potential for leveraging machine learning in advanced antenna design, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in practical applications such as radar, military identification systems and secure communication networks.</description>

      <title>Generalizable deep learning for photoplethysmography-based blood pressure estimation -- A Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based blood pressure (BP) estimation represents a promising alternative to cuff-based BP measurements. Recently, an increasing number of deep learning models have been proposed to infer BP from the raw PPG waveform. However, these models have been predominantly evaluated on in-distribution test sets, which immediately raises the question of the generalizability of these models to external datasets. To investigate this question, we trained five deep learning models on the recently released PulseDB dataset, provided in-distribution benchmarking results on this dataset, and then assessed out-of-distribution performance on several external datasets. The best model (XResNet1d101) achieved in-distribution MAEs of 9.4 and 6.0 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP respectively on PulseDB (with subject-specific calibration), and 14.0 and 8.5 mmHg respectively without calibration. Equivalent MAEs on external test datasets without calibration ranged from 15.0 to 25.1 mmHg (SBP) and 7.0 to 10.4 mmHg (DBP). Our results indicate that the performance is strongly influenced by the differences in BP distributions between datasets. We investigated a simple way of improving performance through sample-based domain adaptation and put forward recommendations for training models with good generalization properties. With this work, we hope to educate more researchers for the importance and challenges of out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in Poisson imaging problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image restoration problems are often ill-posed, leading to significant uncertainty in reconstructed images. Accurately quantifying this uncertainty is essential for the reliable interpretation of reconstructed images. However, image restoration methods often lack uncertainty quantification capabilities. Conformal prediction offers a rigorous framework to augment image restoration methods with accurate uncertainty quantification estimates, but it typically requires abundant ground truth data for calibration. This paper presents a self-supervised conformal prediction method for Poisson imaging problems which leverages Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator to eliminate the need for ground truth data. The resulting self-calibrating conformal prediction approach is applicable to any Poisson linear imaging problem that is ill-conditioned, and is particularly effective when combined with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques trained directly on measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring; its performance are comparable to supervised conformal prediction methods relying on ground truth data.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Wireless Users' Locations via Modulation Classification-based Passive Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broadcast nature of the wireless medium and openness of wireless standards, e.g., 3GPP releases 16-20, invite adversaries to launch various active and passive attacks on cellular and other wireless networks. This work identifies one such loose end of wireless standards and presents a novel passive attack method enabling an eavesdropper (Eve) to localize a line of sight wireless user (Bob) who is communicating with a base station or WiFi access point (Alice). The proposed attack involves two phases. In the first phase, Eve performs modulation classification by intercepting the downlink channel between Alice and Bob. This enables Eve to utilize the publicly available modulation and coding scheme (MCS) tables to do pesudo-ranging, i.e., the Eve determines the ring within which Bob is located, which drastically reduces the search space. In the second phase, Eve sniffs the uplink channel, and employs multiple strategies to further refine Bob's location within the ring. Towards the end, we present our thoughts on how this attack can be extended to non-line-of-sight scenarios, and how this attack could act as a scaffolding to construct a malicious digital twin map.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Weighted Projection for Reliable Low-Complexity Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage weighted projection method (TS-WPM) for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization, providing provable improvements in positioning accuracy, particularly under high geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. TS-WPM employs a two-stage iterative refinement approach that dynamically updates both range and position estimates, effectively mitigating residual errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we extend TS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in scenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its error covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions for its optimality and robustness. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we develop a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant analytical framework, incorporating 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer aspects as well as large-scale and small-scale fading. As part of this, we derive a generalized Cram{\'e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath propagation and introduce a novel non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias model that accounts for propagation conditions and SNR variations. Our evaluations demonstrate that TS-WPM achieves near-CRLB performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) in high GDOP and low SNR scenarios. Moreover, cooperative localization with TS-WPM significantly enhances accuracy, especially when an insufficient number of anchors (such as 2) are visible. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of TS-WPM, showing its balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable solution for real-time localization in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machine (SoM)-Driven Analog Precoder Optimization for Enhanced ISAC Performance in Sub-THz Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential benefits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are anticipated to play a significant role in future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) mobile information networks. However, the beam squint effect is pronounced in sub-THz systems, expanding coverage areas while severely degrading the communication performance. Existing analog precoder designs struggle to balance both functionalities in the presence of beam squint, limiting the performance gain achievable through ISAC. To address this challenge, we propose two squint-aware analog precoding schemes for sub-THz systems that proactively regulate the correlation between communication and sensing channels, leveraging the inherent degrees of freedom in the hardware architecture to enhance ISAC performance. We first introduce a squint-aware optimization-based analog precoder design approach (SA-Opt). Inspired by the synesthesia of machine (SoM), we further develop an unsupervised learning-assisted complex-valued squint-aware network (CSP-Net) to reduce complexity based on both communication and sensing channel data, tailoring its architecture to the specific data and task characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Secure Beamforming for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous aperture array (CAPA) is considered a promising technology for 6G networks, offering the potential to fully exploit spatial DoFs and achieve the theoretical limits of channel capacity. This paper investigates the performance gain of a CAPA-based downlink secure transmission system, where multiple legitimate user terminals (LUTs) coexist with multiple eavesdroppers (Eves). The system's secrecy performance is evaluated using a weighted secrecy sum-rate (WSSR) under a power constraint. We then propose two solutions for the secure current pattern design. The first solution is a block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization method based on fractional programming, which introduces a continuous-function inversion theory corresponding to matrix inversion in the discrete domain. This approach derives a closed-form expression for the optimal source current pattern. Based on this, it can be found that the optimal current pattern is essentially a linear combination of the channel spatial responses, thus eliminating the need for complex integration operations during the algorithm's optimization process. The second solution is a heuristic algorithm based on Zero-Forcing (ZF), which constructs a zero-leakage current pattern using the channel correlation matrix. It further employs a water-filling approach to design an optimal power allocation scheme that maximizes the WSSR. In high SNR regions, this solution gradually approaches the first solution, ensuring zero leakage while offering lower computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) CAPA-based systems achieve better WSSR compared to discrete multiple-input multiple-output systems. 2) The proposed methods, whether optimization-based or heuristic, provide significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art Fourier-based discretization methods, while considerably reducing computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: The analysis of lifelogs can yield valuable insights into an individual's daily life, particularly with regard to their health and well-being. The accurate assessment of quality of life is necessitated by the use of diverse sensors and precise synchronization. To rectify this issue, this study proposes the image-based sleep quality and stress level estimation flow (PixleepFlow). PixleepFlow employs a conversion methodology into composite image data to examine sleep patterns and their impact on overall health. Experiments were conducted using lifelog datasets to ascertain the optimal combination of data formats. In addition, we identified which sensor information has the greatest influence on the quality of life through Explainable Artificial Intelligence(XAI). As a result, PixleepFlow produced more significant results than various data formats. This study was part of a written-based competition, and the additional findings from the lifelog dataset are detailed in Section Section IV. More information about PixleepFlow can be found at https://github.com/seongjiko/Pixleep.</description>

Abstract: Sleep profoundly affects our health, and sleep deficiency or disorders can cause physical and mental problems. % Despite significant findings from previous studies, challenges persist in optimizing deep learning models, especially in multi-modal learning for high-accuracy sleep stage classification. Our research introduces MC2SleepNet (Multi-modal Cross-masking with Contrastive learning for Sleep stage classification Network). It aims to facilitate the effective collaboration between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures for multi-modal training with the help of contrastive learning and cross-masking. % Raw single channel EEG signals and corresponding spectrogram data provide differently characterized modalities for multi-modal learning. Our MC2SleepNet has achieved state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of both 84.6% on the SleepEDF-78 and 88.6% accuracy on the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). These results demonstrate the effective generalization of our proposed network across both small and large datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ECG-Expert-QA, a comprehensive multimodal dataset designed for evaluating diagnostic capabilities in ECG interpretation, integrating real clinical data with systematically generated synthetic cases. The dataset encompasses six fundamental diagnostic tasks, comprising 47,211 meticulously curated question-answer pairs that span a spectrum of clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm analysis to complex case interpretation. By simulating challenging clinical cases through a rigorous medical knowledge-guided process, ECG-Expert-QA not only enhances the availability of annotated diagnostic data but also significantly increases the complexity and diversity of clinical presentations, including rare cardiac conditions and temporal progression patterns. This design enables comprehensive evaluation of medical language models across multiple dimensions, including diagnostic accuracy, clinical reasoning, and knowledge integration. To facilitate global research collaboration, ECG-Expert-QA is available in both Chinese and English versions, with rigorous quality control ensuring linguistic and clinical consistency. The dataset's challenging diagnostic tasks, which include interpretation of complex arrhythmias, identification of subtle ischemic changes, and integration of clinical context, establish it as an effective benchmark for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation and pushing the boundaries of current diagnostic models. Our dataset is open-source and available at https://github.com/Zaozzz/ECG-Expert-QA</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a joint active and passive beamforming design for distributed simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multi-user (MU)- mutiple input single output (MISO) systems, where the energy splitting (ES) mode is considered for the STAR-RIS. We aim to design the active beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS to maximize the user sum rate under transmitting power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and nontrivial to obtain the global optimum due to the coupling between active beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS phase shifts. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based framework. Specifically, we first model the interactions among users and network entities are using a heterogeneous graph representation. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) implementation is then introduced to directly optimizes beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients with the system objective. Numerical results show that the proposed approach yields efficient performance compared to the previous benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed GNN is scalable with various system configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS)/movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model, as a simplified implementation of six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA), to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the proposed RA system can independently and flexibly change the three-dimensional (3D) orientation/boresight of each antenna by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve desired channel realizations. Specifically, we study an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the base station (BS). In the general multi-user and multi-path setup, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles in an iterative manner. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed RA-enabled system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

Different from conventional fixed antennas, the proposed RA system can flexibly alter the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna independently by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve a desired array directional gain pattern. Specifically, we investigate an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs at the base station (BS) are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles of RAs are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the BS. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance with an infinite number of antennas based on this solution, which theoretically proves that the RA system can achieve a higher array gain as compared to the fixed-antenna system. In the general multi-user and multi-path channel setup, we first propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of RAs in an iterative manner. Then, a two-stage algorithm that solves the formulated problem without the need for iteration is further proposed to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results are provided to validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the proposed RA system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel split learning architecture designed to exploit the cyclical movement of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). Although existing research focuses on offloading tasks to the NTN infrastructure, these approaches overlook the dynamic movement patterns of LEO satellites that can be used to efficiently distribute the learning task. In this work, we analyze how LEO satellites, from the perspective of ground terminals, can participate in a time-window-based model training. By splitting the model between a LEO and a ground terminal, the computational burden on the satellite segment is reduced, while each LEO satellite offloads the partially trained model to the next satellite in the constellation. This cyclical training process allows larger and more energy-intensive models to be deployed and trained across multiple LEO satellites, despite their limited energy resources. We formulate an optimization problem that manages radio and processing resources, ensuring the entire data is processed during each satellite pass while minimizing the energy consumption. Our results demonstrate that this approach offers a more scalable and energy-efficient way to train complex models, enhancing the capabilities of LEO satellite constellations in the context of Artificial Intelligence-driven applications.</description>
