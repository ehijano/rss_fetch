      <title>The quantum Mpemba effect in long-range spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the manifestations of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is that a tilted ferromagnet exhibits faster restoration of the spin-rotational symmetry after a quantum quench when starting from a larger tilt angle. This phenomenon has recently been observed experimentally in an ion trap that simulates a long-range spin chain. However, the underlying mechanism of the QME in the presence of long-range interactions remains unclear. Using the time-dependent spin-wave theory, we investigate the dynamical restoration of the spin-rotational symmetry and the QME in generic long-range spin systems. We show that quantum fluctuations of the magnetization drive the restoration of symmetry by melting the initial ferromagnetic order and are responsible for the QME. We find that this effect occurs across a wide parameter range in long-range systems, in contrast to its absence in some short-range counterparts.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Simplest Deconfined Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $N=3$ case of the $CP^{N-1}$ model, which is a field theory of $N$ complex scalars in $3d$ coupled to an Abelian gauge field with $SU(N) \times U(1)$ global symmetry. Recent evidence suggests the $N=2$ theory is not critical, which makes the $N=3$ theory the simplest possibility of deconfined quantum criticality. We apply the conformal bootstrap to correlators of charge $q=0,1,2$ scalar operators under the $U(1)$ symmetry, which gives us access also to $q=3,4$ operators. After imposing that only the lowest $q=0,1,2$ scalar operators are relevant, we find that the bootstrap bounds are saturated by the large $N$ prediction for $q=1,2,3,4$ scalar monopole operator scaling dimensions, which were shown earlier to be accurate even for small $N$, as well as a lattice prediction for the $q=0$ non-monopole scalar operator. We also predict the scaling dimensions of the lowest spinning monopole operators, which we match to the large charge prediction for spinning operators. This suggests that the critical $CP^{2}$ model is described by this bootstrap bound.</description>

      <title>Does an intermittent dynamical system remain (weakly) chaotic after drilling in a hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems are often characterised by a positive Lyapunov exponent, which signifies an exponential rate of separation of nearby trajectories. However, in a wide range of so-called weakly chaotic systems, the separation of nearby trajectories is sub-exponential in time, and the Lyapunov exponent vanishes. When a hole is introduced in chaotic systems, the positive Lyapunov exponents on the system's fractal repeller can be related to the generation of metric entropy and the escape rate from the system. The escape rate, in turn, cross-links these two chaos properties to important statistical-physical quantities like the diffusion coefficient. However, no suitable generalisation of this escape rate formalism exists for weakly chaotic systems. In our paper we show that in a paradigmatic one-dimensional weakly chaotic iterated map, the Pomeau-Manneville map, a generalisation of its Lyapunov exponent (which we call `stretching') is completely suppressed in the presence of a hole. This result is based on numerical evidence and a corresponding stochastic model. The correspondence between map and model is tested via a related partially absorbing map. We examine the structure of the map's fractal repeller, which we reconstruct via a simple algorithm. Our findings are in line with rigorous mathematical results concerning the collapse of the system's density as it evolves in time. We also examine the generation of entropy in the open map, which is shown to be consistent with the collapsed stretching. As a result, we conclude that no suitable generalisation of the escape rate formalism to weakly chaotic systems can exist.</description>

      <title>Solving boundary time crystals via the superspin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary time crystals have been extensively studied through numerical and mean-field methods. However, a comprehensive analytical approach in terms of the Liouvillian eigenvalues, without semiclassical approximations, has yet to be developed. In this work, we analyse the Liouvillian spectrum of dissipative spin models, within a perturbative framework in the weak-dissipation limit. Introducing the superspin method, we compute the eigenvalues to first order in perturbation theory, providing a direct and transparent explanation for the emergence of the time crystal phase. We analytically demonstrate how spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, leading to persistent oscillations. Our method can be used as a tool to unequivocally identify new dissipative collective spin models that support a boundary time crystal phase. We demonstrate this by applying the technique to four distinct, collective spin Liouvillians, which experience some dissipation. The first of these is the paradigmatic model studied in [1]. We demonstrate how the boundary time crystal phase is a general feature of models that yield a solution solely in terms of a quantity that we term the superspin. Furthermore, we analyse the stability of this phase and demonstrate how, in some cases, it is stable against increasing dissipation.</description>

      <title>L-based numerical linked cluster expansion for square lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical linked cluster expansion for square-lattice models whose building block is an L-shape cluster. For the spin-1/2 models studied in this work, we find that this expansion exhibits a similar or better convergence of the bare sums than that of the (larger) square-shaped clusters, and can be used with resummation techniques (like the site- and bond-based expansions) to obtain results at even lower temperatures. We compare the performance of weak- and strong-embedding versions of this expansion in various spin-1/2 models, and show that the strong-embedding version is preferable because of its convergence properties and lower computational cost. Finally, we show that the expansion based on the L-shape cluster can be naturally used to study properties of lattice models that smoothly connect the square and triangular lattice geometries.</description>

      <title>Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12103v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</description>

      <title>Optimal closed-loop control of active particles and a minimal information engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the elementary problem of moving an active particle by a trap with minimum work input. We show analytically that (open-loop) optimal protocols are not affected by activity, but work fluctuations are always increased. For closed-loop protocols, which rely on initial measurements of the self-propulsion, the average work has a minimum for a finite persistence time. Using these insights, we derive an optimal periodic active information engine, which is found to have higher precision and information efficiency when operated with a run-and-tumble particle than for an active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle and, we argue, than for any other type of active particle.</description>

      <title>Field theory for monitored Brownian SYK clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of multiple clusters of Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), i.e. systems of N Majorana fermions with a noisy interaction term. In addition to the unitary evolution, we introduce two-fermion monitorings. We construct a coherent states path integral of the dynamics by generalizing spin coherent states for higher symmetry groups. We then demonstrate that the evolution of the replicated density matrix can be described by an effective field theory for the "light" degrees of freedom, i.e. the quantum fluctuations generated by the unitary evolution. This method is applied to both quadratic, where the field theory reduces to the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), and also to interacting SYK clusters. We show that in the stationary regime, two monitored clusters exhibit linear-in-N entanglement, with a proportionality factor dependent on the strength of the unitary coupling.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Response Identities and Bounds for Nonequilibrium Steady States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19602v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is fundamental to statistical physics. For systems far from equilibrium, a general framework for response remains elusive. While progress has been made on the linear response of nonequilibrium systems, a theory for the nonlinear regime under finite perturbations has been lacking. Here, building on a novel connection between response and mean first-passage times in continuous-time Markov chains, we derive a comprehensive theory for the nonlinear response to archetypal local perturbations. We establish an exact identity that universally connects the nonlinear response of any observable to its linear counterpart via a simple scaling factor. This identity directly yields universal bounds on the response magnitude. Furthermore, we establish a universal bound on response resolution -- an inequality constraining an observable's change by its intrinsic fluctuations -- thereby setting a fundamental limit on signal-to-noise ratio. These results provide a rigorous and general framework for analyzing nonlinear response far from equilibrium, which we illustrate with an application to transcriptional regulation.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and for predicting how its statistical properties change when a perturbation is applied. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieve enhanced practical applicability, response theory should be interpretable, capable of focusing on relevant timescales, and amenable to data-driven and equation-agnostic implementations. Along these lines, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we present linear and nonlinear response formulas for Markov chains. We obtain simple and easily implementable expressions that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as of higher-order correlations. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if the underlying evolution equations are unknown. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allows to elucidate the role of different time scales and modes of variability, and to find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.</description>

Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) paradox, namely the lack of equipartition in the evolution of a normal mode in a nonlinear chain on unexpectedly long times, is arguably the most famous numerical experiment in the history of physics. Seventy years after the original publication, most studies in FPUT chains still focus on long wavelength initial states similar to the original paper. It is shown here that all characteristic features of the FPUT paradox are rendered even more striking if modes with short(er) wavelengths are evolved instead. Since not every normal mode leads to equipartition, we also provide a simple technique to predict which modes, and in what perturbation order, are excited starting from an initial mode (root) in $\alpha$-FPUT chains. The excitation sequences associated with a root are then numerically shown to spread energy at different speeds, leading to prethermalization regimes that become longer as a function of mode excitation number. This effect is visible in observables such as mode energies and spectral entropies and, surprisingly, also in the time evolution of invariant quantities such as Lyapunov times and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies. Our findings generalize the original FPUT experiment, provide an original look at the paradox's source, and enrich the vast literature dedicated to studying equipartition in classical many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian Motion with Negative Hurst Exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range $0&lt;H&lt;1$. Here we extend this definition to the strongly anti-persistent regime $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The extended fBm turns out to be stationary, and we derive its autocorrelation function. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also determine the variance of a closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.</description>

      <title>New universality classes govern the critical and multicritical behavior of an active Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ising model is one of the most well known models in statistical physics, with its critical behavior governed by the Wilson-Fisher universality class (UC). When active motility is incorporated into the Ising model by, e.g., dictating that the spins' directional movements follow their orientations, the spin number density necessarily constitutes a soft mode in the hydrodynamic description, and can therefore modify the scaling behavior of the system. Here, we show that this is indeed the case in a critical active Ising model in which density can impede the system's collective motion. Specifically, we use a perturbative dynamic renormalization group method to the one-loop level to uncover three new UCs, one of which supersedes the Wilson-Fisher UC to become the generic UC that governs the critical behavior of the active Ising model.</description>

Abstract: Several recent works have derived Lieb-Robinson bounds (LRBs) for Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. For certain structured initial states, e.g., vacuum perturbations or near-stationary states, information propagates with velocity $v \leq C$ . However, for general bounded-density initial states, it was shown by the first author, Vu, and Saito that the velocity can grow in time as $v \sim t^{D-1}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension -- demonstrating the possibility of accelerated information spreading in bosonic systems. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on this phenomenon: we show that translation invariance combined with local $p$-body repulsion ($n^p$ with $p &gt; D+1$) qualitatively alters the propagation behavior, leading to a bound of the form $v \sim t^{\frac{D}{p - D - 1}}$ for general bounded-energy-density initial states. In particular, this establishes for an almost-linear light cone at large $p$, in stark contrast to the previously found accelerated regimes. Our result identifies symmetry-driven constraints as a new mechanism for suppressing propagation speed in bosonic systems and thereby reframes the scope of what types of LRBs can hold. We further provide matching examples showing that, under the given assumptions, this bound is sharp -- no further improvement in the power of $t$ is possible without invoking additional dynamical constraints.</description>

      <title>On the difference between thermalization in open and isolated quantum systems: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.</description>

      <title>Integrability is generic in homogeneous U(1)-invariant nearest-neighbor qubit circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrability is an exceptional property believed to hold only for systems with fine-tuned parameters. Contrary, we explicitly show that in homogeneous nearest-neighbor qubit circuits with a U(1) symmetry, i.e., circuits that repeatedly apply the same magnetization-conserving two-qubit gate, this is not the case. There, integrability is generic: all such brickwall qubit circuits are integrable, even with a randomly selected gate. We identify two phases with different conservation laws, transport properties, and strong zero edge modes. Experimentally important is the fact that varying any one of the parameters in the generic U(1) gate, one will typically cross the critical manifold that separates the two phases. Finally, we report on an unconventional time-reversal symmetry causing the system with open boundary conditions to be in the orthogonal class, while the one with periodic boundary conditions is in the unitary class.</description>

      <title>Two-color laser control of photocurrent and high harmonics in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate two-color-laser-driven photocurrent and high harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene models. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, we uniformly explore a broad parameter regime including both the weak (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) cases while considering the dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the real-space path traced by the laser electric field. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zeroth order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and relative phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift- or injection-current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multicolor laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Thermal Analogs of Electric Circuits: A Universal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a panoramic schematic of quantum thermal analogs of electric circuits in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for heat currents and temperature gradients, as well as a quantum thermal step transformer. Using this, we develop two novel quantum thermal circuits, viz., quantum thermal super Wheatstone bridge and quantum thermal adder circuit, paving the way for the corresponding integrated circuits. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.</description>

      <title>Fundamental precision limits in finite-dimensional quantum thermal machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost. This notion was recently formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents decreases as entropy production increases. From another viewpoint, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation implies that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. This indicates that physical constraints impose fundamental precision limits on the system, independent of its dynamics. In this study, we derive dynamics-independent bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. These bounds are governed by the minimum eigenvalue factor, which sets the maximum entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and mirrors the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamics. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence affects these fundamental bounds, demonstrating that the presence of coherence can enhance the precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>

Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. We confirm that the time-integrated probability flux exhibits patterns consistent with the pathways identified in the projected hypercubic energy landscapes. Using the mean-field model, we show that dominant state transition pathways tend to emerge around the periphery of the projected hypercubes. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>
