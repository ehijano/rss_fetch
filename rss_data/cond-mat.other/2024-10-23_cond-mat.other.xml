      <title>Architecting mechanisms of damage in topological metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behavior of non-idealized Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. Using a beam element simulator, we systematically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <title>Transient amplification in stable Floquet media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mathieu equation occurs naturally in the description of vibrations or in the propagation of waves in media with time-periodic refractive index. It is known to lead to exponential parametric instability in some regions of the parameter space. However, even in the stable region the matrix that propagates the initial conditions forward in time is non-normal and therefore it can result in transient amplification. By optimizing over initial conditions as well as initial time we show that significant transient amplifications can be obtained, going beyond the one simply stemming from adiabatic invariance. Moreover, we explore the monodromy matrix in more depth, by studying its $\epsilon$-pseudospectra and Petermann factors, demonstrating that is the degree of non-normality of this matrix that determines the global amplifying features. In the context of wave propagation in time-varying media, this transient behavior allows us to display arbitrary amplification of the wave amplitude that is not due to exponential parametric instability.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature properties of string-net models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a refined version of the string-net model which assigns a different energy cost to each plaquette excitation. Using recent exact calculations of the energy-level degeneracies we compute the partition function of this model and investigate several thermodynamical quantities. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that the partition function is dominated by the contribution of special particles, dubbed pure fluxons, which trivially braid with all other (product of) fluxons. We also analyze the behavior of Wegner-Wilson loops associated to excitations and show that they obey an area law, indicating confinement, for any finite temperature except for pure fluxons that always remain deconfined. Finally, using a recently proposed conjecture, we compute the topological mutual information at finite temperature, which features a nontrivial scaling between system size and temperature, similar to the one-dimensional classical Ising model.</description>
