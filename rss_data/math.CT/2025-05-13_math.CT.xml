      <title>Non-singular maps in toposes with a local state classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress on the question of the size of the class of connected and hyperconnected geometric morphisms from a given topos has led to the definition of {\em local state classifier}. We discuss a historical precedent which leads to the notion of {\em non-singular map} and we show that, for a topos ${\cal E}$ with a local state classifier, and each object $X$ therein, the domain of the full subcategory of ${{\cal E}/X}$ consisting of non-singular maps over $X$ is a topos, and that the inclusion is the inverse image functor of a hyperconnected geometric morphism. The prospective geometric applications direct our attention to local state classifiers in toposes `of spaces'. We show that, at least in the pre-cohesive topos of reflexive graphs, the local state classifier, which is a colimit by definition, may be characterized as a limit; more specifically, as a variant of a subobject classifier.</description>

      <title>Reflective centers as categories of modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [LWY23] the authors construct the reflective center of a module category M over a braided monoidal category B. The reflective center is by construction a braided module category over B. In the case where B is the category of modules over a finite dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebra H, acting on the category of modules over a comodule algebra, they construct a comodule algebra, the reflective algebra, whose modules are precisely the reflective center. In the construction, Majid's transmutation of H plays a crucial r{\^o}le.  This note centers on the transmuted H, seeking to ''explain'' its appearance through a generalization in which the acting category is no longer a module category, but admits an internal reconstructed Hopf algebra; the transmutation is a special case of this notion. As a result, in certain cases, the reflective center is simply the category of modules in M over that Hopf algebra in B.</description>

      <title>Flatness in finitely accessible additive categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by some problems proposed by Cuadra and Simson related to flat objects in finitely accessible Grothendieck categories, we study flatness in the more general setting of finitely accessible additive categories. For such category $\mathcal{A}$, we characterize when $\mathcal{A}$ is preabelian and abelian. We prove that if the class of flat objects in $\mathcal A$ is closed under pure subobjects, then every flat object is a direct union of \textit{small} flat subobjects. Finally, we characterize when $\mathcal{A}$ has enough flat and projective objects and we prove that, in this case, the class of flat objects is closed under pure subobjects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish general categorical frameworks that extend Loewy's classification scheme for finite-dimensional real irreducible representations of groups and Borel--Tits' criterion for the existence of rational forms of representations of $\bar{F}\otimes_F G$ for a connected reductive algebraic group $G$ over a field $F$ of characteristic zero and its algebraic closure $\bar{F}$. We also discuss applications of these general formalisms to the theory of Harish-Chandra modules, specifically to classify irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over fields $F$ of characteristic zero and to identify smaller fields of definition of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over $\bar{F}$, particularly in the case of cohomological irreducible essentially unitarizable modules.</description>

      <title>Formal P-Category Theory and Normalization by Evaluation in Rocq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional category theory is typically based on set-theoretic principles and ideas, which are often non-constructive. An alternative approach to formalizing category theory is to use E-category theory, where hom sets become setoids. Our work reconsiders a third approach - P-category theory - from \v{C}ubri\'c et al. (1998) emphasizing a computational standpoint. We formalize in Rocq a modest library of P-category theory - where homs become subsetoids - and apply it to formalizing algorithms for normalization by evaluation which are purely categorical but, surprisingly, do not use neutral and normal terms. \v{C}ubri\'c et al. (1998) establish only a soundness correctness property by categorical means; here, we extend their work by providing a categorical proof also for a strong completeness property. For this we formalize the full universal property of the free Cartesian-closed category, which is not known to have been performed before. We further formalize a novel universal property of unquotiented simply typed lambda-calculus syntax and apply this to a proof of correctness of a categorical normalization by evaluation algorithm. We pair the overall mathematical development with a formalization in the Rocq proof assistant, following the principle that the formalization exists for practical computation. Indeed, it permits extraction of synthesized normalization programs that compute (long) beta-eta-normal forms of simply typed lambda-terms together with a derivation of beta-eta-conversion.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for Graded Monoidal Theories with an Application to Imprecise Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce string diagrams for graded symmetric monoidal categories. Our approach includes a definition of graded monoidal theory and the corresponding freely generated syntactic category. Also, we show how an axiomatic presentation for the graded theory may be modularly obtained from one for the grading theory and one for the base category. The Para construction on monoidal actegories is a motivating example for our framework. As a case study, we show how to axiomatise a variant of the graded category ImP, recently introduced by Liell-Cock and Staton to model imprecise probability. This culminates in a representation, as string diagrams with grading wires, of programs with primitives for nondeterministic and probabilistic choices and conditioning.</description>

      <title>Plethysm Products, Element and Plus Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by viewing categories as bimodule monoids over their isomorphism groupoids, we construct monoidal structures called plethysm products on three levels: that is for bimodules, relative bimodules and factorizable bimodules. For the bimodules, we work in the general setting of actions by categories. We give a comprehensive theory linking these levels to each other as well as to Grothendieck element constructions, indexed enrichments, decorations and algebras.
  Specializing to groupoid actions leads to applications including the plus construction. In this setting, the third level encompasses the known constructions of Baez-Dolan and its generalizations, as we prove. One new result is that that the plus construction can also be realized an element construction compatible with monoidal structures that we define. This allows us to prove a commutativity between element and plus constructions a special case of which was announced earlier. Specializing the results on the third level yield a criterion, when a definition of operad-like structure as a plethysm monoid -- as exemplified by operads -- is possible.</description>

      <title>Homology Generators and Relations for the Ordered Configuration Space of a Star Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ordered configuration spaces of star graphs. Inspired by the representation stability results of Church--Ellenberg--Farb for the ordered configuration space of a manifold and the edge stability results of An--Drummond-Cole--Knudsen for the unordered configuration space of a graph, we determine how the ordered configuration space of a star graph with $k$ leaves behaves as we add particles at the leaves. We show that, as a module over the combinatorial category FI$_{k, o}$, the first homology of this ordered configuration space is finitely generated by $4$ particles for $k=3$, by $3$ particles for $k=4$, and by $2$ particles for $k\ge 5$. Additionally, we prove that every relation among homology classes can be described by relations on at most $6$ particles for $k=4$, at most $5$ particles when $k=5$, at most $4$ particles when $k=6$, and at most $3$ particles for $k\ge 7$, while proving that adding particles always introduces new relations when $k=3$. This proves that there is no finite universal presentation for the homology of ordered configuration spaces of graphs.</description>

      <title>The decomposition space perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to decomposition spaces and 2-Segal spaces, unifying the two perspectives. We begin by defining decomposition spaces using the active-inert factorization system on the simplicial category, and show their equivalence to 2-Segal spaces. Key results include the path space criterion, which characterizes decomposition spaces in terms of their upper and lower d\'ecalages, and the edgewise subdivision criterion. We also introduce free decomposition spaces arising from outer face complexes, providing a rich source of examples. Formal prerequisites are minimal -- readers should have a working knowledge of simplicial methods and basic category theory.</description>

      <title>Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories: Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their descriptions by (mock) modular covariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760 closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Actions of Groups on Tensor Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a group $G$ and a 4-cocycle $\pi\in Z^{4}(G,\mathbb{k}^{\times})$, a $\pi$-anomalous action of $G$ on a linear monoidal category $C$ is a linear monoidal 2-functor between 3-groups $3\text{-Gr}(G,\pi)\rightarrow \text{2-Aut}_\otimes(C)$ where the latter denotes the 3-group of autoequivalences of $C$. Given $G$ and $\pi$, we provide a method of constructing anomalous actions of $3\text{-Gr}(G,\pi)$ on a tensor categories.</description>
