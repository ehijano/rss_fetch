      <title>The Highly Durable Antibacterial Gel-like Coatings for Textiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hospital-acquired infections are considered a priority for public health systems, which poses a significant burden for society. High-touch surfaces of healthcare centers, including textiles, provide a suitable environment for pathogenic bacteria to grow, necessitating incorporating effective antibacterial agents into textiles. This paper introduces a highly durable antibacterial gel-like solution, Silver Shell finish, which contains chitosan-bound silver chloride microparticles. The study investigates the coating's environmental impact, health risks, and durability during repeated washing. The structure of the Silver Shell finish was studied using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). TEM images showed a core-shell structure, with chitosan forming a protective shell around groupings of silver micro-particles. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) demonstrated the uniform deposition of Silver Shell on the surface of fabrics. AATCC Test Method 100 was employed to quantitatively analyze the antibacterial properties of fabrics coated with silver microparticles. Two types of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were used in this study. The antibacterial results showed that after 75 wash cycles, a 100% reduction for both S. aureus and E. coli in the coated samples using crosslinking agents was observed. The coated samples without a crosslinking agent exhibited a 99.88% and 99.81% reduction for S. aureus and E. coli after 50 washing cycles. AATCC-147 was performed to investigate the coated samples' leaching properties and the crosslinking agent's effect against S. aureus and E. coli. All coated samples demonstrated remarkable antibacterial efficacy even after 75 wash cycles.</description>
