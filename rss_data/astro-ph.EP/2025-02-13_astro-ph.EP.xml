      <title>The Magnetically Induced Radial Velocity Variation of Gliese 341 and an Upper Limit to the Mass of Its Transiting Earth-sized Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission identified a potential 0.88 REarth planet with a period of 7.577 days, orbiting the nearby M1V star GJ 341 (TOI 741.01). This system has already been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for presence of an atmosphere on this planet. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the GJ 341 system using all available public data. We provide improved parameters for the host star, an updated value of the planet radius, and support the planetary nature of the object (now GJ 341 b). We use 57 HARPS radial velocities to model the magnetic cycle and activity of the host star, and constrain the mass of GJ 341 b to upper limits of 4.0 MEarth (3 sigma) and 2.9 MEarth (1 sigma). We also rule out the presence of additional companions with M sin i &gt; 15.1 MEarth, and P &lt; 1750 days, and the presence of contaminating background objects during the TESS and JWST observations. These results provide key information to aid the interpretation of the recent JWST atmospheric observations and other future observations of this planet.</description>

      <title>Prospects for biological evolution on Hycean worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the atmosphere of a candidate Hycean world, K2-18 b, with JWST are opening the prospects for characterising potential biospheres on temperate exoplanets. Hycean worlds are a recently theorised class of habitable exoplanets with ocean covered surfaces and hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Hycean planets are thought to be conducive for hosting microbial life under conditions similar to those in the Earth's oceans. In the present work we investigate the potential for biological evolution on Hycean worlds and their dependence on the thermodynamic conditions. We find that a large range of evolutionary rates and origination times are possible for unicellular life in oceanic environments for a relatively marginal range in environmental conditions. For example, a relatively small (10 K) increase in the average ocean temperature can lead to over twice the evolutionary rates, with key unicellular groups originating as early as $\sim$1.3 billion years from origin of life. On the contrary, similar decreases in temperatures can also significantly delay the origination times by several billion years. This delay in turn could affect their observable biomarkers such as dimethylsulfide, which is known to be produced predominantly by Eukaryotic marine phytoplankton in Earth's oceans. Therefore, Hycean worlds that are significantly cooler than Earth may be expected to host simpler microbial life than Earth's oceans and may show weaker biosignatures, unless they orbit significantly older stars than the Sun. Conversely, Hycean worlds with warmer surface temperatures than Earth are more likely to show stronger atmospheric biosignatures due to microbial life if present.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Distances to Asteroids from One Observatory in One Night with Upcoming All-Sky Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming telescopes like the Vera Rubin Observatory (VRO) and the Argus Array will image large fractions of the sky multiple times per night yielding numerous Near Earth Object (NEO) discoveries. When asteroids are measured with short observation time windows, the dominant uncertainty in orbit construction is due to distance uncertainty to the NEO. One approach to recover distances is from topocentric parallax, which is a technique that leverages the rotation of the Earth, causing a small but detectable sinusoidal additive signal to the Right Ascension (RA) of the NEO following a period of 1 day. In this paper, we further develop and evaluate this technique to recover distances in as quickly as a single night. We first test the technique on synthetic data of 19 different asteroids ranging from $\sim0.05 \,\text{AU}$ to $\sim2.4 \,\text{AU}$. We modify previous algorithms and quantify the limitations of the method, recovering distances with uncertainties as low as the $\sim1.3\%$ level for more nearby objects ($\lesssim$ 0.3 AU) assuming typical astrometric uncertainties. We then acquire our own observations of two asteroids within a single night with $\sim0.1''$ uncertainties on RA, and we find we are able to recover distances to the $3\%$ level. We forecast likely scenarios with the VRO and the Argus Array with varying levels of astrometric precision and expected pointings per night. Our analysis indicates that distances to NEOs on the scale of $\sim0.5$ AU can be constrained to below the percent level within a single night, depending on spacing of observations from one observatory. In a follow-up paper, we will compare these constraints with synchronous and asynchronous observations from two separate observatories to measure parallax even more efficiently, an exciting and likely possibility over the upcoming decade.</description>

      <title>Searching for Hot Water World Candidates with CHEOPS: Refining the radii and analysing the internal structures and atmospheric lifetimes of TOI-238 b and TOI-1685 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the composition of exoplanets is one of the most promising approaches to observationally constrain planet formation and evolution processes. However, this endeavour is complicated for small exoplanets by the fact that a wide range of compositions is compatible with their bulk properties. To overcome this issue, we identify triangular regions in the mass-radius space where part of this degeneracy is lifted for close-in planets, since low-mass H/He envelopes would not be stable due to high-energy stellar irradiation. Planets in these Hot Water World triangles need to contain at least some heavier volatiles and are therefore interesting targets for atmospheric follow-up observations. We perform a demographic study to show that only few well-characterised planets in these regions are currently known and introduce our CHEOPS GTO programme aimed at identifying more of these potential hot water worlds. Here, we present CHEOPS observations for the first two targets of our programme, TOI-238 b and TOI-1685 b. Combined with TESS photometry and published RVs, we use the precise radii and masses of both planets to study their location relative to the corresponding Hot Water World triangles, perform an interior structure analysis and study the lifetimes of H/He and water-dominated atmospheres under these conditions. We find that TOI-238 b lies, at the 1-sigma level, inside the corresponding triangle. While a pure H/He atmosphere would have evaporated after 0.4-1.3 Myr, it is likely that a water-dominated atmosphere would have survived until the current age of the system, which makes TOI-238 b a promising hot water world candidate. Conversely, TOI-1685 b lies below the mass-radius model for a pure silicate planet, meaning that even though a water-dominated atmosphere would be compatible both with our internal structure and evaporation analysis, we cannot rule out the planet to be a bare core.</description>

      <title>In-depth characterization of the Kepler-10 three-planet system with HARPS-N RVs and Kepler TTVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The old G3V star Kepler-10 is known to host two transiting planets, the ultra-short-period super-Earth Kepler-10b ($P=0.837$ d; $R_{\rm p}=1.47~\rm R_\oplus$) and the long-period sub-Neptune Kepler-10c ($P=45.294$ d; $R_{\rm p}=2.35~\rm R_\oplus$), and a non-transiting planet causing variations in the Kepler-10c transit times. Measurements of the mass of Kepler-10c in the literature have shown disagreement, depending on the radial-velocity dataset and/or the modeling technique used. Here we report on the analysis of almost 300 high-precision radial velocities gathered with the HARPS-N spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo over $\sim11$~years, and extracted with the YARARA-v2 tool correcting for possible systematics and/or low-level activity variations at the spectrum level. To model these radial velocities, we used three different noise models and various numerical techniques, which all converged to the solution: $M_{\rm p, b}=3.24 \pm 0.32~\rm M_\oplus$ (10$\sigma$) and $\rho_{\rm p, b}=5.54 \pm 0.64~\rm g\;cm^{-3}$ for planet b; $M_{\rm p, c}=11.29 \pm 1.24~\rm M_\oplus$ (9$\sigma$) and $\rho_{\rm p, c}=4.75 \pm 0.53~\rm g\;cm^{-3}$ for planet c; and $M_{\rm p, d}\sin{i}=12.00 \pm 2.15~\rm M_\oplus$ (6$\sigma$) and $P=151.06 \pm 0.48$ d for the non-transiting planet Kepler-10d. This solution is further supported by the analysis of the Kepler-10c transit timing variations and their simultaneous modeling with the HARPS-N radial velocities. While Kepler-10b is consistent with a rocky composition and a small or no iron core, Kepler-10c may be a water world that formed beyond the water snowline and subsequently migrated inward.</description>

      <title>Impact of accretor size on the morphology of supersonic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast-moving accretors are ubiquitous in astrophysics. Their interaction with surrounding gas leaves characteristic imprints, forming structures like bow shocks, Mach cones, and density trails. We study how various physical processes affect the flow structure around an accretor with a one-way surface, its accretion rate, and accretion anisotropy. These processes correspond to distinct length scales: the Bondi radius, the bow shock's stand-off distance, and the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We conducted adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations using a spherical coordinate grid centred on the accretor. By varying the accretor's (numerical) size across scales -- from much smaller than the stand-off distance to much larger than the Bondi radius -- we analyse how these spatial scales affect steady-state flow physics. All simulations reach a steady state. When the accretor is smaller than the stand-off distance, a bow shock forms ahead, and a nearly spherically symmetric atmosphere develops within. Accretors smaller than the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius produce a Mach cone, while larger ones exhibit a supersonic-to-subsonic flow transition on larger scales. Fully resolved simulations align with Hoyle-Lyttleton theory, showing slightly anisotropic accretion with enhanced inflow from behind. In contrast, larger accretors approach the geometrical limit, accreting mainly from the flow direction, with a low-density 'shadow' forming behind. The accretor's size strongly influences small- and large-scale morphologies. Resolving the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius is essential for capturing large-scale flow characteristics. Resolving the stand-off distance is needed only to study the bow shock: since it determines the shock's position, its non-resolution does not affect large-scale flow morphology.</description>

      <title>Secondary ionisation in hot atmospheres and interactions between planetary and stellar winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The loss of close-in planetary atmospheres is influenced by various physical processes, such as photoionisation, which could potentially affect the atmosphere survivability on a secular timescale. The amount of stellar radiation converted into heat depends on the energy of the primary electrons produced by photoionisation and the local ionisation fraction. The Lyman-alpha line is an excellent probe for atmospheric escape. We study the interaction between the planetary and the stellar wind, the difference of the predicted mass-loss rates between 1D and 2D models, the signal of Ly-a and the impact of stellar flares. Using the PLUTO code, we perform 2D hydrodynamics simulations for four different planets. We consider planets in the size range from Neptune to Jupiter. We produce synthetic Ly-a profiles to comprehend the origin of the signal, and in particular its high velocity Doppler shift. Our results indicate a trend similar to the 1D models, with a decrease in the planetary mass-loss rate for all systems when secondary ionisation is taken into account. The mass-loss rates are found to decrease by 48% for the least massive planet when secondary ionisation is accounted for. We find nevertheless a decrease that is less pronounced in 2D than in 1D. We observe differences in the Ly-a profile between the different cases and significant asymmetries in all of them, especially for the lower mass planets. Finally, we observe that stellar flares do not affect the mass-loss rate because they act, in general, on a timescale that is too short. We find velocities in the escaping atmosphere up to 100 km/s, with the gas moving away from the star, which could be the result of the interaction with the stellar wind. Furthermore, we find that stellar flares generally occur on a timescale that is too short to have a visible impact on the mass-loss rate of the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Physically motivated analytic model of energy efficiency for EUV-driven atmospheric escape of close-in exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) driven atmospheric escape is a key process in the atmospheric evolution of close-in exoplanets. In many evolutionary models, the energy-limited mass-loss rate with a constant efficiency (typically $\sim10\%$) is assumed for calculating the mass-loss rate. However, hydrodynamic simulations have demonstrated that this efficiency depends on various stellar and planetary parameters. Comprehending the underlying physics of the efficiency is essential for understanding planetary atmospheric evolution and recent observations of the upper atmosphere of close-in exoplanets. We introduce relevant temperatures and timescales derived from physical principles to elucidate the mass-loss process. Our analytical mass-loss model is based on phenomenology and consistent across a range of planetary parameters. We compare our mass-loss efficiency and the radiation hydrodynamic simulations. The model can predict efficiency in both energy-limited and recombination-limited regimes. We further apply our model to exoplanets observed with hydrogen absorption (Ly$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$). Our findings suggest that Ly$\alpha$ absorption is detectable in planets subjected to intermediate EUV flux; under these conditions, the escaping outflow is insufficient in low-EUV environments, while the photoionization timescale remains short in high-EUV ranges. Conversely, H$\alpha$ absorption is detectable under high EUV flux conditions, facilitated by the intense Ly$\alpha$ flux exciting hydrogen atoms. According to our model, the non-detection of neutral hydrogen can be explained by a low mass-loss rate and is not necessarily due to stellar wind confinement or the absence of a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere in many cases. This model assists in identifying future observational targets and explicates the unusual absorption detection/non-detection patterns observed in recent studies.</description>

      <title>Recovering the structure of debris disks non-parametrically from images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris disks common around Sun-like stars carry dynamical imprints in their structure that are key to understanding the formation and evolution history of planetary systems. In this paper, we extend an algorithm (rave) originally developed to model edge-on disks to be applicable to disks at all inclinations. The updated algorithm allows for non-parametric recovery of the underlying (i.e., deconvolved) radial profile and vertical height of optically thin, axisymmetric disks imaged in either thermal emission or scattered light. Application to simulated images demonstrates that the de-projection and deconvolution performance allows for accurate recovery of features comparable to or larger than the beam or PSF size, with realistic uncertainties that are independent of model assumptions. We apply our method to recover the radial profile and vertical height of a sample of 18 inclined debris disks observed with ALMA. Our recovered structures largely agree with those fitted with an alternative visibility-space de-projection and deconvolution method (frank). We find that for disks in the sample with a well-defined main belt, the belt radius, fractional width and fractional outer edge width all tend to increase with age, but do not correlate in a clear or monotonic way with dust mass or stellar temperature. In contrast, the scale height aspect ratio does not strongly correlate with age, but broadly increases with stellar temperature. These trends could reflect a combination of intrinsic collisional evolution in the disk and the interaction of perturbing planets with the disk's own gravity.</description>

      <title>Endurance Science Workshop 2023 Final Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Endurance is a mission concept to explore and ultimately return samples from the Moon's largest and oldest impact basin, South Pole-Aitken (SPA). SPA holds the answers to many outstanding planetary science questions, including the earliest impact bombardment of the Solar System and the evolution of the Moon's interior. Endurance would address these questions by traversing 2,000 kilometers across the lunar farside, collecting samples, and delivering those samples to Artemis astronauts for return to Earth. Endurance was identified as the highest priority strategic mission for NASA's Lunar Discovery and Program in the recent Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey. This report summarizes the results from the first public workshop about the concept. Major findings include: (1) Endurance is an exciting concept that would address long-standing, high-priority lunar and planetary science questions, and the community is ready for it. (2) Endurance's sample science objectives are achievable, although they would require coordinated analysis techniques and numerous diverse samples. (3) Geologic context is essential for addressing Endurance's science objectives. (4) While Endurance's objectives center on sample return, Endurance's long traverse would enable a variety of additional transformative science investigations. (5) Endurance is an ambitious mission that would be enabled and enhanced by investing in developing key technologies now. (6) Endurance should strive to include more diverse perspectives in its formulation, particularly from early-career scientists and engineers who will ultimately operate the rover and analyze the samples. Endurance is early in its formulation and the next major activity will be a Science Definition Team (SDT). It is expected that this report and the findings therein may be useful input to the Endurance SDT.</description>

Abstract: The methylidyne cation (CH$^+$) and the methyl cation (CH$_3^+$) are building blocks of organic molecules, yet their coupled formation and excitation mechanisms remain mainly unprobed. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and good spectral resolution, provides unique access to the detection of these molecules. Our goal is to use the first detection of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in the protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe their formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical conditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS instruments to study the CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ spatial distribution at very small scales, and compare it to excited H$_2$ emission. CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ emissions originate from the same region as highly excited H$_2$. Our comparison between the Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ excitation and/or formation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of the observed CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational lines is around $T$ ~ 1500 K in the Bar and $T$ ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived from the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH$^+$) and expected (CH$_3^+$) column densities. These results show that CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH$^+$ rovibrational emission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H$_2$ via C$^+$ + H$_2^*$ = CH$^+$ + H. These results support a gas phase formation pathway of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions. However, we do not find any evidence of CH$_2^+$ emission in the JWST spectrum. Finally, observed CH$^+$ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping model provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.</description>

      <title>Exo-MerCat v2.0.0: updates and open-source release of the Exoplanet Merged Catalog software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet research is at the forefront of contemporary astronomy recommendations. As more and more exoplanets are discovered and vetted, databases and catalogs are built to collect information. Various resources are available to scientists for this purpose, though every one of them has different scopes and notations. In Alei et al. (2020) we described Exo-MerCat, a script that collects information from multiple sources and creates a homogenized table. In this manuscript, we announce the release of the Exo-MerCat v2.0.0 script as an upgraded, tested, documented and open-source software to produce catalogs. The main upgrades on the script concern: 1) the addition of the TESS Input Catalog and the K2 Input Catalog as input sources; 2) the optimization of the main identifier queries; 3) a more complex merging of the entries from the input sources into the final catalog; 4) some quality-of-life improvements such as informative flags, more user-friendly column headers, and log files; 5) the refactoring of the code in modules. We compare the performance of Exo-MerCat v2.0.0 with the previous version and notice a substantial improvement in the completeness of the sample, thanks to the addition of new input sources, and its accuracy, because of the optimization of the script.</description>

      <title>Discovering Numerous Interstellar Objects with A Dedicated Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08478</link>

Abstract: I show that a dedicated space telescope with a meter-size aperture can detect numerous interstellar objects, 10-m in diameter, that pass within ~20 degrees from the Sun. Separating the emitted thermal radiation from the reflection of sunlight would allow to measure the surface temperature, area and albedo of these objects. Spectroscopic observations of any evaporated material at the expected temperature of ~600K would provide important clues about the nature and birth sites of interstellar objects.</description>

      <title>The SPIRou Legacy Survey: near-infrared and optical radial velocity analysis of Gl 480 and Gl 382 using SPIRou, HARPS and CARMENES spectrographs</title>

Abstract: Context: Advancements in the field of exoplanetary research have extended radial velocity (RV) observations from the optical to the near-infrared (nIR) domain. M dwarf stars, characterized by their lower masses and higher prevalence of rocky planets, have become a focal point of investigation. This study uses data from the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou and data available in the literature from the HARPS and CARMENES spectrographs operating in the optical to analyze RVs of two nearby M dwarfs, Gl 480 and Gl 382.
  Aims: This work aims to detect and characterize exoplanetary companions around Gl 480 and Gl 382 by mitigating stellar activity effects through advanced data analysis techniques. The study seeks to improve the reliability of RV signals by integrating multi-wavelength observations and stellar activity diagnostics.
  Methods: The study employs a comprehensive approach that combines the line-by-line (LBL) framework with the Wapiti (Weighted principAl comPonent analysIs reconsTructIon) method to correct for systematics in SPIRou data. Through an extensive analysis of available stellar activity indicators and by combining optical data from the HARPS and CARMENES instruments, we perform a joint analysis of RV measurements in both the nIR and optical domains.
  Results: Our analysis confirms the detection of a planet orbiting Gl 480 with a period of $9.5537 \pm 0.0005$ d and a minimum mass of $8.8 \pm 0.7$ M$_\oplus$. Additionally, we detect a tentative signal at 6.4 d, whose significance depends strongly on the choice of Gaussian Process priors constrained by stellar activity indicators and would require further observations for confirmation. In contrast, no planetary signals are detected for Gl 382, where RV variations are dominated by stellar activity.</description>
