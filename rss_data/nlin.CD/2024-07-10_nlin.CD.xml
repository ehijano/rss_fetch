      <title>Graph Permutation Entropy: Extensions to the Continuous Case, A step towards Ordinal Deep Learning, and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics play an important role in the analysis of signals. A popular, readily interpretable nonlinear measure is Permutation Entropy. It has recently been extended for the analysis of graph signals, thus providing a framework for non-linear analysis of data sampled on irregular domains. Here, we introduce a continuous version of Permutation Entropy, extend it to the graph domain, and develop a ordinal activation function akin to the one of neural networks. This is a step towards Ordinal Deep Learning, a potentially effective and very recently posited concept. We also formally extend ordinal contrasts to the graph domain. Continuous versions of ordinal contrasts of length 3 are also introduced and their advantage is shown in experiments. We also integrate specific contrasts for the analysis of images and show that it generalizes well to the graph domain allowing a representation of images, represented as graph signals, in a plane similar to the entropy-complexity one. Applications to synthetic data, including fractal patterns and popular non-linear maps, and real-life MRI data show the validity of these novel extensions and potential benefits over the state of the art. By extending very recent concepts related to permutation entropy to the graph domain, we expect to accelerate the development of more graph-based entropy methods to enable nonlinear analysis of a broader kind of data and establishing relationships with emerging ideas in data science.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Spheres in Stringy Matrix Models: Quantifying Chaos in a Mixed Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a truncation of the BMN matrix model to a configuration of two fuzzy spheres, described by two coupled non-linear oscillators dependent on the mass parameter $\mu$. The classical phase diagram of the system generically ($\mu \neq 0$) contains three equilibrium points: two centers and a center-saddle; as $\mu \to 0$ the system exhibits a pitchfork bifurcation. We demonstrate that the system is exactly integrable in quadratures for $\mu=0$, while for very large values of $\mu$, it approaches another integrable point characterized by two harmonic oscillators. The classical phase space is mixed, containing both integrable islands and chaotic regions, as evidenced by the classical Lyapunov spectrum. At the quantum level, we explore indicators of early and late time chaos. The eigenvalue spacing is best described by a Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner distributions; it dovetails, at the quantum level, the classical results and reemphasizes the notion that the quantum system is mixed. We also study the spectral form factor and the quantum Lyapunov exponent, as defined by out-of-time-ordered correlators. These two indicators of quantum chaos exhibit weak correlations with the Brody distribution. We speculate that the behavior of the system as $\mu \to 0$ dominates the spectral form factor and the quantum Lyapunov exponent, making these indicators of quantum chaos less effective in the context of a mixed phase space.</description>

      <title>Krylov fractality and complexity in generic random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov space methods provide an efficient framework for analyzing the dynamical aspects of quantum systems, with tridiagonal matrices playing a key role. Despite their importance, the behavior of such matrices from chaotic to integrable states, transitioning through an intermediate phase, remains unexplored. We aim to fill this gap by considering the properties of the tridiagonal matrix elements and the associated basis vectors for appropriate random matrix ensembles. We utilize the Rosenzweig-Porter model as our primary example, which hosts a fractal regime in addition to the ergodic and localized phases. We discuss the characteristics of the matrix elements and basis vectors across the three (ergodic, fractal, and localized) regimes and introduce tools to identify the transition points. The exact expressions of the Lanczos coefficients are provided in terms of $q$-logarithmic function across the full parameter regime. The numerical results are corroborated with analytical reasoning for certain features of the Krylov spectra. Additionally, we investigate the Krylov state complexity within these regimes, showcasing the efficacy of our methods in pinpointing these transitions.</description>

      <title>On the origin of escort distributions for q-entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an argument about the origin of escort distributions used in conjunction with the q-entropy in non-additive thermo-statistics. The origin of the escort distributions is ascribed to the fact that the effective statistical description of the underlying system is provided by the measured Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of manifolds having a warped product metric structure. We interpret the entropic parameter \ q \ appearing in escort distributions as a "dimension" related to the fibration structure of the underlying phase spaces.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian for 1/1 Rotational Secondary Resonances, and Application to Small Satellites of Saturn and Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of rotation of the small satellites Methone and Aegaeon and revisit previous works on the rotation of Prometheus, Metis, and Amalthea. In all cases, the surfaces of section computed with the standard spin-orbit model reveal that the synchronous regime with small amplitude of libration shares another large domain in the phase space. We reproduce and apply the hamiltonian theory given in Wisdom (2004) to analytically characterize the detected structure as being a secondary resonance where the period of oscillation of the physical libration is similar to the orbital period of the satellite. We also show that the amplitude of libration around the secondary resonance is always larger than in the case of the other mode. Since the current rotational states of these sorts of satellites should be synchronous, our results can be considered in evolutionary studies of their rotation.</description>
