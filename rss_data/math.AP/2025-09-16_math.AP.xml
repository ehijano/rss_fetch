      <title>Simultaneous determination of wave speed, diffusivity and nonlinearity in the Westervelt equation using complex time-periodic solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem governed by the Westervelt equation with linear diffusivity and quadratic-type nonlinearity. The objective of this problem is to recover all the coefficients of this nonlinear partial differential equation. We show that, by constructing complex-valued time-periodic solutions excited from the boundary time-harmonically at a sufficiently high frequency, knowledge of the first- and second-harmonic Cauchy data at the boundary is sufficient to simultaneously determine the wave speed, diffusivity and nonlinearity in the interior of the domain of interest.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov estimates for polynomial operators by determinant majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain estimates on the supremum, infimum and oscillation of solutions for a wide class of inhomogeneous fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Euclidean domains where the differential operator is an I-central Garding-Dirichlet operator in the sense of Harvey-Lawson (2024). The argument combines two recent results: an Alexandrov estimate of Payne-Redaelli (2025) for locally semiconvex functions based on the area formula and a determinant majorization estimate of Harvey-Lawson (2024).
  The determinant majorization estimate has as a special case the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality, so the result includes the classical Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate for linear operators. A potential theoretic approach is used involving subequation subharmonics and their dual subharmonics. Semiconvex approximation plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Direct reconstruction of anisotropic self-adjoint inclusions in the Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the monotonicity method for direct exact reconstruction of inclusions in the partial data Calder\'on problem, to the case of anisotropic conductivities in any spatial dimension $d\geq 2$. Specifically, from a local Neumann-to-Dirichlet map, we give reconstruction methods of inclusions based on unknown anisotropic self-adjoint perturbations to a known anisotropic conductivity coefficient. A main assumption is a definiteness condition for the perturbations near the outer inclusion boundaries. This additionally provides new insights into the non-uniqueness issues of the anisotropic Calder\'on problem.</description>

      <title>The concentration-compactness principle for Musielak-Orlicz spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the Concentration-Compactness Principle to Musielak-Orlicz spaces, working in both bounded and unbounded domains. We show that our results include important special cases like classical Orlicz spaces, variable exponent spaces, double phase spaces, and a new type of double phase problem where the exponents depend on the solution. Using these general results with variational methods, we prove that certain quasilinear equations with critical nonlinear terms have solutions.</description>

      <title>Approximation in an optimal design problem governed by the heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a two-material optimal design problem for the time-averaged duality pairing between a (possibly time-dependent) heat source and the weak solution of an initial-boundary value problem for the heat equation with a two-material diffusion coefficient, under a volume constraint. In general, such optimal designs are not guaranteed to exist, and geometric constraints such as the perimeter are required. As an approximation of the problem with an additional perimeter constraint, a material representation based on a level set function, together with a perturbation of the Dirichlet energy, is employed. It is then shown that optimal level set functions exist for the perturbation problem, and the corresponding minimum value converges to that of the elliptic case, thereby elucidating the long-time behavior. Furthermore, two-material domains satisfying this property are also constructed via the nonlinear diffusion-based level set method. In particular, the asymptotic behavior with respect to the perturbation parameter is clarified, and the validity of the approximation is established.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Dynamics of the 3D Vlasov-Maxwell System with Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct global-in-time classical solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell system in a three-dimensional half-space beyond the vacuum scattering regime. Our approach combines the construction of stationary solutions to the associated boundary-value problem with a proof of their asymptotic dynamical stability in $L^\infty$ under small perturbations, providing a new framework for understanding long-time wave-particle interactions in the presence of boundaries and interacting magnetic fields. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first construction of asymptotically stable non-vacuum steady states under general perturbations in the full three-dimensional nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell system.</description>

      <title>A new proof on quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with prescribed mass and combined nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} \aligned -\Delta u-\Delta(u^2)u=|u|^{p-2}u+|u|^{q-2}u+\lambda u,\,\, x\in\R^N, \endaligned \end{equation*} under the mass constraint \begin{equation*} \int_{\R^N}|u|^2\text{d}x=a, \end{equation*} where $N\geq2$, $2&lt;p&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;4+\frac{4}{N}&lt;q&lt;22^*$, $a&gt;0$ is a given mass and $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier. As a continuation of our previous work (Chen et al., 2025, arXiv:2506.07346v1), we establish some results by means of a suitable change of variables as follows:
  \begin{itemize} \item[{\bf(i) }] {\bf qualitative analysis of the constrained minimization}\\ For $2&lt;p&lt;4+\frac{4}{N}\leq q&lt;22^*$, we provide a detailed study of the minimization problem under some appropriate conditions on $a&gt;0$;
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{itemize} \item[{\bf(ii)}]{\bf existence of two radial distinct normalized solutions}\\ For $2&lt;p&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;4+\frac{4}{N}&lt;q&lt;22^*$, we obtain a local minimizer under the normalized constraint;\\ For $2&lt;p&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;4+\frac{4}{N}&lt;q\leq2^*$, we obtain a mountain pass type normalized solution distinct from the local minimizer.
  \end{itemize} Notably, the second result {\bf (ii)} resolves the open problem {\bf(OP1)} posed by (Chen et al., 2025, arXiv:2506.07346v1). Unlike previous approaches that rely on constructing Palais-Smale-Pohozaev sequences by [Jeanjean, 1997, Nonlinear Anal. {\bf 28}, 1633-1659], we obtain the mountain pass solution employing a new method, which lean upon the monotonicity trick developed by (Chang et al., 2024, Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'{e} C Anal. Non Lin\'{e}aire, {\bf 41}, 933-959).
  We emphasize that the methods developed in this work can be extended to investigate the existence of mountain pass-type normalized solutions for other classes of quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations.</description>

      <title>Sketches of Nonuniformly Elliptic Schauder Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schauder theory is a basic tool in the study of elliptic and parabolic PDEs, asserting that solutions inherit the regularity of the coefficients. It plays a central role in establishing higher regularity for solutions to a broad class of elliptic problems exhibiting ellipticity, including those involving free boundaries. In the linear setting, Schauder theory dates back to the 1920-30s and is now considered classical. Nonlinear extensions were developed in the 1980s. All these classical results are restricted to uniformly elliptic operators and heavily rely on perturbative techniques - freezing the coefficients and comparing the solution to that of a constant-coefficient problem. However, such methods fail in the nonuniformly elliptic setting, where homogeneous a priori estimates break down and standard iteration arguments no longer apply. Here we give a brief survey on recent progresses including the solution to the longstanding problem of proving the validity of Schauder estimates in the nonlinear, nonuniformly elliptic setting.</description>

      <title>Construction of solutions for a critical elliptic system of Hamiltonian type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following nonlinear elliptic system of Hamiltonian type with critical exponents: \begin{equation*}\left\{\begin{align*}
  -\Delta u + V(|y'|,y'') u = v^p, \;\; \text{in} \;\; \mathbb{R}^N,\\
  -\Delta v + V(|y'|,y'') v = u^q, \;\; \text{in} \;\; \mathbb{R}^N,\\
  u, v &gt; 0 , (u,v) \in (\dot{W}^{2,\frac{p+1}{p}} (\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)) \times (\dot{W}^{2,\frac{q+1}{q}} (\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)) ,\end{align*}\right. \end{equation*} where $(y', y'') \in \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^{N-2}$ and $V(|y'|, y'')\not\equiv 0$ is a bounded non-negative function in $\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{R}^{N-2}$, $p,q&gt;1$ satisfying $$\frac{1}{p+1}+\frac{1}{q+1}=\frac{N-2}{N}.$$ By using a finite reduction argument and local Pohozaev identities, under the assumption that $N\geq 5$, $(p,q)$ lies in the certain range and $r^2V(r,y'')$ has a stable critical point, we prove that the above problem has infinitely many solutions whose energy can be made arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Global Strong Solutions to the Three-Dimensional Axisymmetric Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Large Initial Data and Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the three-dimensional axisymmetric compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary conditions in a cylindrical domain that excludes the axis. For initial density allowed to vanish, the global existence and large time asymptotic behavior of strong and weak solutions are established, provided the shear viscosity is a positive constant and the bulk one is a power function of density with the power bigger than four-thirds. It should be noted that this result is obtained without any restrictions on the size of initial data.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions to a conformally invariant elliptic equation with Choquard-type nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of an unbounded sequence of solutions to a conformally invariant elliptic equation having nonlocal critical-power nonlinearity is established. The primary obstacle to establishing existence of solutions is the failure of compactness in the Sobolev embedding. To overcome this obstacle, the problem under consideration is lifted to an equivalent problem on the standard sphere so that the symmetries of the sphere can be leveraged. Two classes of symmetries are considered and for each class of symmetries, an unbounded sequence of solutions to the lifted problem with the prescribed symmetries is produced. One class of symmetries always exists and the corresponding solutions are guaranteed to be sign-changing whenever a suitable relationship between the dimension and the nonlocality parameter holds. The other class of symmetries need not always exist but when it exists, the corresponding solutions are guaranteed to be sign-changing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the regularity of solutions and structural properties of the free boundary for a class of fourth-order elliptic problems with Neumann-type boundary conditions. The singular and degenerate elliptic operators studied naturally emerge from the extension procedure for higher-order fractional powers of the Laplacian, while the choice of non-linearity considered encompasses two-phase boundary obstacle problems as a special case. After establishing local regularity properties of solutions, Almgren- and Monneau-type monotonicity formulas are derived and utilized to carry out a blow-up analysis and prove a stratification result for the free boundary.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence in the sense of sequences of solutions for some integro-differential type problems involving the drift term and the square of the Laplace operator, on the whole real line or on a finite interval with periodic boundary conditions in the corresponding H^4 spaces. Our argument is based on the fixed point technique when the elliptic equations contain fourth order differential operators with and without the Fredholm property. It is established that, under the reasonable technical conditions, the convergence in L^1 of the integral kernels yields the existence and convergence in H^4 of the solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the location of the spreading front and convergence to traveling wave profile of solutions to the Fisher-KPP equation in the following two cases: (i) in unbounded domains with an expanding boundary; (ii) on the real line where the environment function has a shifting jump discontinuity. Our approach is based on extending ideas in Bramson's seminal work in 1983, and applying gluing technique to construct super/subsolutions.</description>

      <title>Random data Cauchy theory for fully nonlocal telegraph equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the random Cauchy problem for the fully nonlocal telegraph equation of power type with the general $(\mathcal{PC}^{\ast})$ type kernel $(a,b)$. This equation can effectively characterize high-frequency signal transmission in small-scale systems. We establish a new completely positive kernel induced by $b$ (see Appendix \refeq{app b}) and derive two novel solution operators by using the relaxation functions associated with the new kernel,which are closely related to the operators $\cos(\theta(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{4}} )$ and $(-\Delta)^{-\frac{\beta}{4} }\sin(\theta(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{4}} )$ for $\beta\in(1,2]$. These operators enable, for the first time, the derivation of mixed-norm $L_t^qL_x^{p'}$ estimates for the novel solution operators. Next, utilizing probabilistic randomization methods, we establish the average effects, the local existence and uniqueness for a large set of initial data $u^\omega \in L^{2}(\Omega, H^{s,p}(\mathbb R^3))$ ($p\in (1,2)$) while also obtaining probabilistic estimates for local existence under randomized initial conditions. The results reveal a critical phenomenon in the temporal regularity of the solution regarding the regularity index $s$ of the initial data $u^\omega$.</description>

Abstract: This survey is a chapter of a forthcoming book. This chapter recalls the classical formulation of the Div-Curl lemma along with its proof, and presents some possible generalizations in the fractional setting, within the framework of the Riesz fractional gradient and divergence introduced by Shieh and Spector (2015) and further developed by Comi and Stefani (2019).</description>

      <title>A nonlinear model for long-range segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of fully nonlinear elliptic equations, depending on a small parameter $\eps$, that models long-range segregation of populations. The diffusion is governed by the negative Pucci operator. In the linear case, this system was previously investigated by Caffarelli, the second author, and Quitalo in \cite{CL2} as a model in population dynamics. We establish the existence of solutions and prove convergence as $\eps\to0^+$ to a free boundary problem in which populations remain segregated at a positive distance. In addition, we show that the supports of the limiting functions are sets of finite perimeter and satisfy a semi-convexity property.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamically consistent model for bulk-surface viscous fluid mixtures: Model derivation and mathematical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and analyze a new diffuse interface model for incompressible, viscous fluid mixtures with bulk-surface interaction. Our system consists of a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model in the bulk that is coupled to a surface Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model on the boundary. Compared with previous models, the inclusion of an additional surface Navier--Stokes equation is motivated, for example, by biological applications such as the seminal \textit{fluid mosaic model} (Singer \&amp; Nicolson, \textit{Science}, 1972) in which the surface of biological cells is interpreted as a thin layer of viscous fluids. We derive our new model by means of local mass balance laws, local energy dissipation laws, and the Lagrange multiplier approach. Moreover, we prove the existence of global weak solutions via a semi-Galerkin discretization. The core part of the mathematical analysis is the study of a novel bulk-surface Stokes system and its corresponding bulk-surface Stokes operator. Its eigenfunctions are used as the Galerkin basis to discretize the bulk-surface Navier--Stokes subsystem.</description>

      <title>Entire Large Solutions for Competitive Semilinear Elliptic Systems with General Nonlinearities Satisfying Keller--Osserman Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize a theorem of Lair concerning the existence of positive entire large solutions to competitive semilinear elliptic systems. While Lair's original result \cite{Lair2025} was established for power-type nonlinearities, our work extends the theory to a broad class of general nonlinearities satisfying a Keller--Osserman-type growth condition. The proof follows the same conceptual framework monotone iteration to construct global positive solutions, reduction to a scalar inequality for the sum of the components, application of a Keller--Osserman transform, and a two-step radial integration argument but replaces the explicit power-law growth with a general monotone envelope function. This approach yields a unified and verifiable criterion for the existence of large solutions in terms of the Keller--Osserman integral, thereby encompassing both critical and supercritical growth regimes within a single analytical setting.</description>

Abstract: In this survey we present the fractional Polya Szego principle and its main consequences in the study of nonlocal functional inequalities. In particular, we show how symmetrization methods work also in the fractional setting and yield sharp results such as isoperimetric type inequalities. Further developments including stability issues and generalizations in the anisotropic and the Gaussian setting are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the vanishing viscosity approximation of fully nonlinear, non-convex, second-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new quantitative estimates of the vanishing viscosity approximation for time-dependent, degenerate, Hamilton-Jacobi equations that are neither concave nor convex in the gradient and Hessian entries of the form $\partial_t u+H(x,t,Du,D^2u)=0$ in the whole space. We approximate the PDE with a fully nonlinear, possibly degenerate, elliptic operator $\varepsilon F(x,t,D^2u)$. Assuming that $u\in C^\alpha_x$, $u_0\in C^\eta$, $H\in C^\beta_x$ and having power growth $\gamma$ in the gradient entry, we establish a convergence rate of order $\varepsilon^{\min\left\{\frac{\eta}{2},\frac{\beta+\gamma(\alpha-1)}{\beta+\gamma(\alpha-1)+2-\alpha}\right\}}$. Our novel approach exploits the regularizing properties of sup/inf-convolutions for viscosity solutions and the comparison principle. We also obtain explicit constants and do not assume differentiability properties neither on solutions nor on $H$. The same method provides new convergence rates for the vanishing viscosity approximation of the stationary counterpart of the equation and for transport equations with H\"older coefficients.</description>

      <title>Conditional existence of maximizers for the Tomas-Stein inequality for the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tomas-Stein inequality for a compact subset $\Gamma$ of the sphere $S^d$ states that the mapping $f\mapsto \widehat{f\sigma}$ is bounded from $L^2(\Gamma,\sigma)$ to $L^{2+4/d}(\R^{d+1})$. Then conditional on a strict comparison between the best constants for the sphere and for the Strichartz inequality for the Schr\"odinger equations, we prove that there exist functions which extremize this inequality, and any extremising sequence has a subsequence which converges to an extremizer. The method is based on the refined Tomas-Stein inequality for the sphere and the profile decompositions. The key ingredient to establish orthogonality in profile decompositions is that we use Tao's sharp bilinear restriction theorem for the paraboloids beyond the Tomas-Stein range. Similar results have been previously established by Frank, Lieb and Sabin \cite{Frank-Lieb-Sabin:2007:maxi-sphere-2d}, where they used the method of the missing mass.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a mathematical analysis of time-dependent $N$-body electronic systems and establish mixed regularity for the corresponding wavefunctions. Based on this, we develop sparse grid approximations to reduce computational complexity, including a sparse grid Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) scheme. We validate the approach on the Helium atom (${\rm He}$) and Hydrogen molecule (${\rm H}_2$), showing that sparse grid GTOs offer an efficient alternative to full grid discretizations.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes Equations with Fractional Dissipation and Associated Doubly Stochastic Yule Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric regions are identified in terms of the spatial dimension $d$ and the power $\gamma$ of the Laplacian that separate explosive from non-explosive regimes for the self-similar doubly stochastic Yule cascades (DSY) naturally associated with the deterministic fractional Navier-Stokes equations (FNSE) on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the scaling-supercritical setting. Explosion and/or geometric properties of the DSY, are then used to establish non-uniqueness, local existence, and finite-time blow-up results for a scalar partial differential equation associated to the FNSE through a majorization principle at the level of stochastic solution processes. The solution processes themselves are constructed from the DSY and yield solutions to the FNSE upon taking expectations.
  In the special case $d=2$, a closed-form expression for the solution process of the FNSE is derived. This representation is employed to prove finite-time loss of integrability of the solution process for sufficiently large initial data. Notably, this lack of integrability does not necessarily imply blow-up of the FNSE solutions themselves. In fact, in the radially symmetric case, solutions can be continued beyond the integrability threshold by employing a modified notion of averaging.</description>

Abstract: We establish weak existence and uniqueness for random field solutions of the one-dimensional SPDE \[ d_tX_t = \frac{1}{2}\Delta X_t +h(X_t)+ \sqrt{X_t}\dot{W}, \quad t\geq 0,\] where $\dot{W}$ is space-time white noise and $h$ is a bounded drift with $h(0)\geq 0$. The proof relies on an extension of the duality relation of the super-Brownian motion, which allows us to treat a broad class of admissible drifts, including functions that are non-Lipschitz or discontinuous at zero.</description>

      <title>On the planar free elastic flow with small oscillation of curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free elastic flow that begins at any curve exists for all time. If the initial curve is an $\omega$-fold covered circle (``$\omega$-circle'') the solution expands self-similarly. Very recently, Miura and the second author showed that (topological) $\omega$-circles that are close to multiply-covered round circles are asymptotically stable under the planar free elastic flow, which means that upon rescaling the rescaled flow converges smoothly to the stationary (in the rescaled setting) $\omega$-circle. Closeness in that work was measured via the derivative of the curvature scalar. In the present paper, we improve this by requiring closeness in terms of the curvature scalar itself. The convergence rate we obtain is sharp.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of tangent planes and (non-)removable singularities at infinity for collapsed translators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that mean curvature flow translators may exhibit non-removable singularities at infinity, due to jump discontinuities in their asymptotic profiles, and that oscillation can persist so as to yield a continuum of subsequential limit tangent planes. Nonetheless, we prove that as time $t\to\pm \infty$, any finite entropy, finite genus, embedded, collapsed translating soliton in $\mathbb{R}^3$ converges to a uniquely determined collection of planes.
  This requires global analysis of quasilinear soliton equations with non-perturbative drifts, which we analyze via sharp non-standard elliptic decay estimates for the drift Laplacian, implying improvements on the Evans-Spruck and Ecker-Huisken estimates in the soliton setting, and exploiting a link from potential theory of the Yukawa equation to heat flows with $L^\infty$-data on non-compact slice curves of these solitons.
  The structure theorem follows: such solitons decompose at infinity into standard regions asymptotic to planes or grim reaper cylinders. As one application, we classify collapsed translators of entropy two with empty limits as $t\to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Second-Order Projection Method to Leray-Hopf Solutions of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a second-order projection method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on bounded Lipschitz domains. The scheme employs a Backward Differentiation Formula of order two (BDF2) for the time discretization, combined with conforming finite elements in space. Projection methods are widely used to enforce incompressibility, yet rigorous convergence results for possibly non-smooth solutions have so far been restricted to first-order schemes. We establish, for the first time, convergence (up to subsequence) of a second-order projection method to Leray-Hopf weak solutions under minimal assumptions on the data, namely $u_0 \in L^2_{\text{div}}(\Omega)$ and $f \in L^2(0,T;L^2_{\text{div}}(\Omega))$. Our analysis relies on two ingredients: A discrete energy inequality providing uniform $L^{\infty}(0,T;L^2(\Omega))$ and $L^2(0,T;H^1_0(\Omega))$ bounds for suitable interpolants of the discrete velocities, and a compactness argument combining Simon's theorem with refined time-continuity estimates. These tools overcome the difficulty that only the projected velocity satisfies an approximate divergence-free condition, while the intermediate velocity is controlled in space. We conclude that a subsequence of the approximations converges to a Leray-Hopf weak solution. This result provides the first rigorous convergence proof for a higher-order projection method under no additional assumptions on the solution beyond those following from the standard a priori energy estimate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a Lie symmetry analysis on the tempered-fractional Keller Segel (TFKS) system, a chemo-taxis model incorporating anomalous diffusion. A novel approach is used to handle the nonlocal nature of tempered fractional operators. By deriving the full set of Lie point symmetries and identifying the optimal one-dimensional subalgebras, we reduce the TFKS PDEs to ordinary differential equations (ODEs), yielding new exact solutions. These results offer insights into the long-term behavior and aggregation dynamics of the TFKS model and present a methodology applicable to other tempered fractional differential equations.</description>

      <title>A note on Tricomi-type partial differential equations with white noise initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of Tricomi-type partial differential equations previously investigated in [28]. Firstly, we generalize the representation formula for the solution obtained there by allowing the coefficient in front of the second-order partial derivative with respect to $x$ to be any non integer power of $t$. Then, we analyze the robustness of that solution by taking the initial data to be Gaussian white noise and we discover that the existence of a well-defined random field solution is lost upon the introduction of lower-order terms in the operator. This phenomenon shows that, even though the Tricomi-type operators with or without lower-order terms are the same from the point of view of the theory of hyperbolic operators with double characteristics, their corresponding random versions exhibit different well posedness properties. We also prove that for more regular initial data, specifically fractional Gaussian white noise with Hurst parameter $H\in (1/2,1)$, the well posedness of the Cauchy problem for the Tricomi-type operator with lower-order term is restored.</description>

      <title>X-ray imaging from nonlinear waves: numerical reconstruction of a cubic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an inverse boundary value problem for the nonlinear wave equation in $2 + 1$ dimensions. The objective is to recover an unknown potential $q(x, t)$ from the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map using real-valued waves. We propose a direct numerical reconstruction method for the Radon transform of $q$, which can then be inverted using standard X-ray tomography techniques to determine $q$. Our implementation introduces a spectral regularization procedure to stabilize the numerical differentiation step required in the reconstruction, improving robustness with respect to noise in the boundary data. We also give rigorous justification and stability estimates for the regularized spectral differentiation of noisy measurements. A direct pointwise reconstruction method for $q$ is also implemented for comparison. Numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of recovering potentials from boundary measurements of nonlinear waves and illustrate the advantages of the Radon-based reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Decision Modeling for Viable Short and Long Term Production Policies: An HJB Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a mathematical framework to investigate the viability and reachability of production systems under constraints. We develop a model that incorporates key decision variables, such as pricing policy, quality investment, and advertising, to analyze short-term tactical decisions and long-term strategic outcomes. In the short term, we constructed a capture basin that defined the initial conditions under which production viability constraints were satisfied within the target zone. In the long term, we explore the dynamics of product quality and market demand to achieve and sustain the desired target. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) theory characterizes the capture basin and viability kernel using viscosity solutions of the HJB equation. This approach, which avoids controllability assumptions, is well suited to viability problems with specified targets. It provides managers with insights into maintaining production and inventory levels within viable ranges while considering product quality and evolving market demand. We numerically studied the HJB equation to design and test computational methods that validate the theoretical insights. Simulations offer practical tools for decision-makers to address operational challenges while aligning with the long-term sustainability goals. This study enhances the production system performance and resilience by linking rigorous mathematics with actionable solutions.</description>

      <title>Finite energy well-posedness for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-vanishing conditions at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relevant physical phenomena are described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-vanishing conditions at infinity. This paper investigates the respective 2D and 3D Cauchy problems. Local well-posedness in the energy space for energy-subcritical nonlinearities, merely satisfying Kato-type assumptions, is proven, providing the analogue of the well-established local $H^1$-theory for solutions vanishing at infinity. The critical nonlinearity will be simply a byproduct of our analysis and the existing literature. Under an assumption that prevents the onset of a Benjamin-Feir type instability, global well-posedness in the energy space is proven for a) non-negative Hamiltonians, b) sign-indefinite Hamiltonians under additional assumptions on the zeros of the nonlinearity, c) generic nonlinearities and small initial data. The cases b) and c) only concern the 3D case</description>

Abstract: We derive the quantitative estimates of propagation of chaos for the large interacting particle systems in terms of the relative entropy between the joint law of the particles and the tensorized law of the mean field PDE. We resolve this problem for the first time for the viscous vortex model that approximates 2D Navier-Stokes equation in the vorticity formulation on the whole space. We obtain as key tools the Li-Yau-type estimates and Hamilton-type heat kernel estimates for 2D Navier-Stokes in the whole space.</description>

Abstract: We present regularity results for the crack set of a minimizer for the Griffith fracture energy, arising in the variational modeling of brittle materials. In the planar setting, we prove an epsilon-regularity theorem showing that the crack is locally a $C^{1,1/2}$ curve outside of a singular set of zero Hausdorff measure. The main novelty is that, in contrast to previous results, no topological constraints on the crack are required. The results also apply to almost-minimizers.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the energy-critical stochastic Hartree nonlinear wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the stochastic Hartree nonlinear wave equations (SHNLW) with a cubic convolution nonlinearity and an additive stochastic forcing on the Euclidean space. Our goal in this paper is two-fold. (i) We study the defocusing energy-critical SHNLW on $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d \geq 5$, and prove that they are globally well-posed with deterministic initial data in the energy space. (ii) Next, we consider the well-posedness of the defocusing energy-critical SHNLW with randomized initial data below the energy space. In particular, when $d=5$, we prove it is almost surely globally well-posed. As a byproduct, by removing the stochastic forcing our result covers the study of the (deterministic) Hartree nonlinear wave equation (HNLW) with randomized initial data below the energy space.
  The main ingredients in the globalization argument involve the probabilistic perturbation approach by B\'enyi-Oh-Pocovnicu (2015) and Pocovnicu (2017), time integration by parts trick of Oh-Pocovnicu (2016), and an estimate of the Hartree potential energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a strengthening of the usual quasiconvexity condition of Morrey in two dimensions, which allows us to prove lower semicontinuity for functionals which are unbounded as the determinant vanishes. This notion, that we call principal quasiconvexity, arose from the planar theory of quasiconformal mappings and mappings of finite distortion. We compare it with other quasiconvexity conditions that have appeared in the literature and provide a number of concrete examples of principally quasiconvex functionals that are not polyconvex. The Stoilow factorization, that in the context of maps of integrable distortion was developed by Iwaniec and \v{S}ver\'ak, plays a prominent role in our approach.</description>

Abstract: We broaden the domain of the Fourier transform to contain all distributions without using the Paley-Wiener theorem and devise a new weak formulation built upon this extension. This formulation is applicable to evolution equations involving pseudo-differential operators, even when the signs of their symbols may vary over time. Notably, our main operator includes the logarithmic Laplacian operator $\log (-\Delta)$ and a second-order differential operator whose leading coefficients are not positive semi-definite.</description>

      <title>On the critical behavior for the semilinear biharmonic heat equation with forcing term in an exterior domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the critical behavior of solutions to the semilinear biharmonic heat equation with forcing term $f(x),$ under six homogeneous boundary conditions. This paper is the first since the seminal work by Bandle, Levine, and Zhang [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 251 (2000) 624-648], to focus on the study of critical exponents in exterior problems for semilinear parabolic equations with a forcing term. By employing a method of test functions and comparison principle, we derive the critical exponents $p_{Crit}$ in the sense of Fujita. Moreover, we show that $p_{Crit}=\infty$ if $N=2,3,4$ and $p_{Crit}=\frac{N}{N-4}$ if $N \geq 5$. The impact of the forcing term on the critical behavior of the problem is also of interest, and thus a second critical exponent in the sense of Lee-Ni, depending on the forcing term is introduced. We also discuss the case $f\equiv 0$, and present the finite-time blow-up results and lifespan estimates of solutions for the subcritical and critical cases. The lifespan estimates of solutions are obtained by employing the method proposed by Ikeda and Sobajama in [Nonlinear Anal. 182 (2019) 57-74].</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of 1-D evolution equations and their initial data from one passive measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study formally determined inverse problems with passive measurements for one dimensional evolution equations where the goal is to simultaneously determine both the initial data as well as the variable coefficients in such an equation from the measurement of its solution at a fixed spatial point for a certain amount of time. This can be considered as a one-dimensional model of widely open inverse problems in photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography. We provide global uniqueness results for wave and heat equations stated on bounded or unbounded spatial intervals. Contrary to all previous related results on the subject, we do not impose any genericity assumptions on the coefficients or initial data. Our proofs are based on creating suitable links to the well understood spectral theory for 1D Schr\"odinger operators. In particular, in the more challenging case of a bounded spatial domain, our proof for the inverse problem partly relies on the following two ingredients, namely (i) a Paley-Wiener type theorem for Schr\"odinger operators due to Remling \cite{Remling2002SchrdingerOA} and a theorem of Levinson \cite{Levinson1940} on distribution of zeros of entire functions of regular growth that together provide a quantifiable link between support of a compactly supported function and the upper density of its vanishing Schr\"odinger spectral modes and (ii) a result of Gesztesy and Simon \cite{Gesztesy1999InverseSA} on partial data inverse spectral problems for reconstructing an unknown potential in a 1D Schr\"odinger operator from the knowledge of only a fraction of its spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We develop regularity theory for degenerate elliptic equations with the degeneracy controlled by a weight. More precisely, we show local boundedness and continuity of weak solutions under the assumption of a weighted Orlicz-Sobolev and Poincar\'{e} inequalities. The proof relies on a modified DeGiorgi iteration scheme, developed in arXiv:1608.01630 and arXiv:1703.00774. The Orlicz-Sobolev inequality we assume here is much weaker than the classical $(2\sigma,2)$ Sobolev inequality with $\sigma&gt;1$ which is typically used in the DeGiorgi or Moser iteration.</description>

      <title>Stability of axial free-boundary hyperplanes in circular cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an axially-symmetric, $(n+1)$-dimensional convex cone $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, we study the stability of the free-boundary minimal surface $\Sigma$ obtained by intersecting $\Omega$ with a $n$-plane that contains the axis of $\Omega$. In the case $n=2$, $\Sigma$ is always unstable, as a special case of the vertex-skipping property that we recently proved in another article. Conversely, as soon as $n \ge 3$ and $\Omega$ has a sufficiently large aperture (depending on the dimension $n$), we show that $\Sigma$ is strictly stable. For our stability analysis, we introduce a Lipschitz flow $\Sigma_{t}[f]$ of deformations of $\Sigma$ associated with a compactly-supported, scalar deformation field $f$, which satisfies the key property $\partial \Sigma_{t}[f] \subset \partial \Omega$ for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$. Then, we compute the lower-right second variation of the area of $\Sigma$ along the flow, and ultimately show that it is positive by exploiting its connection with a functional inequality studied in the context of reaction-diffusion problems.</description>

  The onus of proof lies with the careful analysis of the ghost function, the gradient part in the Helmholtz-W\'eyl decomposition of a nonlinear flux that appears in the domain variation formula for $J(u)$.
  As an application we prove full regularity for a class of quasilinear Bernoulli type free boundary problems in $\R^3$.</description>

      <title>Rate-form equilibrium for an isotropic Cauchy-elastic formulation: Part I: modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the rate-form spatial equilibrium system for a nonlinear Cauchy elastic formulation in isotropic finite-strain elasticity. For a given explicit Cauchy stress-strain constitutive equation, we determine those properties that pertain to the appearing fourth-order stiffness tensor. Notably, we show that this stiffness tensor $\mathbb{H}^{\text{ZJ}}(\sigma)$ acting on the Zaremba-Jaumann stress rate is uniformly positive definite. We suggest a mathematical treatment of the ensuing spatial PDE-system which may ultimately lead to a local existence result, to be presented in part II of this work. As a preparatory step, we show existence and uniqueness of a subproblem based on Korn's first inequality and the positive definiteness of this stiffness tensor. The procedure is not confined to Cauchy elasticity, however in the Cauchy elastic case, most theoretical statements can be made explicit.
  Our development suggests that looking at the rate-form equations of given Cauchy-elastic models may provide additional insight to the modeling of nonlinear isotropic elasticity. This especially concerns constitutive requirements emanating from the rate-formulation, here being reflected by the positive definiteness of $\mathbb{H}^{\text{ZJ}}(\sigma)$.</description>

      <title>On the positive constant in Arnold's second stability theorem for a bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a steady flow of a two-dimensional ideal fluid, the gradient vectors of the stream function $\psi$ and its vorticity $\omega$ are collinear. Arnold's second stability theorem states that the flow is Lyapunov stable if $0&lt;\nabla\omega/\nabla\psi&lt;C_{ar}$ for some $C_{ar}&gt;0$. In this paper, we show that, for a bounded domain, $C_{ar}$ can be taken as the first eigenvalue $\bm\Lambda_1$ of a certain Laplacian eigenvalue problem. When $\nabla\omega/\nabla\psi$ reaches $\bm\Lambda_1$, instability may occur, as illustrated by a non-circular steady flow in a disk; however, a certain form of structural stability still holds. Based on these results, we establish a theorem on the rigidity and orbital stability of steady Euler flows in a disk.</description>

      <title>From Initial Data to Boundary Layers: Neural Networks for Nonlinear Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the approximation of entropy solutions to initial-boundary value problems for nonlinear strictly hyperbolic conservation laws using neural networks. A general and systematic framework is introduced for the design of efficient and reliable learning algorithms, combining fast convergence during training with accurate predictions. The methodology that relies on solving a certain relaxed related problem is assessed through a series of one-dimensional scalar test cases. These numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of the methodology developed in this paper and its applicability to more complex industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a parabolic-hyperbolic hybrid population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the global dynamics of a hybrid parabolic-hyperbolic model describing populations with distinct dispersal and sedentary stages. We first establish the global well-posedness of solutions, prove a comparison principle, and demonstrate the asymptotic smoothness of the solution semiflow. Through the spectral analysis of the linearized system, we derive and characterize the net reproductive rate $\mathcal{R}_{0}$. Furthermore, an explicit relationship between $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ and the principal eigenvalue of the linearized system is analyzed. Under appropriate monotonicity assumptions, we show that $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ serves as a threshold parameter that completely determines the stability of steady states of the system. More precisely, when $\mathcal{R}_{0}&lt;1$, the trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotical stable, while when $\mathcal{R}_{0}&gt;1$, the system is uniformly persistent and there is a positive equilibrium which is unique and globally asymptotical stable.</description>

      <title>The new observations about the parameter-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence results of solutions for the following Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system involving different potentials:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u+V(x)u-\lambda \phi u=f(u)&amp;\quad\text{in}~\mathbb R^3,
  -\Delta\phi=u^2&amp;\quad\text{in}~\mathbb R^3.
  \end{cases} \end{equation*}
  We first consider the case that the potential $V$ is positive and radial so that the mountain pass theorem could be implied. The other case is that the potential $V$ is coercive and sign-changing, which means that the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $-\Delta +V$ is allowed to be indefinite. To deal with this more difficult case, by a local linking argument and Morse theory, the system has a nontrivial solution. Furthermore, we also show the asymptotical behavior result of this solution. Additionally, the proofs rely on new observations regarding the solutions of the Poisson equation. As a main novelty with respect to corresponding results in \cite{MR4527586,MR3148130,MR2810583}, we only assume that $f$ satisfies the super-linear growth condition at the origin. We believe that the methodology developed here can be adapted to study related problems concerning the existence of solutions for Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>Strichartz and local smoothing estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger equations over fractal time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain Strichartz-type estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger operator $f \mapsto e^{it(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}} f$ over a time set $E$ of fractal dimension. To obtain those estimates capturing fractal nature of $E$, we employ the notions in the spirit of the Assouad dimension, such as, bounded Assouad characteristic and Assouad specturm. We also prove the estimate $$ \| e^{it(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}} f \|_{L_t^q(\mathrm{d}\mu; L_x^r(\mathbb{R}^d))} \le C \|f\|_{H^s}, $$ where $\mu$ is a measure satisfying an $\alpha$-dimensional growth condition. In addition, we establish related inhomogeneous estimates and $L^2$ local smoothing estimates. A surprising feature of our work is that, despite dealing with rough fractal sets, we extend the known estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger operators in a natural way, precisely consistent with the associated fractal dimensions.</description>

      <title>Superposition Property in Disjoint Variables for the Infinity Laplace Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a superposition principle in disjoint variables for the inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation. We show that the sum of viscosity solutions of the inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation in separate domains is a viscosity solution in the product domain. This result has been used in the literature with certain particular choices of solutions to simplify regularity analysis for a general inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation by reducing it to the case without sign-changing inhomogeneous terms and vanishing gradient singularities. We present a proof of this superposition principle for general viscosity solutions. We also explore generalization in metric spaces using cone comparison techniques and study related properties for general elliptic and convex equations.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Keller-Segel equations with sensitivity adjustment in Besov spaces: Global well-posedness and blow-up criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the initial value problem for the hyperbolic Keller-Segel (HKS) equation with sensitivity adjustment in Besov sapces over $\mathbb{R}^d$: $\partial_t u + \nabla \cdot \left(\varrho (t) u (1 - u) \nabla S \right)= 0$, $\Delta S = S - u$, where $\varrho (t) (1 - u)$ denotes the adjustment of the classical chemotaxis sensitively by virtue of a time-dependent function $\varrho$. In the case of $\varrho\equiv 1$, existed results [Zhou et al., \emph{J. Differ. Equ.}, 302 (2021) 662-679] and [Zhang et al., \emph{J. Differ. Equ.}, 334 (2022) 451-489] have shown that the HKS equation admits local-in-time Besov solution, whereas the global theory in Besov space still remains an unsolved problem. The main novelty of our observation lies in the fact that if the chemotaxis sensitivity is adjusted by the function $\varrho(t)$ with suitable integrability over $[0,\infty)$, then the associated HKS equation possesses a unique global-in-time Besov solution. As an application, we conclude that the HKS equation with weakly dissipation $-\lambda u$ (i.e., a nonzero interaction-related source term) can also be globally solved in the framework of Besov spaces. Moreover, we derive two types of blow-up criteria for strong solutions in both critical and non-critical Besov spaces, and explicitly characterize the lower bound of blow-up time. These findings reveals how time-dependent parameters (especially, the dissipation parameter $\lambda$) affect the global existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and mixing for locally monotone stochastic evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish general quantitative conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive Wiener noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated exponentially ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Furthermore, we provide quantitative upper bounds for the Wasserstein $\varepsilon$-mixing times. Examples on possibly unbounded domains include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>A fast Fourier spectral method for the linearized Boltzmann collision operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fast Fourier spectral method to compute linearized collision operators of the Boltzmann equation for variable hard-sphere gases. While the state-of-the-art method provides a computational cost O(MN^4 log N), with N being the number of modes in each direction and M being the number of quadrature points on a hemisphere, our method reduces the cost to O(N^4 log N), removing the factor M, which could be large in our numerical tests. The method is applied in a numerical solver for the steady-state Boltzmann equation with quadratic collision operators. Numerical experiments for both spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous Boltzmann equations have been carried out to test the accuracy and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Short-time existence of Lagrangian mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his paper `Conjectures on Bridgeland Stability', Joyce asked if one can desingularise the transverse intersection point of an immersed Lagrangian using JLT expanders such that one gets a Lagrangian mean curvature flow via the desingularisations. Begley and Moore answered this in the affirmative by constructing a family of desingularisations and showing that a certain limit along their flows satisfies LMCF along with convergence to the immersed Lagrangian in the sense of varifolds. We prove that there exists a solution with convergence in a stronger sense, using the notion of manifolds with corners and a-corners as introduced by Joyce. Our methods are a direct P.D.E. based approach, along the lines of the proof of short-time existence for network flow by Lira, Mazzeo, Pluda and Saez.</description>

      <title>Robust and fast iterative method for the elliptic Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a fast and robust iterative scheme for the elliptic Monge-Amp\`ere equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The Monge-Amp\`ere equation is a nonlinear and degenerate equation, with applications in optimal transport, geometric optics, and differential geometry. The proposed method linearises the equation and uses a fixed-point iteration (L-scheme), solving a Poisson problem in each step with a weighted residual as the right-hand side. This algorithm is robust against discretisation, nonlinearities, and degeneracies. For a weight greater than the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, contraction in $H^2$ and $L^\infty$ is proven for both classical and generalised solutions, respectively. The method's performance can be enhanced by using preconditioners or Green's functions. Test cases demonstrate that the scheme outperforms Newton's method in speed and stability.</description>
