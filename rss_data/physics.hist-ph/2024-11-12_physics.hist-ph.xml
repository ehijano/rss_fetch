      <title>Revolutionizing Quantum Mechanics: The Birth and Evolution of the Many-Worlds Interpretation</title>

Abstract: The Many-worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics has captivated physicists and philosophers alike since its inception in the mid-20th century. This paper explores the historical roots, evolution, and implications of the MWI within the context of quantum theory. Beginning with an overview of early developments in quantum mechanics and the emergence of foundational interpretations, we delve into the origins of the MWI through the groundbreaking work of physicist Hugh Everett III. Everett's doctoral thesis proposed a radical solution to the measurement problem, positing the existence of multiple branching universes to account for quantum phenomenon. We trace the evolution of the MWI, examining its refinement and elaboration by subsequent physicists such as John Wheeler. Furthermore, we discuss the MWI's impact on contemporary physics, including its connections to quantum information theory and ongoing experimental tests. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the MWI's historical development and current relevance, this paper offers insights into one of the most provocative interpretations of quantum mechanics and its implications for our understanding of the universe.</description>

      <title>A cognitive basis for physical time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The treatment of time in relativity does not conform to that in quantum theory. In the context of quantum gravity this is called "the problem of time". A crucial difference is that time $t$ may be seen as an observable in relativity theory, just like position $x$, whereas in quantum theory $t$ is a parameter, in contrast to the observable $x$. Aiming to resolve the discrepancy, a formalization of time in the spirit of Kant's Copernican revolution is suggested, where it is required that the treatment of time in physics agree with our cognition. This leads to reconsideration of the notions of identity and change of objects, as well as the nature of physical states and their evolution. The formalization has two components: sequential time $n$ and relational time $t$. The evolution of physical states is described in terms of $n$, which is updated each time an event occurs. The role of $t$ is to quantify distances between events in space-time. There is a space-time associated with each $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal distances between present and past events. A universal ordering of events in terms of $n$ can be postulated even though distances $t$ are relativistic. In short, it is argued that time as a sequential flow of events should be separated from time as a measure of distance between events. In physical models, these aspects of time can be expressed as one evolution parameter and one observable, respectively.</description>

      <title>Thirty years of Erice on the brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.11658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After initially meeting with fierce resistance, "branes", p-dimensional extended objects which go beyond particles (p=0) and strings (p=1), now occupy centre stage in theoretical physics as microscopic components of M-theory, as the seeds of the AdS/CFT correspondence, as a branch of particle phenomenology, as the higher-dimensional progenitors of black holes and, via the "brane-world", as entire universes in their own right. Notwithstanding this early opposition, Nino Zichichi invited me to to talk about supermembranes and eleven dimensions at the 1987 School on Subnuclear Physics and has continued to keep Erice on the brane ever since. Here I provide a distillation of my Erice brane lectures and some personal recollections.</description>
