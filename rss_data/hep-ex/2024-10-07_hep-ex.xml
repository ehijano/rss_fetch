      <title>MicroBooNE investigations on the photon interpretation of the MiniBooNE low energy excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MicroBooNE experiment is a liquid argon time projection chamber with 85-ton active volume at Fermilab, operated from 2015 to 2020 to collect neutrino data from Fermilab's Booster Neutrino Beam. One of MicroBooNE's physics goals is to investigate possible explanations of the low-energy excess observed by the MiniBooNE experiment in $\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow \nu_{e}$ neutrino oscillation measurements. MicroBooNE has performed searches to test hypothetical interpretations of the MiniBooNE low-energy excess, including the underestimation of the photon background or instrinic $\nu_{e}$ background. This thesis presents MicroBooNE's searches for two neutral current (NC) single-photon production processes that contribute to the photon background of the MiniBooNE measurement: NC $\Delta$ resonance production followed by $\Delta$ radiative decay: $\Delta \rightarrow N\gamma$, and NC coherent single-photon production. Both searches take advantage of boosted decision trees to yield efficient background rejection, and a high-statistic NC $\pi^0$ measurement to constrain dominant background, and make use of MicroBooNE's first three years of data. The NC $\Delta \rightarrow N\gamma$ measurement yielded a bound on the $\Delta$ radiative decay process at 2.3 times the predicted nominal rate at 90% confidence level (C.L.), disfavoring a candidate photon interpretation of the MiniBooNE low-energy excess as a factor of 3.18 times the nominal NC $\Delta$ radiative decay rate at the 94.8% C.L. The NC coherent single photon measurement leads to the world's first experimental limit on the cross-section of this process below 1 GeV, of $1.49 \times 10^{-41} \text{cm}^2$ at 90% C.L., corresponding to 24.0 times the nominal prediction.</description>

      <title>Study of same-sign W boson scattering and anomalous couplings in events with one tau lepton from pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} $ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first measurement is presented of the cross section for the scattering of same-sign W boson pairs via the detection of a $\tau$ lepton. The data from proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV were collected by the CMS detector at the LHC, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Events were selected that contain two jets with large pseudorapidity and large invariant mass, one $\tau$ lepton, one light lepton (e or $\mu$), and significant missing transverse momentum. The measured cross section for electroweak same-sign WW scattering is 1.44$^{+0.63}_{-0.56}$ times the standard model prediction. In addition, a search is presented for the indirect effects of processes beyond the standard model via the effective field theory framework, in terms of dimension-6 and dimension-8 operators.</description>

      <title>Measurements of decay branching fractions of the Higgs boson to hadronic final states at the CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a large-scale particle accelerator designed to collide electrons and positrons at high energies. One of the primary goals of the CEPC is to achieve high-precision measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson, facilitated by the large number of Higgs bosons that can be produced with significantly low contamination. The measurements of Higgs boson branching fractions into $b\overline{b} /c\overline{c} /gg$ and $WW^{*} /ZZ^{*} $, where the $W$ or $Z$ bosons decay hadronically, are presented in the context of the CEPC experiment, assuming a scenario with 5600 fb$^{-1}$ of collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 240 GeV. In this study the Higgs bosons are produced in association with a $Z$ boson, with the $Z$ boson decaying into a pair of muons $(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})$, which have high efficiency and high resolution. In order to separate all decay channels simultaneously with high accuracy, the Particle Flow Network (PFN), a graph-based machine learning model, is considered. The precise classification provided by the PFN is employed in measuring the branching fractions using the migration matrix method, which accurately corrects for detector effects in each decay channel. The statistical uncertainty of the measured branching ratio is estimated to be 0.58\% in $H\to b\overline{b}$ final state, and approximately 2\%-10\% in $H\to c\overline{c} /gg/WW^{*} /ZZ^{*} $ final states. In addition, the main sources of systematic uncertainties to the measurement of the branching fractions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum entanglement in top quark pairs at the ATLAS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS Collaboration has recently reported the first observation of quantum entanglement in top quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A brief review of the experimental status of top quark pair spin correlations is given, before highlighting the expected differences between classical and quantum correlations. A criterion for the detection of spin entanglement in top quark pairs has been proposed; the experimental strategy to implement it and observe the effect is discussed, and the positive results of the ATLAS measurement are presented.</description>

      <title>RESuM: Rare Event Surrogate Model for Physics Detector Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental discovery of neutrinoless double-beta decay (NLDBD) would answer one of the most important questions in physics: Why is there more matter than antimatter in our universe? To maximize the chances of detection, NLDBD experiments must optimize their detector designs to minimize the probability of background events contaminating the detector. Given that this probability is inherently low, design optimization either requires extremely costly simulations to generate sufficient background counts or contending with significant variance. In this work, we formalize this dilemma as a Rare Event Design (RED) problem: identifying optimal design parameters when the design metric to be minimized is inherently small. We then designed the Rare Event Surrogate Model (RESuM) for physics detector design optimization under RED conditions. RESuM uses a pretrained Conditional Neural Process (CNP) model to incorporate additional prior knowledges into a Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process model. We applied RESuM to optimize neutron moderator designs for the LEGEND NLDBD experiment, identifying an optimal design that reduces neutron background by ($66.5\pm3.5$)% while using only 3.3% of the computational resources compared to traditional methods. Given the prevalence of RED problems in other fields of physical sciences, the RESuM algorithm has broad potential for simulation-intensive applications.</description>

      <title>Impressions of Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (DFs) have long been recognised as key measures of hadron structure. Today, theoretical prediction of such DFs is becoming possible using diverse methods for continuum and lattice analyses of strong interaction (QCD) matrix elements. Recent developments include a demonstration that continuum and lattice analyses yield mutually consistent results for all pion DFs, with behaviour on the far valence domain of light-front momentum fraction that matches QCD expectations. Theory is also delivering an understanding of the distributions of proton mass and spin amongst its constituents, which varies, of course, with the resolving scale of the measuring probe. Aspects of these developments are sketched herein.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling for Identified Mesons and Baryons: Insights into Medium Transport Properties, Equation of State and Hadronic Re-scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for identified mesons and baryons are derived from species-dependent measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy coefficients \(v_2(p_T, \text{cent})\) and \(v_3(p_T, \text{cent})\), in Pb+Pb collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76\) TeV and 5.02 TeV, Xe+Xe collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44\) TeV, and Au+Au collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 0.2\) TeV. The scaling functions capture species-specific responses to radial flow and hadronic re-scattering, demonstrating consistency across flow- and jet-quenching-dominated \(p_T\) regions. These results provide robust constraints on fundamental transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), including the specific shear viscosity \(\eta/s\) and the jet-quenching parameter \(\hat{q}\), as well as insight into the centrality-dependent evolution of radial flow, a vital aspect of the system's dynamics. The findings reveal minimal influence from hadronic re-scattering at high beam energies and significant influence from re-scattering at lower energies. The centrality-dependent evolution of radial flow and the beam energy dependence of \(\eta/s\) offer new constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of the QGP, with important implications for advancing studies of QGP transport properties and heavy-ion collision dynamics.</description>

      <title>Correlations between azimuthal anisotropy and mean transverse momentum in pp, pPb, and peripheral PbPb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlations between azimuthal anisotropy and mean transverse momentum of charged particles in proton-proton (pp), proton-lead (pPb), and peripheral lead-lead (PbPb) collisions are presented as a function of charged particle multiplicity. The pp, pPb and PbPb collision data were collected using the CMS detector at the LHC with a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 13, 8.16 and 5.02 TeV, respectively. The two- and four-particle cumulants for the second- and third-order Fourier anisotropy harmonics are correlated with the mean transverse momentum of charged particles on an event-by-event basis. In pp and pPb systems, the observed correlation coefficients based on two-particle cumulants are found to change from negative to positive values as the charged particle multiplicity decreases. The sign changes disappear when the correlated particles are required to be further apart in pseudorapidity. Additionally, no sign changes in correlation coefficients are observed when employing four-particle cumulants. Models incorporating initial-state gluon saturation and final-state hydrodynamic evolutions are compared to pPb data and the predicted sign changes are not observed.</description>

      <title>Self-compensating Light Calorimetry with Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber for GeV Neutrino Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) is an exceptional dual calorimeter capable of estimating the energy of incident particles through both the ionization charge and the scintillation light. Our studies show that due to the mechanisms of charge recombination and light generation involved in the energy dissipation in liquid argon, light calorimetry in LArTPCs is inherently self-compensating: the missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the extra recombination luminescence compared to the electromagnetic component. Good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) around unity can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields from 0.2 to 1.8 kV/cm.This inherent self-compensation enhances the appeal of light calorimetry in LArTPCs, complementing the well-established charge calorimetry. Using GeV neutrinos as a case study, we show that light calorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the more sophisticated charge imaging calorimetry. The synergy between light and charge calorimetry offers a novel approach to evaluating and mitigating systematic uncertainties in energy measurements with LArTPCs.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Weak Decays of Charmed Baryons in the Topological Diagrammatic Approach: An Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist two distinct ways in realizing the approximate SU(3) flavor symmetry of QCD to describe the two-body nonleptonic decays of charmed baryons: the irreducible SU(3) approach (IRA) and the topological diagram approach (TDA). The TDA has the advantage that it is more intuitive, graphic and easier to implement model calculations. We perform a global fit to the currently available data of two-body charmed baryon decays within the framework of the TDA and IRA. The number of the minimum set of tensor invariants in the IRA and the topological amplitudes in the TDA is the same, namely, five in the tree-induced amplitudes and four in the penguin amplitudes. Since we employ the new LHCb measurements to fix the sign ambiguity of the decay parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$, the fit results for the magnitudes of $S$- and $P$-wave amplitudes and their phase shift $\delta_P-\delta_S$ in both the TDA and IRA are more trustworthy than our previous analyses with uncertainties substantially improved. These results can be tested in the near future. The perspective of having direct {\it CP} violation in the charmed baryon sector at the per mille level is briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: Radon is a common background source for underground astroparticle physics experiments and its removal is essential. In this study, we fabricated several prototype silver-ion exchanged zeolites, measured their radon adsorption properties, and evaluated their applicability for radon removal in underground experiments. As a result, we succeeded in producing a prototype silver-ion exchanged zeolite that showed better radon adsorption properties than preceding studies.</description>

      <title>How charming can the Higgs be?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling of the Higgs boson to first and second generation fermions has yet to be measured experimentally. There still could be very large deviations in these couplings, as the origin of flavor is completely unknown. Nevertheless, if Yukawa couplings are modified, especially for light generations, there are generically strong constraints from flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs). Therefore, it is imperative to understand whether there exists viable UV physics consistent with current data that motivates future Higgs coupling probes. In particular, the charm-quark Yukawa is the next quark coupling that could be measured at the LHC if it is a few times larger than the SM and compatible with flavor data. This is difficult to achieve in the context of standard ansatz such as Minimal Flavor Violation. In this paper we show that within the framework of Spontaneous Flavor Violation (SFV), using a Two Higgs Doublet Model as an example, the Higgs can be sufficiently charming that new LHC probes are relevant. In this charming region, we show that new Higgs states near the EW scale with large couplings to quarks are required, providing complementary observables or new constraints on the SM Yukawa couplings. The down-type SFV mechanism enabling the suppression of FCNCs also allows for independent modifications to the up-quark Yukawa coupling, which we explore in detail as well.</description>

      <title>Study of Gas Electron Multiplier Detector Using ANSYS and GARFIELD$^{++}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) represent a category of gaseous ionization detectors that utilize microelectronics. They feature a remarkably small distance between the high potential difference anode and cathode electrodes and are typically filled with gases. When a high-energy particle interacts with the gas medium, it generates ions and electrons, which are subsequently accelerated in opposite directions due to the applied electric field. Deflected electrons trigger further ionization to create electron-ion pairs through an avalanche process. These particles can be detected with very high precision at the readout. The Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is one type of MPGD constructed with a polyimide film sandwiched between two conductors under a high voltage difference. Microscopic holes in the foil facilitate electron avalanche. However, the current geometry of the GEM detector used in various experiments is sub-optimal for the gain and performance. In this study, we have modified the geometry of the GEM detector to enhance the gain, reduce ions backflow, and enhance the performance of the detector. We are proposing a new geometry of the GEM detector foil for higher gain, better performance, and durability. For this study, the geometry has been constructed in ANSYS, and further studies have been performed using Garfield$^{++}$.</description>

      <title>Experimentation at a muon collider</title>

Abstract: Experimental activities involving multi-TeV muon collisions are a relatively recent endeavor. The community has limited experience in designing detectors for lepton interactions at center-of-mass energies of 10 TeV and beyond. This review provides a short overview of the machine characteristics and outlines potential sources of beam-induced background that could impact the detector performance. The strategy for mitigating the effects of beam-induced background on the detector at $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV is discussed, focusing on the machine-detector interface, detector design, and the implementation of reconstruction algorithms. The physics potential at this center-of-mass energy is evaluated using a detailed detector simulation that incorporates the effects of beam-induced background. This evaluation concerns the Higgs boson couplings and the Higgs field potential sensitivity, that then are used to get confidence on the expectations at 10 TeV. The physics and detector requirements for an experiment at $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV, outlined here, form the foundation for the initial detector concept at that center-of-mass energy .</description>

Abstract: We present a study of $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$, $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta$, and $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime}$ decays using the Belle and Belle~II data samples, which have integrated luminosities of 980~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ and 426~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, respectively. We measure the following relative branching fractions $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.48 \pm 0.02 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.03 ({\rm syst}) ,$$ $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta)/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.11 \pm 0.01 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.01 ({\rm syst}) ,$$ $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.08 \pm 0.02 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.01 ({\rm syst}) $$ for the first time, where the uncertainties are statistical ($\rm stat$) and systematic ($\rm syst$). By multiplying by the branching fraction of the normalization mode, ${\mathcal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+})$, we obtain the following absolute branching fraction results $(6.9 \pm 0.3 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.5 ({\rm syst}) \pm 1.3 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, $(1.6 \pm 0.2 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.2 ({\rm syst}) \pm 0.3 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, and $(1.2 \pm 0.3 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.1 ({\rm syst}) \pm 0.2 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, for $\Xi_{c}^{0}$ decays to $\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$, $\Xi^{0}\eta$, and $\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime}$ final states, respectively. The third errors are from the uncertainty on ${\mathcal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+})$. The asymmetry parameter for $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$ is measured to be $\alpha(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}) = -0.90\pm0.15({\rm stat})\pm0.23({\rm syst})$.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the polarizations of prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) mesons produced in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarizations of prompt and non-prompt J$/\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) mesons are measured in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, using data samples collected by the CMS experiment in 2017 and 2018, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 103.3 fb$^{-1}$. Based on the analysis of the dimuon decay angular distributions in the helicity frame, the polar anisotropy, $\lambda_\theta$, is measured as a function of the transverse momentum, $p_\mathrm{T}$, of the charmonium states, in the 25-120 and 20-100 GeV ranges for the J$/\psi$ and $\psi$(2S), respectively. The non-prompt polarizations agree with predictions based on the hypothesis that, for $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\gtrsim$ 25 GeV, the non-prompt J$/\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) are predominantly produced in two-body B meson decays. The prompt results clearly exclude strong transverse polarizations, even for $p_\mathrm{T}$ exceeding 30 times the J$/\psi$ mass, where $\lambda_\theta$ tends to an asymptotic value around 0.3. Taken together with previous measurements, by CMS and LHCb at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, the prompt polarizations show a significant variation with $p_\mathrm{T}$, at low $p_\mathrm{T}$.</description>

      <title>Searching for heavy neutral leptons through exotic Higgs decays at the ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study we investigate the feasibility of detecting heavy neutral leptons ($N_d$) through exotic Higgs decays at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC), specifically in the channel of $e^+ e^- \to qq~ H$ with $H\to \nu N_d \to \nu~lW \to \nu l~qq$. Analyses based on full detector simulations of the ILD are performed at the center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV for two different beam polarization schemes with a total integrated luminosity of 2 $\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$. A range of heavy neutral lepton masses between the $Z$ boson and Higgs boson masses are studied. The $2\sigma$ significance reach for the joint branching ratio of $BR(H\to\nu N_d)\cdot BR(N_d\to lW)$ is about 0.1\%, nearly independent of the heavy neutral lepton masses, while the $5\sigma$ discovery is possible at a branching ratio of $0.3\%$. Interpreting these results in terms of constraints on the mixing parameters $|\varepsilon_{id}|^2$ between SM neutrinos and the heavy neutral lepton, it is expected to have a factor of 10 improvement from current constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedding symmetries in the architectures of deep neural networks can improve classification and network convergence in the context of jet substructure. These results hint at the existence of symmetries in jet energy depositions, such as rotational symmetry, arising from the physical features of the underlying processes. We introduce new jet observables, Jet Rotational Metrics (JRMs), which provide insights into the substructure of jets by comparing them to jets with perfect discrete rotational symmetry. We show that JRMs are formidable jet features, achieving good classification scores when used as inputs to deep neural networks. We also show that when used in combination with other jet observables, like N-subjettiness and EFPs, our features increase classification performance. The results suggest that JRMs may capture information not efficiently captured by the other observables, motivating the design of future jet observables for learning the underlying symmetries in the physical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03373v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the propagator, derived from an Effective Field Theory (EFT) that incorporates Weinberger's compositeness theorem, provides a more general formula for describing S-wave near-threshold states. By fitting the lineshape using this propagator, we can extract the $Z$ factor for these states and elucidate their structures.</description>

      <title>Weak decays of $\pmb{B_c}$ involving vector mesons in self-consistent covariant light-front approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of weak transition form factors, semileptonic decays, and nonleptonic decays of $B_c$ meson involving pseudoscalar ($P$) and vector ($V$) meson for bottom-conserving and bottom-changing decay modes. We employ self-consistent covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM), termed as Type-II correspondence, to calculate the $B_c$ to $P(V)$ transition form factors. The Type-II correspondence in the CLF approach gives self-consistent results associated with the $B^{(i)}_j$ functions, which vanish numerically after the replacement $M^{\prime(\prime\prime)} \to M_0^{\prime(\prime\prime)}$ in traditional Type-I correspondence, and the covariance of the matrix elements is also restored. We investigate these effects on bottom-conserving $B_c$ to $P(V)$ form factors that have not yet been studied in CLFQM Type-II correspondence. In addition, we quantify the implications of self-consistency propagating to weak decays involving both bottom-conserving and bottom-changing $B_c$ transition form factors. We use two different parameterizations, the usual three-parameter function of $q^2$ and the model-independent $z$-series expansion, to establish a clear understanding of $q^2$ dependence. Using the numerical values of the form factors, we predict the branching ratios and other physical observables, such as forward-backward asymmetries, polarization fractions, etc., of the semileptonic $B_c$ decays. Subsequently, we predict the branching ratios of two-body nonleptonic weak decays using the factorization hypothesis in self-consistent CLFQM. We also compare our results with those of other theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Global fit to $b \to c\tau\nu$ anomalies as of Spring 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several new experimental results of the test of lepton flavor universality (LFU) in $B\to D^{(\ast)}$ semi-leptonic decays were announced: the first result of $R_{D}$ from the LHCb Run 1 data, the first results of $R_{D}$ and $R_{D^\ast}$ from the LHCb Run 2 data, and the first result of $R_{D^\ast}$ from the Belle II collaboration. Including these new data, a global analysis still prefers the violation of the LFU between the tau and light leptons. A new world average of the data from the BaBar, LHCb, Belle, and Belle II collaborations is $R_{D} = 0.342 \pm 0.026$ and $R_{D^{\ast}} = 0.287 \pm 0.012$. Including this new data, we update a circumstance of the $b \to c \tau \overline\nu$ measurements and their implications for new physics (NP). Incorporating recent developments for the $B \to D^{(\ast)}$ form factors in the Standard Model (SM), we observe a $4.4 \sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction. Our updates also include; model-independent NP formulae for the related observables; and the global fittings of parameters for leptoquark scenarios as well as single NP operator scenarios. Furthermore, we show future potential to indirectly distinguish different NP scenarios with the use of the precise measurements of the polarization observables in $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau \overline\nu$ at the Belle II and the high-$p_{\rm T}$ flavored-tail searches at the LHC. We also discuss an impact on the LFU violation in $\Upsilon \to l^+ l^-$.</description>

      <title>An $\textit{ab initio}$ strategy for taming nuclear-structure dependence of $ V_{ud} $ extractions: the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first \textit{ab initio} calculation of the nuclear-structure-dependent radiative correction $ \delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } $ to the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition, computed with the no-core shell model and chiral effective field theory. We obtain $\delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } = - 0.422 (29)_{ \mathrm{nuc} } (12)_{ n,\mathrm{el} } $ with a $1.6$-times reduction in the total uncertainty when compared to the current literature estimate based on the shell model and Fermi gas picture. This work paves the way for a precise determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed beta decays within a systematically improvable framework.</description>

Abstract: Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or ``axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy logic for reconstructing arbitrary moments of multiplicity distributions</title>

Abstract: The Identity Method is a statistical technique developed to reconstruct moments of multiplicity distributions of particles produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. The method leverages principles from fuzzy logic, allowing for a more nuanced representation of particle identification by assigning degrees of membership to different particle types based on detector signals. In this contribution, a new framework, based on a multivariate moment generation function, is developed that allows the derivation of the formulas used in the Identity Method in a more robust way. Moreover, within the introduced framework, the Identity Method is easily extended to cope with arbitrarily higher-order moments. The techniques developed here offer significant potential for improving the accuracy of multiplicity distribution analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions. While the primary focus of the work presented is on applications in high-energy particle and nuclear physics, it can also be applied in other areas where signal identification is probabilistic and data are noisy, such as in medical imaging, remote sensing, and various other fields of experimental science.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>
