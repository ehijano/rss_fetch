      <title>Advanced Algebraic Manipulation Techniques in Quadratic Programming for Fuzzy Clustering with Generalized Capacity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an advanced mathematical analysis and simplification of the quadratic programming problem arising from fuzzy clustering with generalized capacity constraints. We extend previous work by incorporating broader balancing constraints, allowing for weighted data points and clusters with specified capacities. Through new algebraic manipulation techniques, the original high-dimensional problem is decomposed into smaller, more tractable subproblems. Additionally, we introduce efficient algorithms for solving the reduced systems by leveraging properties of the problem's structure. Comprehensive examples with synthetic and real datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in practical scenarios, with a performance comparison against existing methods. A convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is also included, demonstrating its reliability. Limitations and contexts where the application of these techniques may not be efficient are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the cyclic 3-manifold covers of the type surface x R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article contains a proof of the fact that, under certain mild technical conditions, the action of the automorphism group of a cyclic 3-manifold cover of the type SxR, where S is a compact surface, yields a compact quotient. This result is then immediately applied to extend a theorem on the fiberings over the circle of certain compact 3-manifolds which are torus sums. As a corollary, I prove the validity of the conditional main theorem in my article titled "A fibering theorem for 3-manifolds", which appeared in the Journal of Groups, Complexity, Cryptology in 2021 and its subsequent erratum. This paper also furnishes a proof of the irreducibility of the summands of compact 3-manifolds which are torus sums and irreducible, and a proof of the interesting observation that a compact connected orientable 3-manifold whose fundamental group contains a subnormal subgroup of infinite index is the connected sum of an irreducible compact 3-manifold with (finitely many) 3-balls.</description>
