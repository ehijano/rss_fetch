      <title>Counting Subnetworks Under Gene Duplication in Genetic Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene duplication is a fundamental evolutionary mechanism that contributes to biological complexity and diversity (Fortna et al., 2004). Traditionally, research has focused on the duplication of gene sequences (Zhang, 1914). However, evidence suggests that the duplication of regulatory elements may also play a significant role in the evolution of genomic functions (Teichmann and Babu, 2004; Hallin and Landry, 2019). In this work, the evolution of regulatory relationships belonging to gene-specific-substructures in a GRN are modeled. In the model, a network grows from an initial configuration by repeatedly choosing a random gene to duplicate. The likelihood that the regulatory relationships associated with the selected gene are retained through duplication is determined by a vector of probabilities. Occurrences of gene-family-specific substructures are counted under the gene duplication model. In this thesis, gene-family-specific substructures are referred to as subnetwork motifs. These subnetwork motifs are motivated by network motifs which are patterns of interconnections that recur more often in a specialized network than in a random network (Milo et al., 2002). Subnetwork motifs differ from network motifs in the way that subnetwork motifs are instances of gene-family-specific substructures while network motifs are isomorphic substructures. These subnetwork motifs are counted under Full and Partial Duplication, which differ in the way in which regulation relationships are inherited. Full duplication occurs when all regulatory links are inherited at each duplication step, and Partial Duplication occurs when regulation inheritance varies at each duplication step. Moments for the number of occurrences of subnetwork motifs are determined in each model. The results presented offer a method for discovering subnetwork motifs that are significant in a GRN under gene duplication.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Molecular Generation with Hierarchical Textual Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02845</link>

Abstract: Developing an effective molecular generation framework even with a limited number of molecules is often important for its practical deployment, e.g., drug discovery, since acquiring task-related molecular data requires expensive and time-consuming experimental costs. To tackle this issue, we introduce Hierarchical textual Inversion for Molecular generation (HI-Mol), a novel data-efficient molecular generation method. HI-Mol is inspired by the importance of hierarchical information, e.g., both coarse- and fine-grained features, in understanding the molecule distribution. We propose to use multi-level embeddings to reflect such hierarchical features based on the adoption of the recent textual inversion technique in the visual domain, which achieves data-efficient image generation. Compared to the conventional textual inversion method in the image domain using a single-level token embedding, our multi-level token embeddings allow the model to effectively learn the underlying low-shot molecule distribution. We then generate molecules based on the interpolation of the multi-level token embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HI-Mol with notable data-efficiency. For instance, on QM9, HI-Mol outperforms the prior state-of-the-art method with 50x less training data. We also show the effectiveness of molecules generated by HI-Mol in low-shot molecular property prediction.</description>

      <title>A compositional account of motifs, mechanisms, and dynamics in biochemical regulatory networks</title>

Abstract: Regulatory networks depict promoting or inhibiting interactions between molecules in a biochemical system. We introduce a category-theoretic formalism for regulatory networks, using signed graphs to model the networks and signed functors to describe occurrences of one network in another, especially occurrences of network motifs. With this foundation, we establish functorial mappings between regulatory networks and other mathematical models in biochemistry. We construct a functor from reaction networks, modeled as Petri nets with signed links, to regulatory networks, enabling us to precisely define when a reaction network could be a physical mechanism underlying a regulatory network. Turning to quantitative models, we associate a regulatory network with a Lotka-Volterra system of differential equations, defining a functor from the category of signed graphs to a category of parameterized dynamical systems. We extend this result from closed to open systems, demonstrating that Lotka-Volterra dynamics respects not only inclusions and collapsings of regulatory networks, but also the process of building up complex regulatory networks by gluing together simpler pieces. Formally, we use the theory of structured cospans to produce a lax double functor from the double category of open signed graphs to that of open parameterized dynamical systems. Throughout the paper, we ground the categorical formalism in examples inspired by systems biology.</description>
