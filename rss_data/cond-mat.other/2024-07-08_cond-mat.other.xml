      <title>Diffusive dynamics of fractionalized particles and the enhanced conductivity at the border of the neutral-ionic transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the diffusive dynamics of the classical one-dimensional lattice model of mobile particles featuring the incoherent metallic state of the organic TTF-CA found in the vicinity of the neutral-ionic(NI)-transition. The particles are strongly correlated and feel the alternating site potentials, exhibiting uniform ionic (I) Mott insulating and neutral band insulating (N) phases when the Coulomb interaction and site potentials are large, respectively. We focus on the neutral-ionic domain walls (NIDW) activated by their competition, which is typically regarded as fractionalized particles. The finite temperature phase diagram reveals a thermodynamically stable NIDW phase not found in previous literature that emerges at the triple point, where the transition line splits into two first-order lines toward the critical endpoints. We analyze the long-time behavior of dynamics of the NIDWs and find that it captures the incoherent transport of the system. The conductivity derived from the diffusion constant and the number population of NIDWs shows a strong enhancement inside the NIDW phase, which can explain the large conductivity at the NI crossover recently found in TTF-CA.</description>

      <title>Testing the equivalence between the planar Gross-Neveu and Thirring models at $N=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the Fierz identities predict that the Gross-Neveu and Thirring models should be equivalent when describing systems composed of a single fermionic flavor, $N=1$. Here, we consider the planar version of both models within the framework of the optimized perturbation theory at the two loop level, in order to verify if the predicted equivalence emerges explicitly when different temperature and density regimes are considered. At vanishing densities, our results indicate that both models indeed describe exactly the same thermodynamics, provided that $N=1$. However, at finite chemical potentials we find that the $N=1$ Fierz equivalence no longer holds. After examining the relevant free energies, we have identified the contributions which lead to this puzzling discrepancy. Finally, we discuss different frameworks in which this (so far open) problem could be further understood and eventually circumvented.</description>

      <title>Control of friction: shortcuts and optimization for the rate- and state-variable equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frictional forces are a key ingredient of any physical description of the macroscopic world, as they account for the phenomena causing transformation of mechanical energy into heat. They are ubiquitous in nature, and a wide range of practical applications involve the manipulation of physical systems where friction plays a crucial role. In this paper, we apply control theory to dynamics governed by the paradigmatic rate- and state-variable law for solid-on-solid friction. Several control problems are considered for the case of a slider dragged on a surface by an elastic spring. By using swift state-to-state protocols, we show how to drive the system between two arbitrary stationary states characterized by different constant sliding velocities in a given time. Remarkably, this task proves to be feasible even when specific constraints are imposed on the dynamics, such as preventing the instantaneous sliding velocity or the frictional force from exceeding a prescribed bound. The derived driving protocols also allow to avoid a stick-slip instability, which instead occurs when velocity is suddenly switched. By exploiting variational methods, we also address the functional minimization problem of finding the optimal protocol that connects two steady states in a specified time, while minimizing the work done by the friction. We find that the optimal strategy can change qualitatively depending on the time imposed for the duration of the process. Our results mark a significant step forward in establishing a theoretical framework for control problems in the presence of friction and naturally pave the way for future experiments.</description>

      <title>A proposal to demonstrate non-abelian anyons on a NISQ device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a proposal for realising non-Abelian anyons on a NISQ device. In particular we explore the feasibility of implementing the quantum double model $D(D_4)$. We propose techniques to drastically simplify the circuits for the manipulation and measurements of anyons. Numerical simulations with realistic noise models suggest that current NISQ technology is capable of probing signatures of non-Abelian anyons far beyond elemental properties such as the non-commutativity of braids. In particular, we conclude that experimentally measuring the full modular data of the model is feasible.</description>

      <title>A Non-Abelian Gauge Theory for Surface Excitations of $~^3$He-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04714v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $~^3$He-B, two atoms pair in an orbital angular momentum $1$ spin triplet state above the phase transition temperature with $SO(3) \times SO(3)$ symmetry. Below the transition temperature, this symmetry is spontaneously broken to the diagonal $SO(3)$ due to spin-orbit coupling. Considerations based on effective potentials and solitons show that $SO(3)$'s gets enhanced to $SU(3)$'s and the symmetry breaking is that of $G= SU(3) \times SU(3)\times U(1)$ to $H= SU(3)$. The theory of the resultant Goldtsone modes can be naturally formulated as a gauge theory of $H$. Its Gauss law is treated here and shown to lead to surface states in a container with a dynamics governed by large gauge transformations.
  Observable consequences are pointed. The transference of the analysis to the chiral model of QCD is pointed out where $SU(3)$ are the left and right chiral groups, $U(1)$ is the axial $U(1)$ , the surviving symmetry is flavour $SU(3)$ and the Goldstone modes are the pions.</description>
