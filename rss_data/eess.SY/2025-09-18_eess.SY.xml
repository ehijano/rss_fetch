      <title>A hybrid dynamic model and parameter estimation method for accurately simulating overhead cranes with friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to accurately simulating 3D overhead cranes with friction. Nonlinear friction dynamics have a significant impact on these systems, however, accurately modeling this phenomenon in simulations is a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on imprecise approximations of friction or require excessive computational times for reliable results. To address this, we present a hybrid dynamical model that features a trade-off between high-fidelity friction modeling and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we present a step-by-step algorithm for the comprehensive estimation of all unknown system parameters, including friction. This methodology is based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Least Squares (LS) estimations. Finally, experimental validation with a laboratory crane confirms the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and estimation approach.</description>

      <title>Right-to-Override for Critical Urban Control Systems: A Deliberative Audit Method for Buildings, Power, and Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automation now steers building HVAC, distribution grids, and traffic signals, yet residents rarely have authority to pause or redirect these systems when they harm inclusivity, safety, or accessibility. We formalize a Right-to-Override (R2O) - defining override authorities, evidentiary thresholds, and domain-validated safe fallback states - and introduce a Deliberative Audit Method (DAM) with playbooks for pre-deployment walkthroughs, shadow-mode trials, and post-incident review. We instantiate R2O/DAM in simulations of smart-grid load shedding, building HVAC under occupancy uncertainty, and multi-agent traffic signals. R2O reduces distributional harm with limited efficiency loss: load-shedding disparity in unserved energy drops from 5.61x to 0.69x with constant curtailment; an override eliminates two discomfort-hours for seniors at an energy cost of 77 kWh; and median pedestrian wait falls from 90.4 s to 55.9 s with a 6.0 s increase in mean vehicle delay. We also contribute a policy standard, audit worksheets, and a ModelOps integration pattern to make urban automation contestable and reviewable.</description>

      <title>A novel approach of day-ahead cooling load prediction and optimal control for ice-based thermal energy storage (TES) system in commercial buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) is an effective method for load shifting and demand response in buildings. Optimal TES control and management are essential to improve the performance of the cooling system. Most existing TES systems operate on a fixed schedule, which cannot take full advantage of its load shifting capability, and requires extensive investigation and optimization. This study proposed a novel integrated load prediction and optimized control approach for ice-based TES in commercial buildings. A cooling load prediction model was developed and a mid-day modification mechanism was introduced into the prediction model to improve the accuracy. Based on the predictions, a rule-based control strategy was proposed according to the time-of-use tariff; the mid-day control adjustment mechanism was introduced in accordance with the mid-day prediction modifications. The proposed approach was applied in the ice-based TES system of a commercial complex in Beijing, and achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 389 kW and coefficient of variance of MAE of 12.5%. The integrated prediction-based control strategy achieved an energy cost saving rate of 9.9%. The proposed model was deployed in the realistic building automation system of the case building and significantly improved the efficiency and automation of the cooling system.</description>

      <title>Location and allocation problem of high-speed train maintenance bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintenance bases are crucial for the safe and stable operation of high-speed trains, necessitating significant financial investment for their construction and operation. Planning the location and task allocation of these bases in the vast high-speed railway network is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. This paper explored the strategic planning of identifying optimal locations for maintenance bases, introducing a bi-level programming model. The upper-level objective was to minimize the annualized total cost, including investment for new or expanding bases and total maintenance costs, while the lower-level focused on dispatching high-speed trains to the most suitable base for maintenance tasks, thereby reducing maintenance operation dispatch costs under various investment scenarios. A case study of the Northwest China high-speed rail network demonstrated the application of this model, and included the sensitivity analysis reflecting maintenance policy reforms. The results showed that establishing a new base in Hami and expanding Xi'an base could minimize the total annualized cost during the planning period, amounting to a total of 2,278.15 million RMB. This paper offers an optimization method for selecting maintenance base locations that ensures reliability and efficiency in maintenance work as the number of trains increases in the future.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an equilibrium model of ski resorts where users are assigned to cycles in a closed network. As queues form on lifts with limited capacity, we derive an efficient way to find waiting times via convex optimization. The equilibrium problem is formulated as a variational inequality, and numerical experiments show that it can be solved using standard algorithms.</description>

      <title>Identifying Network Structure of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Contraction and Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the identifiability of network topologies for networked nonlinear systems when partial measurements of the nodes are taken. We explore scenarios where different candidate topologies can yield similar measurements, thus limiting identifiability. To do so, we apply the contraction theory framework to facilitate comparisons between candidate topologies. We show that semicontraction in the observable space is a sufficient condition for two systems to become indistinguishable from one another based on partial measurements. We apply this framework to study networks of Kuramoto oscillators, and discuss scenarios in which different topologies (both connected and disconnected) become indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>The impact of modeling approaches on controlling safety-critical, highly perturbed systems: the case for data-driven models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the impact of three system models on the reference trajectory tracking error of the LQR optimal controller, in the challenging problem of guidance and control of the state of a system under strong perturbations and reconfiguration. We compared a smooth Linear Time Variant system learned from data (DD-LTV) with state of the art Linear Time Variant (LTV) system identification methods, showing its superiority in the task of state propagation. Moreover, we have found that DD-LTV allows for better performance in terms of trajectory tracking error than the standard solutions of a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system model, and comparable performance to a linearized Linear Time Variant (L-LTV) system model. We tested the three approaches on the perturbed and time varying spring-mass-damper systems.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Predictive Control Framework with Statistical Collision Avoidance Constraints for Autonomous Vehicle Overtaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a control framework for the autonomous overtaking of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in a mixed traffic environment, where the overtaken vehicle is an unconnected but interactive human-driven vehicle. The proposed method, termed the Game-Theoretic, PRedictive Overtaking (GT-PRO) strategy, successfully decouples the longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics of the CAV and comprehensively coordinates these decoupled dynamics via innovative longitudinal and lateral model predictive (MPC) based controllers, respectively. To address the real-time interactive behavior of the human-driven overtaken vehicle, a dynamic Stackelberg game-based bilevel optimization is solved by the lateral controller to directly control the CAV lateral motion and predict the overtaken vehicle longitudinal responses that are subsequently shared with a stochastic MPC that governs the CAV longitudinal motion. The proposed strategy exploits a comprehensive real-world dataset, which captures human driver responses when being overtaken, to tune the game-theoretic lateral controller according to the most common human responses, and to statistically characterize human uncertainties and hence implement a collision avoidance chance constraint for the stochastic longitudinal controller. The simulation results for both polite and aggressive human response case studies of the overtaken vehicle demonstrate that the proposed GT-PRO can achieve for this range of human driver responsiveness, safer, more efficient, and more comfortable autonomous overtaking, as compared to existing autonomous overtaking approaches in the literature. Furthermore, the results suggest that the GT-PRO method is capable of real-time implementation.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Verification of Lumped-Parameter, Multibody Structural Dynamics for Offshore Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the modeling and verification of multibody structural dynamics for offshore wind turbines. The flexible tower and support structure of a monopile-based offshore wind turbine are modeled using an acausal, lumped-parameter, multibody approach that incorporates structural flexibility, soil-structure interaction, and hydrodynamic models. Simulation results are benchmarked against alternative modeling approaches, demonstrating the model's ability to accurately capture both static and dynamic behaviors under various wind and wave conditions while maintaining computational efficiency. This work provides a valuable tool for analyzing key structural characteristics of wind turbines, including eigenfrequencies, mode shapes, damping, and internal forces.</description>

      <title>Multi-Attacker Single-Defender Target Defense in Conical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the target defense problem in a planar conical environment where a single defender is tasked to capture a sequence of incoming attackers. The attackers' objective is to breach the target boundary without being captured by the defender. As soon as the current attacker breaches the target or gets captured by the defender, the next attacker appears at the boundary of the environment and moves radially toward the target with maximum speed. Therefore, the defender's final location at the end of the current game becomes its initial location for the next game. The attackers pick strategies that are advantageous for the current as well as for future engagements between the defender and the remaining attackers. The attackers have their own sensors with limited range, using which they can perfectly detect if the defender is within their sensing range. We derive equilibrium strategies for all the players to optimize the capture percentage using the notions of capture distribution. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical examples using Monte Carlo type random trials of experiments.</description>

      <title>Impact of Solar Integration on Grid Security: Unveiling Vulnerabilities in Load Redistribution Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load redistribution (LR) attacks represent a practical and sophisticated form of false data injection (FDI) attacks, where the attacker manipulates grid data to influence economic operations of the grid through misleading security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) decisions. Traditionally, LR attack models operate under the assumption that generator measurements are secure and immune to tampering. However, the increasing integration of solar generation into power grids challenges this assumption, exposing new vulnerabilities. This paper proposes an enhanced load redistribution attack model, addressing new vulnerabilities introduced by the increasing integration of solar generation in power grids. The study demonstrates that manipulating solar generation data significantly disrupts grid economics, with peak impacts during periods of high solar generation.</description>

      <title>Zero-sum turn games using Q-learning: finite computation with security guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses zero-sum ``turn'' games, in which only one player can make decisions at each state. We show that pure saddle-point state-feedback policies for turn games can be constructed from dynamic programming fixed-point equations for a single value function or Q-function. These fixed-points can be constructed using a suitable form of Q-learning. For discounted costs, convergence of this form of Q-learning can be established using classical techniques. For undiscounted costs, we provide a convergence result that applies to finite-time deterministic games, which we use to illustrate our results. For complex games, the Q-learning iteration must be terminated before exploring the full-state, which can lead to policies that cannot guarantee the security levels implied by the final Q-function. To mitigate this, we propose an ``opponent-informed'' exploration policy for selecting the Q-learning samples. This form of exploration can guarantee that the final Q-function provides security levels that hold, at least, against a given set of policies. A numerical demonstration for a multi-agent game, Atlatl, indicates the effectiveness of these methods.</description>

      <title>Scaling green hydrogen and CCUS via cement-methanol co-production in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High costs of green hydrogen and of carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) have hindered policy ambition and slowed real-world deployment, despite their importance for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, including cement and methanol. Given the economic challenges of adopting CCUS in cement and green hydrogen in methanol production separately, we propose a renewable-powered co-production system that couples electrolytic hydrogen and CCUS through molecule exchange. We optimize system configurations using an hourly-resolved, process-based model incorporating operational flexibility, and explore integrated strategies for plant-level deployment and CO2 source-sink matching across China. We find that co-production could reduce CO2 abatement costs to USD 41-53 per tonne by 2035, significantly lower than approximately USD 75 for standalone cement CCUS and over USD 120 for standalone renewable-based methanol. Co-production is preferentially deployed at cement plants in renewable-rich regions, potentially reshaping national CO2 infrastructure planning. This hydrogen-CCUS coupling paradigm could accelerate industrial decarbonization and scaling for other applications.</description>

      <title>Scale Up Analysis of Inductively Heated Metamaterial Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductively heated metamaterial reactors, which utilize an open cell lattice baffle structure as a heating susceptor for magnetic induction, are promising candidates for scaled electrified thermochemical reactor operation due to their ability to support volumetric heating profiles and enhanced heat transfer properties. In this work, we present a systematic scale up analysis of inductive metamaterial reactors where we utilize a combination of analytic modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments to project the capabilities and performance of scaled reactors. We use reverse water gas shift as a model reaction system and show that for reactor configurations featuring a uniform metamaterial susceptor, the total system efficiency increases with scale. However, the throughput of these scaled reactors is limited by radial temperature gradients. We further show this bottleneck can be overcome by tailoring the radial effective conductivity profile of the susceptor, which can enable scaled reactors with nearly ideal plug flow-like capabilities. These concepts provide a pathway towards scaled electrified thermochemical reactors with optimal chemical conversion capabilities.</description>

      <title>Circuit realization and hardware linearization of monotone operator equilibrium networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the port behavior of a resistor-diode network corresponds to the solution of a ReLU monotone operator equilibrium network (a neural network in the limit of infinite depth), giving a parsimonious construction of a neural network in analog hardware. We furthermore show that the gradient of such a circuit can be computed directly in hardware, using a procedure we call hardware linearization. This allows the network to be trained in hardware, which we demonstrate with a device-level circuit simulation. We extend the results to cascades of resistor-diode networks, which can be used to implement feedforward and other asymmetric networks. We finally show that different nonlinear elements give rise to different activation functions, and introduce the novel diode ReLU which is induced by a non-ideal diode model.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Human Limb Movements Using An In-House Multi-Channel Non-Invasive Surface-EMG System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are obtained from muscle cell activity. The recording and analysis of EMG signals has several applications. The EMG is of diagnostic importance for treating patients suffering from neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Conventional methods involve placement of invasive electrodes within the muscles to record EMG signals. The goal is to showcase the usage of surface based EMG signals to characterize all possible human limb movements. An in-house non-invasive EMG signal acquisition system that offers characterization of human limb actions is a suitable candidate for motor impairment studies and easily extendable to design bionics control specifically for neuromuscular disorder patients. An in-house 8-channel surface-EMG signal acquisition system was designed, fabricated, and employed for characterizing specific movements of upper and lower limb. The non-invasive acquisition system captures the compound electromuscular activity generated from the group of muscles. The EMG acquisition system was designed as a modular structure where the front end analog circuit designs were replicated for all 8 channels, and were designed to function independently. Support vector machine (SVM) as classifier models were developed offline to successfully characterize different human limb actions. The in house built 8 channel acquisition system with ML classifier models were utilized to successfully characterize movements at various joints of the upper and lower limb including fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulder, knee, and ankle individually.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Empowered Decision Transformer for UAV-Enabled Data Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reliable and energy-efficient data collection from spatially distributed devices holds great promise in supporting diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework, termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets. Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Equilibria over the Wasserstein Distance for Generalized Nash Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) is fundamental for practical applications where multiple self-interested agents work together to make optimal decisions. In this work, we study GNEP with shared distributionally robust chance constraints (DRCCs) for incorporating inevitable uncertainties. The DRCCs are defined over the Wasserstein ball, which can be explicitly characterized even with limited sample data. To determine the equilibrium of the GNEP, we propose an exact approach to transform the original computationally intractable problem into a deterministic formulation using the Nikaido-Isoda function. Specifically, we show that when all agents' objectives are quadratic in their respective variables, the equilibrium can be obtained by solving a typical mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, where the integer and continuous variables are decoupled in both the objective function and the constraints. This structure significantly improves computational tractability, as demonstrated through a case study on the charging station pricing problem.</description>

      <title>Day-Ahead Transmission Grid Topology Optimization Considering Renewable Energy Sources' Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing renewable penetration introduces significant uncertainty in power system operations. At the same time, the existing transmission grid is often already congested, and urgently needed reinforcements are frequently delayed due to several constraints. To address these challenges, adjusting the grid topology based on congestion patterns is considered a non-costly remedy to guarantee efficient power transmission. Based on this idea, this paper proposes a grid topology optimization model combining optimal transmission switching and busbar splitting for AC and hybrid AC/DC grids. The methodology incorporates RES forecast uncertainty through a scenario-based stochastic optimization approach, using real offshore wind data and K-means clustering to generate representative forecast error scenarios. The proposed model includes several formulations to be compared with a plain optimal power flow (OPF) model: hourly optimizing the topology, one topology for 24 hours, or a limited number of switching actions over a day. The grid topology optimization model is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Convex Problem, optimized based on the day-ahead (D-1) RES forecast and validated for AC-feasibility via an AC-OPF formulation. Based on the generation setpoints of the feasibility check, a redispatch simulation based on the measured (D) RES realization is then computed. The methodology is tested on an AC 30-bus test case and a hybrid AC/DC 50-bus test case, for a 24-hours (30-bus) and a 14-days (both test cases) time series. The results highlight the economic benefits brought by grid topology optimization for congested test cases with high penetration of RES. In addition, the results demonstrate that accounting for RES uncertainty with at least 6 to 8 scenarios leads to lower or comparable total costs to deterministic day-ahead forecasts, even when limiting the frequency of topological actions.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Data-Driven Decentralized Control of Interconnected Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose data-driven decentralized control algorithms for stabilizing interconnected systems. We first derive a data-driven condition to synthesize a local controller that ensures the dissipativity of the local subsystems. Then, we propose data-driven decentralized stability conditions for the global system based on the dissipativity of each local system. Since both conditions take the form of linear matrix inequalities and are based on dissipativity theory, this yields a unified pipeline, resulting in a data-driven decentralized control algorithm. As a special case, we also consider stabilizing systems interconnected through diffusive coupling and propose a control algorithm. We validate the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed control algorithms in numerical examples in the context of microgrids.</description>

      <title>Identifying Network Structure of Linear Dynamical Systems: Observability and Edge Misclassification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the limitations of uniquely identifying a linear network's topology from partial measurements of its nodes. We show that the set of networks that are consistent with the measurements are related through the nullspace of the observability matrix for the true network. In doing so, we illustrate how potentially many networks are fully consistent with the measurements despite having topologies that are structurally inconsistent with each other, an often neglected consideration in the design of topology inference methods. We then provide an aggregate characterization of the space of possible networks by analytically solving for the most structurally dissimilar network. We find that when observing over 6% of nodes in random network models (e.g., Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and Watts-Strogatz) the rate of edge misclassification drops to ~1%. Extending this discussion, we construct a family of networks that keep measurements $\epsilon$-"close" to each other, and connect the identifiability of these networks to the spectral properties of an augmented observability Gramian.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Boundedness of Distributed Set-Membership Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic boundedness is a crucial property of Distributed Set-Membership Filtering (DSMFing) that prevents the unbounded growth of the set estimates caused by the wrapping effect. However, this important property remains underinvestigated, compared to its noise-free and stochastic-noise counterparts, i.e., the convergence of Distributed Observers (DOs) and the bounded error covariance of Distributed Kalman Filters (DKFs). This paper studies the asymptotic boundedness of DSMFing for linear discrete-time systems. A novel concept, termed the Collective Observation-Information Tower (COIT), is introduced to characterize the fundamental relationship between the structure of graphs and the set estimates, which enables the boundedness analysis. Leveraging the COIT, an easily verifiable sufficient condition for the asymptotic boundedness of linear DSMFing is established. Surprisingly, the sufficient condition generalizes the well-known collective detectability condition for DOs and DKFs; it links DSMFs to existing distributed estimation methods and reveals the unique characteristic of DSMFs.</description>

      <title>Safe Sliding Mode Control in Position for Double Integrator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of robust safety control design for double integrator systems. We show that, when the constraints are defined only on position states, it is possible to construct a safe sliding domain from the dynamic of a simple integrator that is already safe. On this domain, the closed-loop trajectories remain robust and safe against uncertainties and disturbances. Furthermore, we design a controller gain that guarantees convergence to the safe sliding domain while avoiding the given unsafe set. The concept is initially developed for first-order sliding mode and is subsequently generalized to an adaptive framework, ensuring that trajectories remain confined to a predefined vicinity of the sliding domain, outside the unsafe region.</description>

      <title>Factored Output Feedback Controller Synthesis with Locality Constraints for Spatially-Invariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider H2 output feedback controller synthesis with pre-specified constraints on spatial communication distance (locality) for spatially-invariant systems using two factored controller frameworks: the system-level parameterization and the input-output parameterization. In our main result, we show that in both frameworks, output feedback controller synthesis with locality constraints can be formulated as a convex problem in finitely many transfer function variables, admitting the use of standard numerical solution techniques. The number of decision variables in the optimal controller design problem scales linearly with the distance of allowed communication. We also show that the optimal controller design problems for the system-level and input-ouptput parameterizations are equivalent for the chosen system of interest. We present numerical examples to illustrate the tradeoff between communication sparsity and performance.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI-Enhanced Supervisory Control for High-Precision Spacecraft Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use artificial intelligence (AI) and supervisory adaptive control systems to plan and optimize the mission of precise spacecraft formation. Machine learning and robust control enhance the efficiency of spacecraft precision formation of the Virtual Telescope for X-ray Observation (VTXO) space mission. VTXO is a precise formation of two separate spacecraft making a virtual telescope with a one-kilometer focal length. One spacecraft carries the lens and the other spacecraft holds the camera to observe high-energy space objects in the X-ray domain with 55 milli-arcsecond angular resolution accuracy. Timed automata for supervisory control, Monte Carlo simulations for stability and robustness evaluation, and integration of deep neural networks for optimal estimation of mission parameters, satisfy the high precision mission criteria. We integrate deep neural networks with a constrained, non-convex dynamic optimization pipeline to predict optimal mission parameters, ensuring precision mission criteria are met. AI framework provides explainability by predicting the resulting energy consumption and mission error for a given set of mission parameters. It allows for transparent, justifiable, and real-time trade-offs, a capability not present in traditional adaptive controllers. The results show reductions in energy consumption and improved mission accuracy, demonstrating the capability of the system to address dynamic uncertainties and disturbances.</description>

      <title>ASTREA: Introducing Agentic Intelligence for Orbital Thermal Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents ASTREA, the first agentic system deployed on flight-heritage hardware (TRL 9) for autonomous spacecraft operations. Using thermal control as a representative use case, we integrate a resource-constrained Large Language Model (LLM) agent with a reinforcement learning controller in an asynchronous architecture tailored for space-qualified platforms. Ground experiments show that LLM-guided supervision improves thermal stability and reduces violations, confirming the feasibility of combining semantic reasoning with adaptive control under hardware constraints. However, on-orbit validation aboard the International Space Station (ISS) reveals performance degradation caused by inference latency mismatched with the rapid thermal cycles characteristic of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. These results highlight both the opportunities and current limitations of agentic LLM-based systems in real flight environments, providing practical design guidelines for future space autonomy.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Detection and Tracking of Foreign Object Intrusions in Power Systems via Feature-Based Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel three-stage framework for real-time foreign object intrusion (FOI) detection and tracking in power transmission systems. The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.</description>

      <title>Complete Decentralization of Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control for the Discrete Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem for the linear wave equation on the unit circle with fully distributed actuation and partial state measurements is considered. An analytical solution to a spatial discretization of the problem is obtained. The main result of this work illustrates that for specific parameter values, the optimal LQG policy is completely decentralized, meaning only a measurement at spatial location $i$ is needed to compute an optimal control signal to actuate at this location. The relationship between performance and decentralization as a function of parameters is explored. Conditions for complete decentralization are related to metrics of kinetic and potential energy quantities and control effort.</description>

      <title>Topological Entropy of Nonlinear Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two general upper bounds on the topological entropy of nonlinear time-varying systems are established: one using the matrix measure of the system Jacobian, the other using the largest real part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix with off-diagonal entries replaced by their absolute values. A general lower bound is constructed using the trace of the Jacobian matrix. For interconnected systems, an upper bound is first derived by adapting one of the general upper bounds, using the matrix measure of an interconnection matrix function. A new upper bound is then developed using the largest real part of the eigenvalues of this function. This new bound is closely related to the individual upper bounds for subsystems and implies each of the two general upper bounds when the system is viewed as one of two suitable interconnections. These entropy bounds all depend only on upper or lower limits of the Jacobian matrix along trajectories.</description>

      <title>Barometer-Aided Attitude Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and robust attitude estimation is a central challenge for autonomous vehicles operating in GNSS-denied or highly dynamic environments. In such cases, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) alone are insufficient for reliable tilt estimation due to the ambiguity between gravitational and inertial accelerations. While auxiliary velocity sensors, such as GNSS, Pitot tubes, Doppler radar, or visual odometry, are often used, they can be unavailable, intermittent, or costly. This work introduces a barometer-aided attitude estimation architecture that leverages barometric altitude measurements to infer vertical velocity and attitude within a nonlinear observer on SO(3). The design cascades a deterministic Riccati observer with a complementary filter, ensuring Almost Global Asymptotic Stability (AGAS) under a uniform observability condition while maintaining geometric consistency. The analysis highlights barometer-aided estimation as a lightweight and effective complementary modality.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Point-to-Point UAV Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in automated inspection, delivery, and navigation tasks that require reliable autonomy. This project develops a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to enable a single UAV to autonomously navigate between predefined points without manual intervention. The drone learns navigation policies through trial-and-error interaction, using a custom reward function that encourages goal-reaching efficiency while penalizing collisions and unsafe behavior. The control system integrates ROS with a Gym-compatible training environment, enabling flexible deployment and testing. After training, the learned policy is deployed on a real UAV platform and evaluated under practical conditions. Results show that the UAV can successfully perform autonomous navigation with minimal human oversight, demonstrating the viability of RL-based control for point-to-point drone operations in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improving cosmological reach of a gravitational wave observatory using Deep Loop Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.</description>

      <title>Prompt2Auto: From Motion Prompt to Automated Control via Geometry-Invariant One-Shot Gaussian Process Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from demonstration allows robots to acquire complex skills from human demonstrations, but conventional approaches often require large datasets and fail to generalize across coordinate transformations. In this paper, we propose Prompt2Auto, a geometry-invariant one-shot Gaussian process (GeoGP) learning framework that enables robots to perform human-guided automated control from a single motion prompt. A dataset-construction strategy based on coordinate transformations is introduced that enforces invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling, while supporting multi-step predictions. Moreover, GeoGP is robust to variations in the user's motion prompt and supports multi-skill autonomy. We validate the proposed approach through numerical simulations with the designed user graphical interface and two real-world robotic experiments, which demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, generalizes across tasks, and significantly reduces the demonstration burden.

      <title>Constraint-Consistent Control of Task-Based and Kinematic RCM Constraints for Surgical Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) requires precise enforcement of the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint to ensure safe tool manipulation through a trocar. Achieving this constraint under dynamic and interactive conditions remains challenging, as existing control methods either lack robustness at the torque level or do not guarantee consistent RCM constraint satisfaction. This paper proposes a constraint-consistent torque controller that treats the RCM as a rheonomic holonomic constraint and embeds it into a projection-based inverse-dynamics framework. The method unifies task-level and kinematic formulations, enabling accurate tool-tip tracking while maintaining smooth and efficient torque behavior. The controller is validated both in simulation and on a RAMIS training platform, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches. Results show improved RCM constraint satisfaction, reduced required torque, and robust performance by improving joint torque smoothness through the consistency formulation under clinically relevant scenarios, including spiral trajectories, variable insertion depths, moving trocars, and human interaction. These findings demonstrate the potential of constraint-consistent torque control to enhance safety and reliability in surgical robotics.

      <title>Quickest Change Detection with Cost-Constrained Experiment Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the classical quickest change detection problem, an observer performs only one experiment to monitor a stochastic process. This paper considers the case where, at each observation time, the decision-maker needs to choose between multiple experiments with different information qualities and costs. The goal is to minimize the worst-case average detection delay subject to false alarm and cost constraints. An algorithm called the 2E-CUSUM Algorithm has been developed to achieve this goal for the two-experiment case. Extensions to multiple-experiment designs are also studied, and 2E-CUSUM is extended accordingly. Data efficiency, where the observer has the choice not to perform an experiment, is explored as well. The proposed algorithms are analyzed and shown to be asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <title>Active Inference Framework for Closed-Loop Sensing, Communication, and Control in UAV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a core technology for 6G, and its application to closed-loop sensing, communication, and control (SCC) enables various services. Existing SCC solutions often treat sensing and control separately, leading to suboptimal performance and resource usage. In this work, we introduce the active inference framework (AIF) into SCC-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems for joint state estimation, control, and sensing resource allocation. By formulating a unified generative model, the problem reduces to minimizing variational free energy for inference and expected free energy for action planning. Simulation results show that both control cost and sensing cost are reduced relative to baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the problem of exact model reduction of positive linear systems, by leveraging minimal realization theory. While determining the existence of a positive reachable realization remains in general an open problem, we are able to fully characterize the cases in which the new model is obtained with non-negative reduction matrices, and hence positivity of the reduced model is robust with respect to small perturbations of the original system. The characterization is obtained by specializing monotone matrix theory to positive matrices. In addition, we provide a systematic method to construct positive reductions also when minimal ones are not available, by exploiting algebraic techniques.</description>

      <title>Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Open-loop Subspace Identification Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subspace identification methods (SIMs) are known for their simple parameterization for MIMO systems and robust numerical properties. However, a comprehensive statistical analysis of SIMs remains an open problem. Following a three-step procedure generally used in SIMs, this work presents a finite sample analysis for open-loop SIMs. In Step 1 we begin with a parsimonious SIM. Leveraging a recent analysis of an individual ARX model, we obtain a union error bound for a Hankel-like matrix constructed from a bank of ARX models. Step 2 involves model reduction via weighted singular value decomposition (SVD), where we use robustness results for SVD to obtain error bounds on extended controllability and observability matrices, respectively. The final Step 3 focuses on deriving error bounds for system matrices, where two different realization algorithms, the MOESP type and the CVA type, are studied. Our results not only agree with classical asymptotic results, but also show how much data is needed to guarantee a desired error bound with high probability. The proposed method generalizes related finite sample analyses and applies broadly to many variants of SIMs.</description>

      <title>Joint Power and Spectrum Orchestration for D2D Semantic Communication Underlying Energy-Efficient Cellular Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18350v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has been recently deemed a promising next-generation wireless technique to enable efficient spectrum savings and information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical network paradigm where cellular and device-to-device (D2D) SemCom approaches coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes complicated and challenging due to the unique semantic performance measurements and energy-consuming semantic coding mechanism. To this end, this paper jointly investigates power control and spectrum reuse problems for energy-efficient D2D SemCom cellular networks. Concretely, we first model the user preference-aware semantic triplet transmission and leverage a novel metric of semantic value to identify the semantic information importance conveyed in SemCom. Then, we define the additional power consumption from semantic encoding in conjunction with basic power amplifier dissipation to derive the overall system energy efficiency (semantic-value/Joule). Next, we formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem for joint power and spectrum allocation subject to several SemCom-related and practical constraints. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management solution by employing the fractional-to-subtractive problem transformation and decomposition while developing a three-stage method with theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the adequate performance superiority of our proposed solution compared with different benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of amplitude-unbounded false data injection (FDI) attacks targeting the sensor-to-controller (S-C) channel in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks. Moreover, the feasible region under this scenario is provided in this paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and shows superior control performance compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As control systems grow in complexity, abstraction-based methods have become essential for designing controllers with formal guarantees. However, a key limitation of these methods is their reliance on discrete-time models, typically obtained by discretizing continuous-time systems with a fixed timestep. This discretization leads to two major problems: when the timestep is small, the abstraction includes numerous stuttering and spurious trajectories, making controller synthesis suboptimal or even infeasible; conversely, a large time step may also render control design infeasible due to a lack of flexibility. In this work, drawing inspiration from Reinforcement Learning concepts, we introduce temporal abstractions, which allow for a flexible timestep. We provide a method for constructing such abstractions and formally establish their correctness in controller design. Furthermore we show how to apply these to optimal control under reachability specifications. Finally we showcase our methods on two numerical examples, highlighting that our approach leads to controllers that achieve a lower worst-case control cost.</description>

Abstract: Worsening global challenges in the Anthropocene demand complex, adaptive solutions grounded in a systems-level understanding of coupled social and environmental dynamics. However, existing modeling approaches often fall short due to disciplinary silos, limited scalability, and the absence of shared ontological frameworks. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), when integrated with Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT), offers a powerful methodology for modeling systems of systems while preserving subsystem heterogeneity and enabling cross-disciplinary integration. This paper presents the first application of the MBSE-HFGT methodology to environmental systems, using a series of worked examples involving flow through lake and land segments. These examples demonstrate how the approach enables consistent, scalable, and integrative modeling of complex environmental processes.</description>

Abstract: Efficient mobile jamming against eavesdroppers in wireless networks necessitates accurate coordination between mobility and antenna beamforming. We study the coordinated beamforming and control problem for a UAV that carries two omnidirectional antennas, and which uses them to jam an eavesdropper while leaving a friendly client unaffected. The UAV can shape its jamming beampattern by controlling its position, its antennas' orientation, and the relative phasing for each antenna. We derive a closed-form expression for the antennas' phases that guarantees zero jamming impact on the client. In addition, we determine the antennas' orientation and the UAV's position that maximizes jamming impact on the eavesdropper through an optimal control problem, optimizing the orientation pointwise and the position through the UAV's control input. Simulations show how this coordinated beamforming and control scheme enables directional GPS denial while guaranteeing zero interference towards a friendly direction.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Robust and Reliable Designs Using the Compromise Decision Support Problem: A Case Study in Hot Rod Rolling Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Design under uncertainty is a challenging problem, as a systems performance can be highly sensitive to variations in input parameters and model uncertainty. A conventional approach to addressing such problems is robust optimization, which seeks to enhance design performance by reducing sensitivity to uncertainty. Alternatively, reliability-based design focuses on optimizing performance while ensuring that failure constraints are satisfied with a specified probability. While both methods are well established, their integration into multi-objective and multi-stakeholder decision-making frameworks remains a challenging problem. In this study, we extend the Compromise Decision Support Problem (cDSP) framework to incorporate reliability-based design considerations and evaluate its performance in comparison to the conventional robust-based cDSP formulation. The developed framework has been validated on a multidisciplinary hot rod rolling process including parametric and model uncertainties. The results compare the predicted performance under robust and reliable scenarios, validating the efficiency of the approach in managing uncertainties for complex, multidisciplinary systems. Specifically, we found that the two methods exhibit markedly different performance when the predicted performance follows a non-normal distribution, a situation that arises in non-linear systems with parametric uncertainty. Based on this insight, we offer guidance to designers on the conditions under which each method is most appropriate.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Uncertainty Disclosure for Facilitating Enhanced Energy Storage Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving uncertainty disclosure framework, enabling system operators to release marginal value function bounds to reduce the conservativeness of interval forecast and mitigate excessive withholding, thereby enhancing storage dispatch and social welfare. We develop a risk-averse storage arbitrage model based on stochastic dynamic programming, explicitly accounting for uncertainty intervals in value function training. Real-time marginal value function bounds are derived using a rolling-horizon chance-constrained economic dispatch formulation. We rigorously prove that the bounds reliably cap the true opportunity cost and dynamically converge to the hindsight value. We verify that both the marginal value function and its bounds monotonically decrease with the state of charge (SoC) and increase with uncertainty, providing a theoretical basis for risk-averse strategic behaviors and SoC-dependent designs. An adjusted storage dispatch algorithm is further designed using these bounds. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via an agent-based simulation on the ISO-NE test system. Under 50% renewable capacity and 35% storage capacity, the proposed bounds enhance storage response by 38.91% and reduce the optimality gap to 3.91% through improved interval predictions. Additionally, by mitigating excessive withholding, the bounds yield an average system cost reduction of 0.23% and an average storage profit increase of 13.22%. These benefits further scale with higher prediction conservativeness, storage capacity, and system uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Dynamic traversal of large gaps by insects and legged robots reveals a template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.02526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that animals can use neural and sensory feedback via vision, tactile sensing, and echolocation to negotiate obstacles. Similarly, most robots use deliberate or reactive planning to avoid obstacles, which relies on prior knowledge or high-fidelity sensing of the environment. However, during dynamic locomotion in complex, novel, 3-D terrains such as forest floor and building rubble, sensing and planning suffer bandwidth limitation and large noise and are sometimes even impossible. Here, we study rapid locomotion over a large gap, a simple, ubiquitous obstacle, to begin to discover general principles of dynamic traversal of large 3-D obstacles. We challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to traverse a large gap of varying length. Both the animal and the robot could dynamically traverse a gap as large as 1 body length by bridging the gap with its head, but traversal probability decreased with gap length. Based on these observations, we developed a template that well captured body dynamics and quantitatively predicted traversal performance. Our template revealed that high approach speed, initial body pitch, and initial body pitch angular velocity facilitated dynamic traversal, and successfully predicted a new strategy of using body pitch control that increased the robot maximal traversal gap length by 50%. Our study established the first template of dynamic locomotion beyond planar surfaces and is an important step in expanding terradynamics into complex 3-D terrains.</description>

      <title>Robotic modeling of snake traversing large, smooth obstacles reveals stability benefits of body compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.09711v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Although their locomotion on flat surfaces using planar gaits is inherently stable, when snakes deform their body out of plane to traverse complex terrain, maintaining stability becomes a challenge. On trees and desert dunes, snakes grip branches or brace against depressed sand for stability. However, how they stably surmount obstacles like boulders too large and smooth to gain such anchor points is less understood. Similarly, snake robots are challenged to stably traverse large, smooth obstacles for search and rescue and building inspection. Our recent study discovered that snakes combine body lateral undulation and cantilevering to stably traverse large steps. Here, we developed a snake robot with this gait and snake-like anisotropic friction and used it as a physical model to understand stability principles. The robot traversed steps as high as a third of its body length rapidly and stably. However, on higher steps, it was more likely to fail due to more frequent rolling and flipping over, which was absent in the snake with a compliant body. Adding body compliance reduced the robot roll instability by statistically improving surface contact, without reducing speed. Besides advancing understanding of snake locomotion, our robot achieved high traversal speed surpassing most previous snake robots and approaching snakes, while maintaining high traversal probability.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Distributed Optimization via Aggregative Tracking and Deep-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel distributed data-driven optimization scheme. In detail, we focus on the so-called aggregative framework, a scenario in which a set of agents aim to cooperatively minimize the sum of local costs, each depending on both local decision variables and an aggregation of all of them. We consider a data-driven setup where each objective function is unknown and can be sampled at a single point per iteration (thanks to, e.g., feedback from users or sensors). We address this scenario through a distributed algorithm combining three components: (i) a learning part leveraging neural networks to learn the local costs descent direction, (ii) an optimization routine steering the estimates according to the learned direction to minimize the global cost, and (iii) a tracking mechanism locally reconstructing the unavailable global quantities. Using tools from system theory, i.e., timescale separation and averaging theory, we formally prove that in strongly convex setups, the distributed scheme linearly converges to a neighborhood of the optimum, whose radius depends on the accuracy of the neural networks. Finally, numerical simulations validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability - ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability - together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled allocations of water and transportation resources.</description>

      <title>Fluidically Innervated Lattices Make Versatile and Durable Tactile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation, transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior, demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for versatile robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Nominal Evaluation Of Automatic Multi-Sections Control Potential In Comparison To A Simpler One- Or Two-Sections Alternative With Predictive Spray Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Section Control (ASC) is a long-standing trend for spraying in agriculture. It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to (i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii) to dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray nozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not possible without sensors for accurate positioning data. Spraying and the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In addition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, etc. In view of this complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist. Therefore, ASC is compared to a proposed simpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching. The comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is intrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic. Combinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as 3 sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by controlling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with the same control signal as one single section. Methods are evaluated on 10 diverse real-world field examples, including non-convex field contours, freeform mainfield lanes and multiple obstacle areas. An economic cost analysis is provided to compare the methods. A preferred method is suggested that (i) minimises area coverage pathlength, (ii) offers intermediate overlap, (iii) is suitable for manual driving by following a pre-planned predictive spray switching logic for an area coverage path plan, and (iv) and in contrast to ASC can be implemented sensor-free and at low cost. Surprisingly strong economic arguments are found to not recommend ASC for small farms.</description>

      <title>Learning AC Power Flow Solutions using a Data-Dependent Variational Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Uncertain Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) requires planning under partial observability, where parking spot availability evolves as dynamic agents enter and exit spots. Existing approaches either rely only on instantaneous spot availability or make static assumptions, thereby limiting foresight and adaptability. We propose an approach that estimates probability of future spot occupancy by distinguishing initially vacant and occupied spots while leveraging nearby dynamic agent motion. We propose a probabilistic estimator that integrates partial, noisy observations from a limited Field-of-View, with the evolving uncertainty of unobserved spots. Coupled with the estimator, we design a strategy planner that balances goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on information gain, and incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency and trajectory smoothness over existing approaches, while maintaining safety margins.</description>

      <title>TeraSim-World: Worldwide Safety-Critical Data Synthesis for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe and scalable deployment of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving requires extensive and diverse data, particularly safety-critical events. Existing data are mostly generated from simulators with a significant sim-to-real gap or collected from on-road testing that is costly and unsafe. This paper presents TeraSim-World, an automated pipeline that synthesizes realistic and geographically diverse safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at anywhere in the world. Starting from an arbitrary location, TeraSim-World retrieves real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial data sources. Then, it simulates agent behaviors from naturalistic driving datasets, and orchestrates diverse adversities to create corner cases. Informed by street views of the same location, it achieves photorealistic, geographically grounded sensor rendering via the frontier video generation model Cosmos-Drive. By bridging agent and sensor simulations, TeraSim-World provides a scalable and critical data synthesis framework for training and evaluation of E2E autonomous driving systems.

      <title>Rich Vehicle Routing Problem in Disaster Management enabling Temporally-causal Transhipments across Multi-Modal Transportation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rich vehicle routing problem is considered, allowing multiple trips of heterogeneous vehicles stationed at geographically distributed vehicle depots having access to different modes of transportation. The problem arises from the real-world requirement of optimizing the disaster response time by minimizing the makespan of vehicular routes. Multiple diversely-functional vertices are considered, including Transhipment Ports as inter-modal resource transfer stations. Both simultaneous and split pickup and delivery are considered, for multiple cargo types, along with Vehicle-Cargo and Transhipment Port-Cargo compatibilities. The superiority of the proposed cascaded minimization approach is demonstrated over the existing makespan minimization approaches through our developed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation. To solve the problem quickly for practical implementation in a Disaster Management-specific Decision Support System, an extensive Heuristic Algorithm is devised which utilizes Decision Tree based structuring of possible routes; the Decision Tree approach helps to inherently capture the compatibility issues, while also explore the solution space through stochastic weights. Preferential generation of small route elements is performed, which are integrated into route clusters; we consider multiple different logical integration approaches, as well as shuffling the logics to simultaneously produce multiple independent solutions. Finally, perturbations of the different solutions are done to find better neighbouring solutions. The computational performance of the PSR-GIP Heuristic, on our created novel datasets, indicates that it is able to give good solutions swiftly for practical problems involving large integer instances that the MILP is unable to solve.</description>
