      <title>Strong LensIng and Cluster Evolution (SLICE) with JWST: Early Results, Lens Models, and High-Redshift Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage JWST's superb resolution to derive strong lensing mass maps of 14 clusters, spanning a redshift range of $z\sim0.25 - 1.06$ and a mass range of $M_{500}\sim2-12 \times 10^{14}M_\odot$, from the Strong LensIng and Cluster Evolution (SLICE) JWST program. These clusters represent a small subsample of the first clusters observed in the SLICE program that are chosen based on the detection of new multiple image constraints in the SLICE-JWST NIRCam/F150W2 and F322W2 imaging. These constraints include new lensed dusty galaxies and new substructures in previously identified lensed background galaxies. Four clusters have never been modeled before. For the remaining 10 clusters, we present updated models based on JWST and HST imaging and, where available, ground-based spectroscopy. We model the global mass profile for each cluster and report the mass enclosed within 200 and 500 kpc. We report the number of new systems identified in the JWST imaging, which in one cluster is as high as 19 new systems. The addition of new lensing systems and constraints from substructure clumps in lensed galaxies improves the ability of strong lensing models to accurately reproduce the interior mass distribution of each cluster. We also report the discovery of a candidate transient in a lensed image of the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0516-5755. All lens models and their associated products are available for download at the Strong Lensing Cluster Atlas Data Base, which is hosted at Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille.</description>

      <title>Local patch analysis of ACT DR6 convergence map using morphological statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a comprehensive hierarchical multi-scale morphological analysis to search for anomalous behaviour in the large scale matter distribution using convergence map provided by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6. We use a suite of morphological statistics consisting of Minkowski functionals, contour Minkowski tensor and Betti numbers for the analysis, and compute their deviations from the ensemble expectations and median values obtained from isotropic $\Lambda$CDM simulations provided by ACT. To assess the statistical significance of these deviations, we devise a general methodology based on the persistence of the deviations across threshold ranges and spatial resolutions, while taking into account correlations among the statistics. From the analysis of the full dataset, and hemispherical regions, we find consistency with isotropic $\Lambda$CDM simulations provided by ACT. Since deviations in smaller sky regions tend to get washed out when averaged over larger regions, we further analyze smaller sky patches. This localized analysis reveals some patches that exhibit statistically significant deviations which we refer to as 'anomalous'. We find that near the CMB cold spot, both the positive and negative density fluctuations are anomalous, at 99% CL and 95% CL respectively. This region also encompasses an anomalous southern spot previously identified in Planck CMB temperature data. We also carry out a comparison of anomalous patches identified here for ACT data with a previous analysis of the convergence map from Planck. We do not find common patches between the two datasets, which suggest that the anomalous behavior of the Planck data arises from noise in the map. Further investigation of the atypical patches using large scale structure surveys is warranted to determine their physical origin.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Primordial Black Hole Reheating in Upcoming Interferometry Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects of detecting a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from the primordial black hole (PBH) reheating epoch. If PBHs form during a non-standard cosmological phase prior to the radiation-dominated era, they can dominate the energy density of the Universe before evaporating via Hawking radiation. Such PBHs can generate induced GWs that may fall within the detectable range of future interferometry missions: (i) through isocurvature perturbations arising from the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) through the amplification of adiabatic perturbations triggered by the abrupt transition from PBH domination to radiation domination. We assess the detection prospects of such GW spectra using the signal-to-noise ratio, Fisher forecast analysis, and Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis with mock data from LISA and ET. Our findings reveal that ET exhibits superior sensitivity to both isocurvature- and adiabatic-induced GWs, covering a wide PBH mass range of $M_{\rm in} \in (0.5-4\times 10^7)$ g. However, we find that the relative uncertainties associated with the parameter of the isocurvature source are quite high. LISA, by contrast, is mostly sensitive to the adiabatic source, with $M_{\rm in} \in (2\times10^4-5\times 10^8)$ g. The combined effect of adiabatic and isocurvature sources on ET and LISA provides a multi-stage window into the post-inflationary Universe by constraining PBH mass, energy fraction, and the background equation of state.</description>

      <title>Generalized Nonextensive Entropy Holographic Dark Energy Models Verified by Cosmological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for studying generalized Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) models in which we use a dimensionless form of the area-entropy of cosmological horizons. The future event horizon is applied though the formalism can also be applied to any other type of the horizon, too. Then, we use our formalism for nonextensive horizon entropies of standard HDE (i.e. Bekenstein-Hawking), and generalized such as Barrow/Tsallis-Cirto, R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Kaniadakis as dark energy models of the universe and test them by cosmological data.
  We find the bounds on the specific entropy model parameters and also apply statistical comparison tool such as the Bayesian evidence criterion in order to favour or disfavour the models against standard $\Lambda$CDM.
  The main data test results are that all the HDE models under study are statistically disfavoured with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, though at some different levels. The standard HDE seem to be on the same footing as R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Kaniadakis HDE models since the latter include only small deviations from HDE model resulting from the series expansion of their extra nonextensivity parameters. However, Barrow and Tsallis-Cirto models, though still disfavoured against $\Lambda$CDM, seem to point out observationally to fulfil an important physical property of extensivity (though still remaining nonadditive) which is in agreement with our previous results of Refs. \cite{Dabrowski:2020atl,PhysRevD.108.103533} and recent claims of Ref. \cite{TSALLIS2025139238}. Finally, the Tsallis-Cirto model parameter is pointing towards the $\Lambda$CDM limit which is singular also at the expense of having much larger value of the holographic dark energy dimensionless parameter $k$ value higher than other models.</description>

      <title>Environmental Effects on Hubble Constant Measurements from Gravitational Wave Observations: A Case Study of the GW190514-GW190521 Hierarchical Triple Merger inside AGN J124942.3+344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of environmental effects on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole mergers residing in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) near the central supermassive black hole. Using the potential hierarchical triple merger candidate GW190514-GW190521 in AGN J124942.3+344929 with its electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr as a multimessenger case study, we demonstrate that environmental effects can be negligible for mergers at approximately tens to hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole. We find $H_0=40.9_{-8.9}^{+19.3}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (median and 68\% credible interval) under a flat prior and flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Incorporating GW170817 prior information improves constraints to $H_0=68.8_{-6.0}^{+7.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We suggest that in general, AGN environments could serve as viable laboratories for cosmological studies from GW observations where environmental effects remain below detection thresholds.</description>

      <title>Accretion in very early Universe and charge asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additional elementary species and primordial black holes are common candidates for dark matter. Their co-existence in the early Universe leads to accretion if particles are heavy. We solve equation of motion affected by expansion which enhances black hole growth rates. They depend upon particles freeze-out time rather than their mass. Taking into account friction we investigate recently suggested baryogenesis mechanism operating via scattering cross-section difference between particles and antiparticles on relativistic symmetric plasma. We find that asymmetry is accumulated at relatively small times which can be used to construct viable particle models.</description>

      <title>Redshift Distributions of Fast Radio Bursts Inferred Using Clustering in Dispersion Measure Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs), millisecond-duration radio transient events, possess the potential to serve as excellent cosmological probes. The FRB redshift distribution contains information about the FRB sources, providing key constraints on the types of engines. However, it is quite challenging to obtain the FRB redshifts due to the poor localization and the faintness of the host galaxies. This reality severely restricts the application prospects and study of the physical origins of FRBs. We propose that the clustering of observed FRBs can be an effective approach to address this issue without needing to accurately model dispersion measure (DM) contributions from the host galaxy and the immediate environment of the source. Using the clustering of $5\times 10^7$ simulated FRBs from future observations with sensitivity similar to the second phase of the Square Kilometre Array, we show that in extragalactic DM space, the redshift distributions can be accurately reconstructed, and the mean redshift for FRBs between 384.8 and 1450.3 $\rm pc\,cm^{-3}$ can be constrained to $\sim\!0.001\pm0.003 (1+z)$. The results demonstrate the potential of FRB clustering to constrain redshift distributions and provide valuable insights into FRB source models and cosmological applications.</description>

      <title>Double radio relics and radio halo in the high redshift galaxy cluster El Gordo with the Upgraded GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse synchrotron radio sources associated with the intra-cluster medium of galaxy clusters are of special interest at high redshifts to understand the magnetization and particle acceleration mechanisms. El Gordo (EG) is the most massive galaxy cluster at high redshift (0.87), hosts a radio halo and a double radio relic system. We aim to understand the role of turbulence in the origin of the diffuse radio emission by combining radio and X-ray observations. We observed EG with the Upgraded GMRT at 0.3 - 1.45 GHz and obtained the integrated spectra, spatially resolved spectral map, and scaling relations between radio and X-ray surface brightness. We constructed a density fluctuation power spectrum for the central 1 Mpc region using Chandra data. The radio halo and the double relics are detected at all the bands and, in addition, we detect an extension to the eastern relic. The radio halo has a spectral index of $-1.0\pm0.3$ with a possible steepening beyond 1.45 GHz. All the relics have spectral indices of $-1.4$ except the extension of the east relic which has $-2.1\pm0.4$. The radio and X-ray surface brightness point-to-point analysis at bands 3 and 4 show slopes of $0.60\pm0.12$ and $0.76\pm0.12$, respectively. The spectral index and X-ray surface brightness show an anti-correlation. The density fluctuations peak at $\sim 700$ kpc with an amplitude of $(\delta \rho/\rho) =0.15\pm0.02$. We derive the 3D turbulent Mach number of $\sim$ 0.6 from the gas density fluctuations power spectrum, assuming all the fluctuations are attributed to turbulence. The derived properties of EG are in line with the low redshift clusters indicating that fast magnetic amplification proposed in high redshift clusters is at work in EG as well. We have discussed the consistency of the obtained results with the turbulent re-acceleration which might be representative of high redshift merging clusters.</description>

      <title>Scale and redshift dependent limits on cosmic neutrino properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological neutrino mass and abundance measurements are reaching unprecedented precision. Testing their stability versus redshift and scale is a crucial issue, as it can serve as a guide for optimizing ongoing and future searches. Here, we perform such analyses, considering a number of redshift, scale, and redshift-and-scale nodes. Concerning the $k$-space analysis of $\sum m_\nu$, CMB observations are crucial, as they lead the neutrino mass constraints. Interestingly, some data combinations suggest a non-zero value for the neutrino mass with $2\sigma$ significance. The most constraining bound we find is $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.54$ eV at $95\%$ CL in the $[10^{-3}, 10^{-2}]$ $h$/Mpc $k$-bin, a limit that barely depends on the data combination. Regarding the redshift- and scale-dependent neutrino mass constraints, high redshifts ($z&gt;100$) and scales in the range $[10^{-3}, 10^{-1}]$ $h$/Mpc provide the best constraints. The least constraining bounds are obtained at very low redshifts $[0,0.5]$ and also at very small scales ($k&gt;0.1\, h$/Mpc), due to the absence of observations. Highly relevant is the case of the $[100, 1100]$, $[10^{-2}, 10^{-1}]$ $h$/Mpc redshift-scale bin, where a $2$-$3\sigma$ evidence for a non-zero neutrino mass is obtained for all data combinations. The bound from CMB alone at $68\%$ CL is $0.63^{+0.20}_{-0.24}$ eV, and the one for the full dataset is $0.56^{+0.20}_{-0.23}$ eV, clearly suggesting a non-zero neutrino mass at these scales, possibly related to a deviation of the ISW amplitude in this redshift range. Concerning the analysis of $N_{\rm eff}$ in the $k$-space, at intermediate scales ranging from $k=10^{-3}$ $h$/Mpc to $k=10^{-1}$ $h$/Mpc, accurate CMB data provide very strong bounds, the most robust one being $N_{\rm eff}=3.09\pm 0.14$, comparable to the standard expected value without a $k$-bin analysis.

      <title>Systematic bias in dark siren statistical methods and its impact on Hubble constant measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the multimessenger cosmology marked by the detection of GW170817, gravitational waves from compact objects at cosmological distances demonstrated Standard Sirens as a relevant cosmological probe. In the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart identification, GWs carry valuable information through the dark siren approach, where the source redshift is estimated using galaxy catalogs of potential hosts within the localization volume. However, the dark siren analysis can be affected by galaxy catalog incompleteness at the limits of gravitational-wave detectability, potentially introducing biases in the constraints on cosmological parameters. Focusing on GWs from binary black holes detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration, we explore the possible systematic biases in the measurement of the Hubble constant. These biases may arise from 1) the incompleteness of catalogs due to the apparent magnitude thresholds of optical telescope sensitivity, and 2) the use of incorrect weighting schemes (using star formation or stellar mass as tracers of the host galaxy) for each potential host. We found that an unbiased estimate of $H_0$ can be obtained when the corrected weighting scheme is applied to a complete or volume-limited catalog. The results using stellar mass as a tracer indicate that a percent-level measurement of $H_0$, with a precision of approximately 3%, can be achieved with 100 binary black hole detections by the LVK at O4 and O5 sensitivity. The O5 run provides a slight improvement, reducing the $H_0$ uncertainty by 0.07 km/s/Mpc compared to the O4-like configuration. This precision is achievable by using a complete galaxy catalog that covers the 90% of the localisation probability for each GW detection, with A$_{90\%}$&lt;10 deg$^2$. The $H_0$ precision increases to approximately 6% when it is assumed that every galaxy has an equal probability of being the host.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Cosmic Birefringence and DESI Data with Evolving Axion in $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have revealed growing tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including indications of isotropic cosmic birefringence and deviations from $w = -1$ in the dark energy equation of state, as suggested by DESI and supernova measurements. In this paper, we point out that such deviations can arise even from a subdominant energy density component. We then propose a unified framework based on a dynamical axion field that simultaneously accounts for both anomalies, providing a simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In our scenario, the axion field with $2H_0\lesssim m\lesssim 6H_0$, where $H_0$ is the current Hubble constant, induces a nonzero rotation of the CMB polarization plane and modifies the present-day dark energy equation of state. This framework accommodates recent observational data with natural parameter choices, even for a string axion with a decay constant of order $10^{17}\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Multimodality in the search for new physics in pulsar timing data and the case of kination-amplified gravitational-wave background from inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave background (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in the expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field, characterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB model, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and EPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the ordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the likelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the free spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher signal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock spectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr (NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first time while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current NG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal posteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is $B\equiv Z_\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\mathrm{KA}=2.9\pm1.9$, indicating comparable statistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical model-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor spectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial spectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer measurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by the multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.</description>

      <title>How do Massive Primordial Black Holes Impact the Formation of the First Stars and Galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of massive primordial black holes (PBHs; $m_{\rm BH}\sim 10^6~M_{\odot}$) on the star formation and first galaxy assembly process using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations from $z = 1100$ to $z \sim 9$. We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing mass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by seeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong feedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the presence of baryon-dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH location and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more efficient star formation compared to standard $\Lambda$CDM. By $z \sim 10$, PBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios comparable to observed high-$z$ AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as viable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that PBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered overmassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of BH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels. Future studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and radio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in distinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.</description>

      <title>Stochastic origin of primordial fluctuations in the Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a study of the effects of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalisation of stochastic inflation on the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a model-independent single-field context. We demonstrate how the scalar perturbations' Infra-Red (IR) contributions and the emerging Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution characterise the Langevin equations for the ``soft" modes in the quasi-de Sitter background. Both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion-dominated regimes undergo a specific analysis of the distribution function using the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism, which helps us to evade a no-go theorem on the PBH mass. Using the EFT-induced alterations, we evaluate the local non-Gaussian parameters in the drift-dominated limit.</description>

      <title>Indication of the electron-to-proton mass ratio variation within the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near (~100 pc) and far (~8.7 kpc) relative to the Galactic center, the molecular clouds SgrB2(N) and Orion-KL exhibit different values of the fundamental physical constant mu=m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio. Measured frequency difference between the emission lines of methanol (CH3OH), - J_K_u - J_K_l = 6_3 - 5_2 A+ 542000.981 MHz, 6_3 - 5_2 A- 542081.936 MHz, and 8_0 - 7_-1 E 543076.194 MHz, - observed with the space observatory Herschel toward SgrB2(N) and Orion-KL corresponds to (Sgr-Ori): Delta mu/mu = (-3.7 +/- 0.5)*10^(-7) (1 sigma C.L.). At the same time, comparison of the same methanol lines in Orion-KL with laboratory frequencies shows no significant changes in mu (Ori-lab): Delta mu/mu = (-0.5 +/- 0. 6)*10^(-7), while a comparison between SgrB2(N) and laboratory lines indicates a lower value of mu near the Galactic center (Sgr-lab): Delta mu/mu = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7). The reduced value of mu in SgrB2(N) is not explained by known systematic effects and requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inflationary phenomenology of a rescaled Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. In this framework, the gravitational constant of the Einstein-Hilbert term is rescaled due to effective terms active in the high curvature era. Basically, the total theory is an $F(R,G,\phi)$ theory with the Gauss-Bonnet part contributing only a non-minimal coupling to the scalar field, so it is a theory with string theory origins and with a non-trivial $F(R)$ gravity part. The $F(R)$ gravity part in the high curvature regime contributes only a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term and thus the resulting theory is effectively a rescaled version of a standard Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We develop the formalism of rescaled Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, taking in account the GW170817 constraints on the gravitational wave speed. We show explicitly how the rescaled theory affects directly the primordial scalar and tensor perturbations, and how the slow-roll and observational indices of inflation are affected by the rescaling of the theory. We perform a thorough phenomenological analysis of several models of interest and we show that is it possible to obtain viable inflationary theories compatible with the latest Planck data. Also among the studied models there are cases that yield a relatively large blue tilted tensor spectral index and we demonstrate that these models can lead to detectable primordial gravitational waves in the future gravitational wave experiments. Some of the scenarios examined, for specific values of the reheating temperature may be detectable by SKA, LISA, BBO, DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology Confronted with Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several models within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravities are considered with regard their late-time phenomenological viability. The models contain a non-minimally coupled scalar field and satisfy a constraint on the scalar field Gauss-Bonnet coupling, that guarantees that the speed of the tensor perturbations is equal to the speed of light. The late-time cosmological evolution of these Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models is confronted with the observational data including the Pantheon plus Type Ia supernovae catalogue, the Hubble parameter measurements (cosmic chronometers), data from cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) including the latest measurements from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Among the considered class of models some of them do not fit the CMB and BAO data. However, there exists some models that generate a viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scenario with well-behaved late-time cosmological evolution that fits the observational data essentially better in comparison to the standard $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to the use of Planck telescope data for the systematic search of ultra-bright high-redshift strongly lensed galaxies. These galaxies provide crucial insights into the early universe, particularly during phases of intense star formation. The Planck mission, despite its limited angular resolution, offers a unique opportunity to identify candidate strongly lensed galaxies over a wide area of the sky. This work outlines the methodology used to identify these rare objects, the challenges encountered, and the preliminary results obtained from follow-up observations with higher-resolution instruments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Collaboration presented evidence that the equation of state $w$ of the dark energy is varying, or $w \simeq -0.948$ if it is constant. In either case, the dark energy cannot be due to a cosmological constant alone. Here we introduce an ultralight axion (or axion-like particle) with mass $m_\phi \simeq 2 \times 10^{-33}$ eV that has properties that can explain the new $w$ measurement. In particular, $w\ge -1$ in this model, ruling out the $w &lt; -1$ region allowed by the DES data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Resonant Transitions of Tidally Perturbed Gravitational Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light bosons can form gravitational atoms (GA) around spinning black holes through the superradiance process.Considering the black hole to be part of a binary system,the tidal potential of the companion periodically perturbs the GA such that an atomic transition occurs between two of its energy eigenstates.The resonant transition is modeled by the Landau-Zener system,where the orbital frequency of the companion determines the relevant transition.In this work, we study a novel gravitational wave signal originating directly from the atomic transition of the GA in a binary system.We derive the analytical formulae of both the strain waveform and frequency spectrum of the signal.We further present the GA-binary systems that can have a large signal-to-noise ratio in LISA's frequency band.Finally, we discuss the implications of detection of the signal:inferring model parameters,including the boson mass and black hole spin,and computing the phase shift and Doppler shift of the gravitational wave signal for equal mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Isotropic cosmic birefringence from string axion domain walls without cosmic strings, and DESI results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 results showed a preference for isotropic cosmic birefringence, which is consistent with the previous analyses using the Planck and WMAP data. Independently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results further support that dark energy is evolving over the history of the universe, enhancing the possibility of new physics in the late-time universe. In this paper, we propose that if domain walls associated with the string axion are formed, the isotropic cosmic birefringence can be explained naturally. Interestingly, avoiding the domain wall problem, the domain wall formation is predicted to be much later than the epoch of recombination. Compared with the previous proposal of kilobyte cosmic birefringence, where domain wall formation occurs before recombination, the predicted rotation angle, $\beta \approx 0.21 c_\gamma$ deg with the anomaly coefficient $c_\gamma \approx 1$, does not suffer from the ambiguity of the population bias. The prediction is in excellent agreement with the ACT (and combined) data regarding cosmic birefringence. This scenario can be probed from the anisotropic birefringence for the photons emitted well after the recombination and the gravitational waves. In addition, the late-time dynamics of the axion contributes to the dark energy component, and we also study the relation to the DESI results.</description>

Abstract: Modern cosmological theories invoke the idea that all structure in the Universe originates from quantum fluctuations. Understanding the quantum-to-classical transition for these fluctuations is of central importance not only for the foundations of quantum theory, but also for observational astronomy. In my contribution, I review the essential features of this transition, emphasizing in particular the role of Alexei Starobinsky.</description>

      <title>Loops in inflation with strongly non-geodesic motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study loop corrections in the effective field theory of inflation with imaginary speed of sound, which has been shown to provide an effective description of multi-field inflationary models characterized by strongly non-geodesic motion and heavy entropic perturbations. We focus on the one-loop corrections to the scalar and tensor power spectra, taking into account all relevant vertices at leading order in derivatives and in slow-roll. We find a power-law dependence of the scalar two-point function on the scale that defines the range of validity of the effective theory, analogous to the enhancement observed in tree-level correlation functions. Even more dramatic, the relative correction to the tensor spectrum is exponentially enhanced, albeit also suppressed in the slow-roll limit. In spite of these large effects, our results show that this class of models can satisfy the requirement of perturbative control and a consistent loop expansion within a range of parameters of phenomenological interest. On the other hand, models predicting large values of the power spectrum on small scales are found to be under strong tension. As a technical bonus, we carefully explain the prescription for the regularization and manipulation of loop integrals in this set-up, where one has a non-trivial domain of integration for time and momentum integrals owing to the regime of validity of the effective field theory. This procedure is general enough to be of potential applicability in other contexts.</description>

      <title>No-scale Brans-Dicke Gravity -- ultralight scalar boson &amp; heavy inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is very much intriguing if the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is not a fundamental parameter. The Brans-Dicke gravity is nothing but the theory where the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is indeed an illusional parameter. The theory predicts a massless scalar boson whose exchanges between matters induce unwanted long range forces. We solve this problem imposing there is no dimensionful parameter in the theory, even at the quantum level. We further extend the theory by including a $R^2$ term and a non-minimal coupling of the Standard Model Higgs to gravity, as their coefficients are dimensionless. This extension provides a heavy inflaton field that is consistent with all cosmological observations, with a potential very similar to that of the Starobinsky model. The inflaton necessarily decays into the massless scalar bosons, resulting in a non-negligible amount of dark radiation in the present universe. We demonstrate that the inflation model yields a sufficiently high reheating temperature for successful leptogenesis, and we also discuss a possible candidate for dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We show for the first time that warm inflation is feasible with Standard Model (SM) gauge interactions alone. Our model consists of a minimal extension of the SM by a single scalar inflaton field with an axion-like coupling to gluons and a monomial potential. The effects of light fermions, which were previously argued to render warm inflation with the SM impossible, are alleviated by Hubble dilution of their chiral chemical potentials. Our model only features one adjustable combination of parameters and accommodates all inflationary observables. We briefly discuss implications for axion experiments, dark matter, and the strong CP-problem.</description>

      <title>Beyond the first galaxies primordial black holes shine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of nine candidate galaxies at $z=17$ and $z=25$ discovered by the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} in relatively small sky areas, if confirmed, is virtually impossible to reconcile with current galaxy formation model predictions. We show here that the implied UV luminosity density can be produced by a population of primordial black holes (PBH) of mass $M_{\rm PBH} = 10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ residing in low-mass halos ($M_h \approx 10^{7} \, M_{\odot}$), and accreting at a moderate fraction of the Eddington luminosity, $\lambda_E \simeq 0.36$. These sources precede the first significant episodes of cosmic star formation. At later times, as star formation is ignited, PBH emission becomes comparable or subdominant with respect to the galactic one. Such a PBH+galaxy scenario reconciles the evolution of the UV LF from $z=25$ to $z=11$. If ultra-early sources are purely powered by accretion, this strongly disfavours seed production mechanisms requiring the presence of stars (massive/Pop III stars or clusters) or their UV radiation (direct collapse BHs), leaving PBH as the only alternative solution available so far. Alternative explanations, such as isolated, large clusters ($\approx 10^7 \, M_{\odot}$) of massive ($m_\star =10^3 M_{\odot}$) of Pop III are marginally viable, but require extreme and unlikely conditions, that can be probed via UV/FIR emission lines or gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>LiteBIRD Science Goals and Forecasts. A Case Study of the Origin of Primordial Gravitational Waves using Large-Scale CMB Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of using the $LiteBIRD$ satellite $B$-mode survey to constrain models of inflation producing specific features in CMB angular power spectra. We explore a particular model example, i.e. spectator axion-SU(2) gauge field inflation. This model can source parity-violating gravitational waves from the amplification of gauge field fluctuations driven by a pseudoscalar "axionlike" field, rolling for a few e-folds during inflation. The sourced gravitational waves can exceed the vacuum contribution at reionization bump scales by about an order of magnitude and can be comparable to the vacuum contribution at recombination bump scales. We argue that a satellite mission with full sky coverage and access to the reionization bump scales is necessary to understand the origin of the primordial gravitational wave signal and distinguish among two production mechanisms: quantum vacuum fluctuations of spacetime and matter sources during inflation. We present the expected constraints on model parameters from $LiteBIRD$ satellite simulations, which complement and expand previous studies in the literature. We find that $LiteBIRD$ will be able to exclude with high significance standard single-field slow-roll models, such as the Starobinsky model, if the true model is the axion-SU(2) model with a feature at CMB scales. We further investigate the possibility of using the parity-violating signature of the model, such as the $TB$ and $EB$ angular power spectra, to disentangle it from the standard single-field slow-roll scenario. We find that most of the discriminating power of $LiteBIRD$ will reside in $BB$ angular power spectra rather than in $TB$ and $EB$ correlations.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology from a type-II minimally modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have successfully integrated $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, a promising model for alleviating cosmological tensions, into a theoretical framework by endowing it with a specific Lagrangian from the VCDM model, a type-II minimally modified gravity. In this theory, we demonstrate that an auxiliary scalar field with a linear potential induces an effective cosmological constant, enabling the realization of an abrupt mirror AdS-dS transition in the late universe through a piecewise linear potential. To eliminate the sudden singularity in this setup and ensure stable transitions, we smooth out this potential. Realized within the VCDM theory, the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model facilitates two types of rapid smooth mirror AdS-dS transitions: (i) the agitated transition, associated with a smooth jump in the potential, where $\Lambda_{\rm s}$, and consequently $H$, exhibits a bump around the transition's midpoint; and (ii) the quiescent transition, associated with a smooth change in the slope of the potential, where $\Lambda_{\rm s}$ transitions gracefully. These transitions are likely to leave distinct imprints on the background and perturbation dynamics, potentially allowing the observational data to distinguish between them. This novel theoretical framework propels $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM into a fully predictive model capable of exploring the evolution of the Universe including the late-time AdS-dS transition epoch, and extends the applicability of the model. We believe further research is crucial in establishing $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM as a leading candidate or guide for a new concordance cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Effects of dynamical friction on perturbations for evolving dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of dynamical friction on scales where the linear growth factor and the spherical collapse model can be applied and show its influence on the evolution of perturbations. In particular, considering smooth and clustering dark energy models, we describe the role played by friction by selecting two main hierarchical models, i.e., the first where the friction term is proportional to the Hubble rate, whereas the second where friction is induced by the dark energy pressure. The second approach generalises the first and translates the idea that pressure is a general relativistic effect, motivating why friction might arise once barotropic dark energy fluids are considered. The corresponding effects of friction are investigated at the level of linear and nonlinear perturbations, using the formalism of the spherical collapse model. Whilst dynamical friction has very small effects and thus it cannot be excluded a priori, dissipative pressure friction leads to a substantial slow down in the evolution of perturbations. This can be inferred particularly from the halo mass function, for which we also employ corrections due to dark energy clustering. To this end, in order to discern detectable deviations from the standard cosmological model, we thus highlight where dissipation effects might play a significant role at large scales.</description>

      <title>Nanohertz gravitational waves from a quasar-based supermassive black hole binary population model as dark sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have detected evidence of the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, providing confidence in detecting individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the future. Nanohertz GWs emitted by inspiraling SMBHBs encode the luminosity distances of SMBHBs. They can serve as dark sirens to explore the cosmic expansion history via a statistical method to obtain the redshift information of GW sources' host galaxies using galaxy catalogs. The theoretical analysis of the dark siren method relies on the modeling of the population of SMBHBs. Using a population model consistent with the latest SGWB observations is essential, as the SGWB provides significant information about the distribution of SMBHBs. In this work, we employ a quasar-based model, which can self-consistently account for the SGWB amplitude, to estimate the population of SMBHBs. We constrain the Hubble constant using the mock GW data from different detection cases of PTAs in the future. Our results show that a PTA consisting of 100 pulsars with a white noise level of 20 ns could measure the Hubble constant with a precision close to $1\%$ over a 10-year observation period, and a PTA with 200 pulsars may achieve this goal over a 5-year observation period. The results indicate that modeling the SMBHB population significantly influences the analysis of dark sirens, and SMBHB dark sirens have the potential to be developed as a valuable cosmological probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induced by primordial perturbations serve as crucial probes for studying the early universe, providing a significant window into potential new physics during cosmic evolution. Due to the potentially large amplitudes of primordial perturbations on small scales, the contributions of high-order cosmological perturbations are highly significant. We propose a vertex approach applicable to the study of induced gravitational waves for arbitrary higher orders. Using the vertex approach and tree diagrams, we can directly derive the explicit expressions of higher-order induced gravitational waves without involving the complex and lengthy calculations of higher-order cosmological perturbations. Correlations between different tree diagrams correspond to the loop diagrams of two-point correlation functions of induced gravitational waves. Our investigation reveals that one-particle reducible diagrams impact tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves while leaving scalar induced gravitational waves unaffected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard cosmological framework, neutrinos begin to free-stream after the weak interaction phase ends in the early universe, at a temperature of approximately $T \sim 1 \, {\rm MeV}$. However, the onset of neutrino free-streaming can be delayed if additional interactions occur in the early universe, leaving imprints on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) angular power spectra and the large-scale structure (LSS) matter power spectra. We present a thorough analysis of early universe neutrino interactions with a fairly generalized parameterization of the interaction rates as a power law in neutrino temperature. In this (6+2) parameter scenario, we constrain the cosmological parameters along with the free-streaming redshift and the sum of the neutrino mass in presence of such interactions, with the help of full shape (FS) galaxy power spectra from BOSS Data Release 12. Our analysis reveals that a combined dataset of FS along with CMB and BAO offers improved constraints on the free-streaming redshift from present data, comparable to the forecast results from future CMB-S4 data. Additionally, we investigate the prospects of future galaxy surveys by forecasting on Euclid mission in combination with Planck and CMB-S4, and find significant improvement on both the free-streaming redshift and the sum of the neutrino mass than the existing constraints as well as than CMB-S4 alone.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mass Modelling from Multi-Wavelength JWST Strong Lens Analysis: Dark Matter Substructure, Angular Mass Complexity, or Both?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze two galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, SPT0418-47 and SPT2147-50, using JWST NIRCam imaging across multiple filters. To account for angular complexity in the lens mass distribution, we introduce multipole perturbations with orders $m=1, 3, 4$. Our results show strong evidence for angular mass complexity in SPT2147, with multipole strengths of 0.3-1.7 $\%$ for $m=3, 4$ and 2.4-9.5 $\%$ for $m=1$, while SPT0418 shows no such preference. We also test lens models that include a dark matter substructure, finding a strong preference for a substructure in SPT2147-50 with a Bayes factor (log-evidence change) of $\sim 60$ when multipoles are not included. Including multipoles reduces the Bayes factor to $\sim 11$, still corresponding to a $5\sigma$ detection of a subhalo with an NFW mass of $\log_{10}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) = 10.87\substack{+0.53\\ -0.71}$. While SPT2147-50 may represent the fourth detection of a dark matter substructure in a strong lens, further analysis is needed to confirm that the signal is not due to systematics associated with the lens mass model.</description>

      <title>Uniting the Observed Dynamical Dark Energy Preference with the Discrepancies in $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ Across Cosmological Probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) indicate 1) potentially discrepant measurements of the matter density $\Omega_m$ and Hubble constant $ H_0 $ in $\Lambda$CDM model when analyzed individually, and 2) hints of dynamical dark energy in a $w_0w_a$CDM model when data are combined in a joint analysis. We examine whether underlying dynamical dark energy cosmologies favored by data would result in biases in $\Omega_m$ and $ H_0 $ for each probe when analyzed individually under $\Lambda$CDM. We generate mock datasets in $w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies, fit the individual probes under the $\Lambda$CDM model, and find expected biases in $\Omega_m$ are $\sim 0.03$. Notably, the $\Omega_m$ differences between probes are consistent with values observed in real datasets. We also observe that mock DESI-BAO datasets generated in the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies will lead to a biased measurement of $H_0$ higher by ($\sim1.2$km/s/Mpc) when fitted under $\Lambda$CDM, appearing to mildly improve the Hubble tension, but as the true underlying $H_0$ is lower, the tension is in fact worsened. We find that the $\Omega_m$ discrepancies, the high BAO $ H_0 $ relative to CMB, and the joint dynamical dark energy signal are all related effects that could be explained \textit{simultaneously} with either new physics or new systematics. While it is possible to unite many of the discrepancies seen in recent analyses along a single axis, our results underscore the importance of understanding systematic differences in datasets, as they have unique impacts in different cosmological parameter spaces.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a $\sim3.9\sigma$ preference for dynamical dark energy has been reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, which has inspired hot debates on new physics or systematics. In this letter, we reveal that this significant preference is dominated by an external low-redshift supernova (low-$z$ SN) sample, which was combined with the Dark Energy Survey SN program (DES-SN) in their Year-Five data release (DESY5). Using the intercept in the SN magnitude-redshift relation as a diagnostics for systematics, we find not only large dispersions but also a large discrepancy in the low-$z$ SN sample when compared to the high-$z$ DES-SN sample within the single DESY5 compilation. Correcting for this low-$z$ systematics with or without including the cosmic microwave background data can largely reduce the preference for dynamical DE to be $0.5\sim1.5\sigma$. Therefore, the DESI preference for dynamical DE might be a mirage of unknown systematics in the low-$z$ SN sample.</description>

      <title>Page Time of Primordial Black Holes in the Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time. Specifically, for initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity constraints with Planck ISW-lensing bispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on modified gravity by including the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from CMB lensing-CMB temperature cross-correlations, based on the latest Planck PR4 maps. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy approach and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we find that including the CMB ISW lensing cross-correlations tighten constraints on the modified gravity parameters by approximately $20\%$, reducing the viable parameter space by $40-80\%$. We derive constraints from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI DR1 BAO, CMB ISW-lensing, and type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data. The constraints on the EFT parameters controlling the kinetic braiding and non-minimal coupling are consistent with General Relativity (GR) at the $95\%$ CL. In the $w_0$-$w_a$ parameter space, our results imply a crossing of the phantom divide, $w=-1$. The modified gravity model shows a mild preference over $\Lambda$CDM at the $1.8\sigma$, $2.6\sigma$ and $3.2\sigma$ levels for the combinations with Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 supernova datasets. We find that using the latest $\texttt{HiLLiPoP}+\texttt{LoLLiPoP}$ likelihoods alleviates the departure of modified gravity parameters from the GR-values compared to results using {\it Planck} 2018 data. This paper underlines the importance of the ISW lensing probe in constraining late-time modifications of gravity.</description>

      <title>Hermeian haloes: extreme objects with two interactions in the past</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies based on numerical models of the Local Group predict the existence of field haloes and galaxies that have visited both the Milky Way and M31 in the past, called Hermeian haloes. We extend this analysis beyond the Local Group using two high-resolution dark matter-only N-body simulations from the MultiDark suite. We define Hermeian haloes as field haloes which had close interactions with two other more massive field haloes in the past, called targets. We find that Hermeian haloes are a more extreme example of field haloes with interactions in the past than the well-known backsplash haloes that experienced only one interaction. Compared to backsplashers, Hermeians have more concentrated density profiles and tend to occupy more overdense regions. They also have higher velocities relative to their target haloes and relative to their neighbours within 1~$h^{-1}\; \mathrm{Mpc}$. Hermeian haloes can be found around every halo in the simulation (if the resolution is sufficient) and make up 0.4 to 2.3 per cent of the total number of field haloes (for haloes more massive than $10^{10}\; h^{-1}\;\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and $3.3 \times 10^{7}\; h^{-1}\;\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, respectively), increasing to 10 per cent in overdense regions. They tend to be distributed close to the line connecting their targets, which may help to identify Hermeian haloes in observations. We also identify Local Group analogues in the simulation and find that about one-third (15 out of 49) of them contain Hermeian haloes if the distance between the two main haloes is below 1~$h^{-1} \;\mathrm{Mpc}$.</description>

      <title>DUALZ: Deep UNCOVER-ALMA Legacy High-Z Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the survey design and initial results of the ALMA Cycle 9 program of DUALZ, which aims to establish a joint ALMA and JWST public legacy field targeting the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744. DUALZ features a contiguous $4'\times6'$ ALMA 30-GHz-wide mosaic in Band 6, covering areas of $\mu&gt;2$ down to a sensitivity of $\sigma=32.7~\mu$Jy. Through a blind search, we identified 69 dust continuum sources at S/N $\gtrsim5.0$ with median redshift and intrinsic 1.2-mm flux of $z=2.30$ and $S_{\rm 1.2mm}^{\rm int}=0.24$~mJy. Of these, 27 have been spectroscopically confirmed, leveraged by the latest NIRSpec observations, while photometric redshift estimates are constrained by the comprehensive HST, NIRCam, and ALMA data for the remaining sources. With priors, we further identify a [CII]158 $\mu$m line emitter at $z=6.3254\pm0.0004$, confirmed by the latest NIRSpec spectroscopy. The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2-mm continuum exhibit undisturbed morphologies, denoted either by disk or spheroid, implying the triggers for the faint mm emission are less catastrophic than mergers. We have identified 8 HST-dark galaxies (F150W$&gt;$27mag, F150W$-$F444W$&gt;$2.3) and 2 JWST-dark (F444W$&gt;$30mag) galaxy candidates among the ALMA continuum sources. The former includes face-on disk galaxies, hinting that substantial dust obscuration does not always result from inclination. We also detect a marginal dust emission from an X-ray-detected galaxy at $z_{\rm spec}=10.07$, suggesting an active co-evolution of the central black hole and its host. We assess the infrared luminosity function up to $z\sim10$ and find it consistent with predictions from galaxy formation models. To foster diverse scientific outcomes from the community, we publicly release reduced ALMA mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog.</description>

      <title>An Axion Pulsarscope</title>

Abstract: Electromagnetic fields surrounding pulsars may source coherent ultralight axion signals at the known rotational frequencies of the neutron stars, which can be detected by laboratory experiments (e.g., pulsarscopes). As a promising case study, we model axion emission from the well-studied Crab pulsar, which would yield a prominent signal at $f \approx 29.6$ Hz regardless of whether the axion contributes to the dark matter abundance. We estimate the relevant sensitivity of future axion dark matter detection experiments such as DMRadio-GUT, Dark SRF, and CASPEr, assuming different magnetosphere models to bracket the uncertainty in astrophysical modeling. For example, depending on final experimental parameters, the Dark SRF experiment could probe axions with any mass $m_a \ll 10^{-13}$ eV down to $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ with one year of data and assuming the vacuum magnetosphere model. These projected sensitivities may be degraded depending on the extent to which the magnetosphere is screened by charge-filled plasma. The promise of pulsar-sourced axions as a clean target for direct detection experiments motivates dedicated simulations of axion production in pulsar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>First Search for High-Energy Neutrino Emission from Galaxy Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exact sources of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory still remain a mystery. For the first time, this work explores the hypothesis that galaxy mergers may serve as sources for these high-energy neutrinos. Galaxy mergers can host very high-energy hadronic and photohadronic processes, which may produce very high-energy neutrinos. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis utilizing the galaxy merger data from six catalogs and 10 years of public IceCube muon-track data to quantify any correlation between these mergers and neutrino events. First, we perform the single source search analysis, which reveals that none of the considered galaxy mergers exhibit a statistically significant correlation with high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Furthermore, we conduct a stacking analysis with three different weighting schemes to understand if these galaxy mergers can contribute significantly to the diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. We find that upper limits (at $95\%$ CL) of the all flavor high-energy neutrino flux, associated with galaxy mergers considered in this study, at $100$ TeV with spectral index $\Gamma=-2$ are $1.11\times 10^{-18}$, $3.69 \times 10^{-19}$ and $1.02 \times 10^{-18}$ $\rm GeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$ for the three weighting schemes. This work shows that these selected galaxy mergers do not contribute significantly to the IceCube detected high energy neutrino flux. We hope that in the near future with more data, the search for neutrinos from galaxy mergers can either discover their neutrino production or impose more stringent constraints on the production mechanism of high-energy neutrinos within galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>High-energy Neutrino Source Cross-correlations with Nearest-neighbor Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origins of the majority of the IceCube neutrinos remain unknown. Effectively characterizing the spatial distribution of the neutrino samples and associating the events with astrophysical source catalogs can be challenging given the large atmospheric neutrino background and underlying non-Gaussian spatial features in the neutrino and source samples. In this paper, we investigate a framework for identifying and statistically evaluating the cross-correlations between IceCube data and an astrophysical source catalog based on the $k$-nearest-neighbor cumulative distribution functions ($k$NN-CDFs). We propose a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for inferring the true proportions of astrophysical neutrinos in the point-source data. We conduct a statistical power analysis of an associated likelihood ratio test with estimations of its sensitivity and discovery potential with synthetic neutrino data samples and a WISE-2MASS galaxy sample. We apply the method to IceCube's public ten-year point-source data and find no statistically significant evidence for spatial cross-correlations with the selected galaxy sample. We discuss possible extensions to the current method and explore the method's potential to identify the cross-correlation signals in data sets with different sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Friedmann cosmology with hyperfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In metric-affine gravity, both the gravitational and matter actions depend not just on the metric, but also on the independent affine connection. Thus matter can be modeled as a hyperfluid, characterized by both the energy-momentum and hypermomentum tensors. The latter is defined as the variation of the matter action with respect to the connection and it encodes extra (micro)properties of particles. For a homogeneous and isotropic universe, it was recently shown that the generic cosmological hypermomentum possesses five degrees of freedom: one in dilation, two in shear, and two in spin part. The aim of the current work is to present the first systematic study of the implications of this perfect hyperfluid on the universe with Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. We adopt a simple model with non-Riemannian Einstein-Hilbert gravitational action plus arbitrary hyperfluid matter, and solve analytically the cosmological equations for single and multiple component hypermomentum contributions using different assumptions about the equation of state. It is remarkable, that in a number of cases the forms of the time evolution of the Hubble function and energy density still coincide with their general relativity counterparts, only the respective indexes $\mathrm{w}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\mathrm{w}_\rho$ start to differ due to the hypermomentum corrections. The results and insights we obtained are very general and can assist in constructing interesting models to resolve the issues in standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Probing a diffuse flux of axion-like particles from galactic supernovae with neutrino water Cherenkov detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we claim that axion-like particles (ALPs) with MeV masses can be produced with semi-relativistic velocities in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), generating a diffuse galactic flux. We show that these ALPs can be detected in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors via $a \, p \rightarrow p \, \gamma$ interactions. Using Super-Kamiokande data, we derive new constraints on the ALP parameter space, excluding a region spanning more than one order of magnitude in the ALP-proton coupling above cooling bounds for ALP masses in the range of $1-80$ MeV and ALP-proton couplings between $8\times10^{-6}-2\times10^{-4}$. We show that the future Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to probe couplings as small as $2.5\times10^{-6}$, fully closing the allowed region above SN 1987A cooling bounds.</description>

      <title>Double Exponents in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Axion-wind near Earth's Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several detection strategies for wave-like dark matter make use of gradients in the dark matter field, e.g. searches for spin-dependent derivative interactions in CASPEr-wind or experiments looking for oscillating forces. These gradients are usually suppressed by the local dark matter velocity $\sim 10^{-3}$. In this note we investigate how these gradients are modified in the presence of additional quadratic interactions of the dark matter field with ordinary matter. In this case the dark matter density and field are modified in the vicinity of Earth, affecting the detection sensitivity due to the change in the local field value at the Earth's surface but also due to the gradient of the field profile itself. We also use this opportunity to present results on the expected field profiles in presence of a non-vanishing relative velocity of the dark matter with respect to Earth. We also comment how this ameliorates the divergences that appear for certain attractive coupling values.</description>
