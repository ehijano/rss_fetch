      <title>Advanced Applications of Generative AI in Actuarial Science: Case Studies Beyond ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article demonstrates the transformative impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on actuarial science, illustrated by four implemented case studies. It begins with a historical overview of AI, tracing its evolution from early neural networks to modern GenAI technologies. The first case study shows how Large Language Models (LLMs) improve claims cost prediction by deriving significant features from unstructured textual data, significantly reducing prediction errors in the underlying machine learning task. In the second case study, we explore the automation of market comparisons using the GenAI concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to identify and process relevant information from documents. A third case study highlights the capabilities of fine-tuned vision-enabled LLMs in classifying car damage types and extracting contextual information. The fourth case study presents a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes data from a given dataset and generates a corresponding report detailing the key findings. In addition to these case studies, we outline further potential applications of GenAI in the insurance industry, such as the automation of claims processing and fraud detection, and the verification of document compliance with internal or external policies. Finally, we discuss challenges and considerations associated with the use of GenAI, covering regulatory issues, ethical concerns, and technical limitations, among others.</description>

      <title>Benchmark-Neutral Risk-Minimization for insurance products and nonreplicable claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the pricing and hedging of nonreplicable contingent claims, such as long-term insurance contracts like variable annuities. Our approach is based on the benchmark-neutral pricing framework of Platen (2024), which differs from the classical benchmark approach by using the stock growth optimal portfolio as the num\'eraire. In typical settings, this choice leads to an equivalent martingale measure, the benchmark-neutral measure. The resulting prices can be significantly lower than the respective risk-neutral ones, making this approach attractive for long-term risk-management.
  We derive the associated risk-minimizing hedging strategy under the assumption that the contingent claim possesses a martingale decomposition. For a set of nonreplicable contingent claims, these strategies allow monitoring the working capital required to generate their payoffs and enable an assessment of the resulting diversification effects. Furthermore, an algorithmic refinancing strategy is proposed that allows modeling the working capital. Finally, insurance-finance arbitrages of the first kind are introduced and it is demonstrated that benchmark-neutral pricing effectively avoids such arbitrages.</description>
