      <title>Untriangular factorization of holomorpic symplectic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every holomorphic symplectic matrix can be factorized as a product of holomorphic unitriangular matrices with respect to the symplectic form $ \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 0 &amp; L_n \\ -L_n &amp; 0\end{array}\right]$ where $L$ is the $n \times n$ matrix with $1$ along the skew-diagonal. Also we prove that holomorphic unitriangular matrices with respect to this symplectic form are products of not more than $7$ holomorphic unitriangular matrices with respect to the standard symplectic form $\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 0 &amp; I_n \\ -I_n &amp; 0\end{array}\right]$, thus solving an open problem posed in \cite{HKS}. Combining these two results allows for estimates of the optimal number of factors in the factorization by holomorphic unitriangular matrices with respect to the standard symplectic form. The existence of that factorization was obtained earlier by Ivarsson-Kutzschebauch and Schott, however without any estimates. Another byproduct of our results is a new, much less technical and more elegant proof of this factorization.</description>

      <title>On harmonic quasiregular mappings in Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Hardy and Littlewood says that if $f=u+iv$ is analytic in the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ and $u$ is in the harmonic Bergman space $a^p$ ($0&lt;p&lt;\infty$), then $v$ is also in $a^p$. This complements a celebrated result of M. Riesz on Hardy spaces, which only holds for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. These results do not extend directly to complex-valued harmonic functions. We prove that the Hardy-Littlewood theorem holds for a harmonic function $f=u+iv$ if we place the assumption that $f$ is quasiregular in $\mathbb{D}$. This makes further progress on the recent Riesz type theorems for harmonic quasiregular mappings by several authors.
  Then we consider univalent harmonic mappings in $\mathbb{D}$ and study their membership in Bergman spaces. In particular, we produce a non-trivial range of $p&gt;0$ such that every univalent harmonic function $f$ (and the partial derivatives $f_\theta,\, rf_r$) is of class $a^p$. This result extends nicely to harmonic quasiconformal mappings in $\mathbb{D}$.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-Sobolev Theory for $\bar\partial$ on Domains in $\Bbb {CP}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19355v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the range of the Cauchy-Riemann operator $\bar\partial$ on domains in the complex projective space $\Bbb{CP}^n$. In particular, we show that $\bar\partial$ does not have closed range in $L^2$ for (2,1)-forms on the Hartogs triangle in $\Bbb{CP}^2$. We also study the $\bar\partial$-Cauchy problem on pseudoconvex domains and use it to prove the Sobolev estimates for $\bar\partial$ on pseudoconcave domains in $\Bbb{CP}^n$.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Discrete Models of Maximum Likelihood Degree One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We settle a conjecture by Bik and Marigliano stating that the degree of a one-dimensional discrete model with rational maximum likelihood estimator is bounded above by a linear function in the size of its support, therefore showing that there are only finitely many fundamental such models for any given number of states. We study these models from a combinatorial perspective with regard to their existence and enumeration. In particular, sharp models, those whose degree attains the maximal bound, enjoy special properties and have been studied as monomial maps between unit spheres. In this way, we present a novel link between Cauchy-Riemann geometry and algebraic statistics.</description>

      <title>Constructive Proof of the Hodge Conjecture for K3 Surfaces via Nodal Degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a constructive proof of the Hodge conjecture for complex $K3$ surfaces that does not rely on Torelli-type results. Starting with an arbitrary rational $(1,1)$-class $\alpha\in H^{1,1}(X,\mathbb{Q})$, we algorithmically build a one-parameter family of quartic $K3$'s acquiring at most ten $A_1$-nodes. On the central fibre $\widetilde{X}_0$, the class $\alpha$ specializes to a $\mathbb{Q}$-linear combination of the hyperplane class and the exceptional $(-2)$-curves coming from the blow-ups of the nodes. Using the Clemens--Schmid sequence together with Picard--Lefschetz theory, we identify $\Gr^W_2 H^2_{\lim}\cong H^2(\widetilde{X}_0)$ and transport this combination back to the original smooth surface as an algebraic divisor. This yields an explicit, finite-step procedure that realizes any rational $(1,1)$-class by an algebraic cycle. We also formulate an equivariant extension for $(2,2)$-classes on Calabi--Yau threefolds, indicating how the same strategy might apply in higher dimension.</description>

      <title>$L^2$ Fr\"olicher inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Fr\"olicher inequality between $L^2$ Betti and $L^2$ Hodge numbers on normal coverings of compact complex manifolds. This is achieved by building an injection using suitable spectral projectors associated to the self adjoint operators $(D_h)^2:=(\overline\partial+\overline\partial^*+h\partial+h\partial^*)^2$ for $h\in[0,1]$. As a by-product, we find a new proof of the classical Fr\"olicher inequality on compact complex manifolds which does not rely at all on spectral sequences.</description>

      <title>Errett Bishop theorems on Complex Analytic Sets: Chow's Theorem Revisited and Foliations with all leaves Compact on K\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a series of seemingly unrelated results of Complex Analysis which are in fact connected via a different approach to their proofs using the results of Errett Bishop of volumes and limits of analytic varieties. We start by proving Chow's theorem by a technique suggested long time ago in the beautiful book by Gabriel Stolzenberg. We think this approach is very attractive and easier for students and newcomers to understand; also the theory presented here is linked to areas of mathematics that are not usually associated with Chow's result. In addition, Bishop's results imply both Chow's and Remmert-Stein's theorems directly, meaning that this view is simpler and just as profound as Remmert-Stein's proof. After that, we give a comparison table that explains how Bishop's theorems generalize to several complex variables classical results of one complex variable and prove Montel's compactness theorem using the techniques presented here. Finally we give an alternative proof of a theorem of Edwards, Millet and Sullivan of foliations with compact leaves for the case of complex foliations in K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic null curves in the special linear group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the theory of approximation for holomorphic null curves in the special linear group ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. In particular, we establish Runge, Mergelyan, Mittag-Leffler, and Carleman type theorems for the family of holomorphic null immersions $M\to{\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ from any open Riemann surface $M$. Our results include jet interpolation of Weierstrass type and approximation by embeddings, as well as global conditions on the approximating curves. As application, we show that every open Riemann surface admits a proper holomorphic null embedding into ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$, and hence also a proper conformal immersion of constant mean curvature $1$ into hyperbolic 3-space. This settles a problem posed by Alarcon and Forstneric in 2015.</description>
