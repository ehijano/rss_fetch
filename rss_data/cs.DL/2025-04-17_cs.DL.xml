      <title>TRIDIS: A Comprehensive Medieval and Early Modern Corpus for HTR and NER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces TRIDIS (Tria Digita Scribunt), an open-source corpus of medieval and early modern manuscripts. TRIDIS aggregates multiple legacy collections (all published under open licenses) and incorporates large metadata descriptions. While prior publications referenced some portions of this corpus, here we provide a unified overview with a stronger focus on its constitution. We describe (i) the narrative, chronological, and editorial background of each major sub-corpus, (ii) its semi-diplomatic transcription rules (expansion, normalization, punctuation), (iii) a strategy for challenging out-of-domain test splits driven by outlier detection in a joint embedding space, and (iv) preliminary baseline experiments using TrOCR and MiniCPM2.5 comparing random and outlier-based test partitions. Overall, TRIDIS is designed to stimulate joint robust Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) research across medieval and early modern textual heritage.</description>

      <title>OntoPortal-Astro, a Semantic Artefact Catalogue for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astronomy communities are widely recognised as mature communities for their open science practices. However, while their data ecosystems are rather advanced and permit efficient data interoperability, there are still gaps between these ecosystems. Semantic artefacts (e.g., ontologies, thesauri, vocabularies or metadata schemas) are a means to bridge that gap as they allow to semantically described the data and map the underlying concepts. The increasing use of semantic artefacts in astronomy presents challenges in description, selection, evaluation, trust, and mappings. The landscape remains fragmented, with semantic artefacts scattered across various registries in diverse formats and structures -- not yet fully developed or encoded with rich semantic web standards like OWL or SKOS -- and often with overlapping scopes. Enhancing data semantic interoperability requires common platforms to catalog, align, and facilitate the sharing of FAIR semantic artefacts. In the frame of the FAIR-IMPACT project, we prototyped a semantic artefact catalogue for astronomy, heliophysics and planetary sciences. This exercise resulted in improved vocabulary and ontology management in the communities, and is now paving the way for better interdisciplinary data discovery and reuse. This article presents current practices in our discipline, reviews candidate SAs for such a catalogue, presents driving use cases and the perspective of a real production service for the astronomy community based on the OntoPortal technology, that will be called OntoPortal-Astro.</description>
