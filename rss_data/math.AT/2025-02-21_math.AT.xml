      <title>On the Birman exact sequence of the subgroups of the mapping class group of genus three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any finite index subgroup of the mapping class group containing the Johnson subgroup, the profinite Birman exact sequence does not split in genus $g\ge 3$, extending prior results of Hain and the second author for $g\ge 4$. For the Torelli group, we prove that the graded Lie algebra version of the Birman exact sequence admits no section with symplectic equivariance, extending Hain's result from $g\ge 4$ to $g=3$. These results are deduced by our main tool, relative completion, with the help of Hodge theory and representation theory of symplectic groups, along with explicit structural obstructions coming from hyperelliptic mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Causality Analysis of COVID-19 Induced Crashes in Stock and Commodity Markets: A Topological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a comprehensive causality analysis of the US stock and commodity markets during the COVID-19 crash. The dynamics of different sectors are also compared. We use Topological Data Analysis (TDA) on multidimensional time-series to identify crashes in stock and commodity markets. The Wasserstein Distance WD shows distinct spikes signaling the crash for both stock and commodity markets. We then compare the persistence diagrams of stock and commodity markets using the WD metric. A significant spike in the $WD$ between stock and commodity markets is observed during the crisis, suggesting significant topological differences between the markets. Similar spikes are observed between the sectors of the US market as well. Spikes obtained may be due to either a difference in the magnitude of crashes in the two markets (or sectors), or from the temporal lag between the two markets suggesting information flow. We study the Granger-causality between stock and commodity markets and also between different sectors. The results show a bidirectional Granger-causality between commodity and stock during the crash period, demonstrating the greater interdependence of financial markets during the crash. However, the overall analysis shows that the causal direction is from stock to commodity. A pairwise Granger-causal analysis between US sectors is also conducted. There is a significant increase in the interdependence between the sectors during the crash period. TDA combined with Granger-causality effectively analyzes the interdependence and sensitivity of different markets and sectors.</description>

      <title>Relation between intersection homology and homotopy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Goresky and MacPherson intersection homology is not the homology of a space, there is no preferred candidate for intersection homotopy groups. Here, they are defined as the homotopy groups of a simplicial set which P. Gajer associates to a couple $(X,\overline{p})$ of a filtered space and a perversity. We first establish some basic properties for the intersection fundamental groups, as a Van Kampen theorem.
  For general intersection homotopy groups on Siebenmann CS sets, we prove a Hurewicz theorem between them and the Goresky and MacPherson intersection homology. If the CS set and its intrinsic stratification have the same regular part, we establish the topological invariance of the $\overline{p}$-intersection homotopy groups. Several examples justify the hypotheses made in the statements. Finally, intersection homotopy groups also coincide with the homotopy groups of the topological space itself, for the top perversity on a connected, normal Thom-Mather space.</description>

      <title>Parametrized homotopic distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of parametrized homotopic distance, extending the classical notion of homotopic distance to the fibrewise setting. We establish its correspondence with the fibrewise sectional category of a specific fibrewise fibration and derive cohomological lower bounds and connectivity upper bounds under mild conditions. We also analyze the behavior of parametrized homotopic distance under compositions and products of fibrewise maps, along with its interaction with the triangle inequality.
  We establish several sufficient conditions for fibrewise $H$-spaces to admit a fibrewise division map and prove that their parametrized topological complexity equals their fibrewise unpointed Lusternik-Schnirelman category, extending Lupton and Scherer's theorem to the fibrewise setting. Additionally, we give sharp estimates for the parametrized topological complexity of a class fibrewise $H$-spaces which arises as sphere bundles with fibre $S^7$. Furthermore, we estimate the parametrized homotopic distance of fibre-preserving, fibrewise maps between fibrewise fibrations, in terms of the parametrized homotopic distance of the induced fibrewise maps between individual fibres, as well as the fibrewise unpointed Lusternik-Schnirelman category of the base space.
  Finally, we define and study a pointed version of parametrized homotopic distance, establishing cohomological bounds and identifying key conditions for its equivalence with the unpointed version, thus providing a finer classification of fibrewise homotopy invariants.</description>

      <title>Letter-braiding: bridging combinatorial group theory and topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define invariants of words in arbitrary groups, measuring how letters in a word are interleaving, perfectly detecting the dimension series of a group. These are the letter-braiding invariants. On free groups, braiding invariants coincide with coefficients in the Magnus expansion. In contrast with Magnus' coefficients, our invariants are defined on all groups and over any PID. They respect products in the group and are a complete invariant of the dimension series, so they are the coefficients of a universal multiplicative finite-type invariant, depending functorially on the group.
  Letter-braiding invariants arise from the bar construction on a cochain model of a space with a prescribed fundamental group. This approach specializes to simplicial presentations of a group as well as to more geometric contexts, which we illustrate in examples. As an application, we define variants of the Johnson filtration and the Johnson homomorphism on the automorphisms of arbitrary groups, and use them to constrain automorphisms of finite p-groups.</description>

      <title>Top-degree rational cohomology in the symplectic group of a number ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $R = \mathcal{O}_K$. We show that if $R$ is not a principal ideal domain, then the symplectic group $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(R)$ has non-trivial rational cohomology in its virtual cohomological dimension. This demonstrates a sharp contrast to the situation where $R$ is Euclidean. To prove our result, we study the symplectic Steinberg module, i.e. the top-dimensional homology group of the spherical building associated to $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(K)$. We show that this module is not generated by integral apartment classes.</description>

      <title>$O(k)$-Equivariant Dimensionality Reduction on Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world datasets live on high-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds, $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and $Gr(k, \mathbb{R}^N)$ respectively, and benefit from projection onto lower-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds. In this work, we propose an algorithm called \textit{Principal Stiefel Coordinates (PSC)} to reduce data dimensionality from $ V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ to $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in an \textit{$O(k)$-equivariant} manner ($k \leq n \ll N$). We begin by observing that each element $\alpha \in V_n(\mathbb{R}^N)$ defines an isometric embedding of $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ into $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Next, we describe two ways of finding a suitable embedding map $\alpha$: one via an extension of principal component analysis ($\alpha_{PCA}$), and one that further minimizes data fit error using gradient descent ($\alpha_{GD}$). Then, we define a continuous and $O(k)$-equivariant map $\pi_\alpha$ that acts as a "closest point operator" to project the data onto the image of $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ under the embedding determined by $\alpha$, while minimizing distortion. Because this dimensionality reduction is $O(k)$-equivariant, these results extend to Grassmannian manifolds as well. Lastly, we show that $\pi_{\alpha_{PCA}}$ globally minimizes projection error in a noiseless setting, while $\pi_{\alpha_{GD}}$ achieves a meaningfully different and improved outcome when the data does not lie exactly on the image of a linearly embedded lower-dimensional Stiefel manifold as above. Multiple numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world data are performed.</description>
