      <title>The Turing Pattern Transition with the Growing Domain and Metabolic Rate Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the phenomenon of pattern transitions on the body surfaces of mammals during their transition from juveniles to adults and with seasonal changes. Our previous research suggests that patterns formed during infancy may disperse due to the growing domain (GD) effects, but their transition is sensitive to parameter values. Thus, in the present study, we focus on a factor that can change due to domain growth, such as heat. Generally, the greater the ratio of surface area to volume, the more easily heat within it is dissipated. Hence, it can be considered that smaller organisms may lose heat more easily while larger organisms may retain it more effectively. In fact, thermoregulation during infancy is a crucial factor directly influencing survival. We propose a theoretical model, incorporating GD and Metabolic-Rate (MR) effects, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms robustly driving these pattern transitions. The model suggests that Turing patterns formed during juvenile stages disperse in adulthood, due to domain growth and changes in metabolic rates affecting reaction rates. Numerical analysis results demonstrate that when both the GD and the MR effects are incorporated, patterns disperse more rapidly compared to the case where only the GD effects are considered. Additionally, we discuss the potential correlations among pattern transitions, growth, and thermoregulation mechanisms, highlighting the importance of metabolic rates in maintaining temperature within the domain. Our findings provide insights into the complex interplay between growth, thermoregulation, and pattern transitions in mammals, possibly useful for further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Biophysics in Africa: challenges, priorities, and hopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report is a serious call to scientists, innovators, investors, and policymakers to invest in the development of biophysics in Africa. The complex problems of our day demand multidisciplinary approaches, and biophysics offers training in much-needed multi- and cross-disciplinary thinking. Biophysics is a research field at the forefront of modern science because it provides a powerful scientific platform that addresses many of the critical challenges humanity faces today and in the future. It is a vital source of innovation for any country interested in developing a high-tech economy. However, there is woefully little biophysics educational and research activity in Africa, representing a critical gap that must be addressed with urgency. This report suggests key research areas that African biophysicists should focus on, identifies major challenges to growing biophysics in Africa, and underscores the high-priority needs that must be addressed.</description>

      <title>Non Equilibrium Transitions in a Polymer Replication Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fuel-driven process of replication in living systems generates distributions of copied entities with varying degrees of copying accuracy. Here we introduce a thermodynamically consistent ensemble for investigating universal population features of replicating systems. In the context of copolymer copying, coarse-graining over molecular details, we establish a phase diagram of copying accuracy. We discover sharp non-equilibrium transitions between populations of random and accurate copies. Maintaining a population of accurate copies requires a minimum energy expenditure that depends on the configurational entropy of copolymer sequences.</description>

      <title>A molecular dynamics simulation of the abrupt changes in the thermodynamic properties of water after formation of nano-bubbles / nano-cavities induced by passage of charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale formalism that accounts for the formation of nano-scale bubbles/cavities owing to a burst of water molecules after the passage of high energy charged particles that leads to the formation of hot non-ionizing excitations or thermal spikes (TS). We demonstrate the coexistence of a rapidly growing condensed state of water and a hot spot that forms a stable state of diluted water at high temperatures and pressures, possibly at a supercritical phase. Depending on the temperature of TS, the thin shell of a highly dense state of water grows by three to five times the speed of sound in water, forming a thin layer of shock wave (SW) buffer, wrapping around the nano-scale cylindrical symmetric cavity. The stability of the cavity, as a result of the incompressibility of water at ambient conditions and the surface tension, allows the transition of supersonic SW to a subsonic contact discontinuity and dissipation to thermo-acoustic sound waves. We further study the mergers of nanobubbles that lead to fountain-like or jet-flow structures at the collision interface. We introduce a time delay in the nucleation of nano-bubbles, a novel mechanism, responsible for the growth and stability of much larger or even micro-bubbles, possibly relevant to FLASH ultra-high dose rate (UHDR). The current study is potentially significant at FLASH-UHDRs. Our analysis predicts the black-body radiation from the transient supercritical state of water localized in nano-cavities wrapping around the track of charged particles can be manifested in the (indirect) water luminescence spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the Echogenicity of Natural Starch-Based Blood Mimicking Fluids for Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging: Preliminary In-vitro Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural starch-based blood-mimicking fluid (BMF) has been used as an alternative to commercially available BMFs for in-vitro Doppler investigations in low-resource settings. Most reported works in the literature have used corn starch-based BMF. Evaluation of other natural starches for potential BMF and their characterization have relatively been unexplored in the literature. To this end, this work investigates the echogenicity of corn-, potato-, tapioca-, and wheat starch-based BMFs prepared using a liquid base of pure water-glycerol mixture with three different starch concentrations (1%, 3%, and 5%). The experiments were performed by manually pumping the BMFs to a PolyVinyl alcohol (PVA) based flow phantom using a syringe and raw datasets were acquired using a Verasonics Vantage 128 Research Ultrasound System. Echogenicity was measured as the mean pixel intensity in a selected region of interest (ROI) in the beamformed image. Among the four natural starch-based BMFs, potato starch-based BMF showed the highest echogenicity and contrast with almost 13%, 14%, and 10% higher pixel intensities (dB) than that of the least echoic BMF with 1%, 3%, and 5% starch concentrations respectively. Moreover, the echogenicity of corn, tapioca, and wheat starch-based BMF was observed to be similar, and the results suggest that these BMFs with higher starch concentrations shall be employed for in-vitro contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pairwise: Higher-order physical interactions affect phase separation in multi-component liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation, crucial for spatially segregating biomolecules in cells, is well-understood in the simple case of a few components with pairwise interactions. Yet, biological cells challenge the simple picture in at least two ways: First, biomolecules, like proteins and nucleic acids, exhibit complex, higher-order interactions, where a single molecule may interact with multiple others simultaneously. Second, cells comprise a myriad of different components that form various droplets. Such multicomponent phase separation has been studied in the simple case of pairwise interactions, but an analysis of higher-order interactions is lacking. We propose such a theory and study the corresponding phase diagrams numerically. We find that interactions between three components are similar to pairwise interactions, whereas composition-dependent higher-order interactions between two components can oppose phase separation. This surprising result can only be revealed from the equilibrium phase diagrams, implying that the often-used stability analysis of homogeneous states is inadequate to study these systems. We thus show that higher-order interactions could play a crucial role in forming droplets in cells, and their manipulation could offer novel approaches to controlling multicomponent phase separation.</description>

      <title>A perspective on active glassy dynamics in biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics is central to living systems. In the last two decades, experiments have revealed that the dynamics in diverse biological systems - from intracellular cytoplasm to cellular and organismal aggregates - are remarkably similar to that in dense systems of inanimate particles in equilibrium. They show a glass transition from a solid-like jammed state to a fluid-like flowing state, where a moderate change in control parameter leads to an enormous variation in relaxation time. However, biological systems have crucial differences from the equilibrium systems: the former have activity that drives them out of equilibrium, novel control parameters, and enormous levels of complexity. These active systems showing glassy dynamics are known as active glasses. The field is at the interface of physics and biology, freely borrowing tools from both disciplines and promising novel, fascinating discoveries. We review the experiments that started this field, simulations that have been instrumental for insights, and theories that have helped unify diverse phenomena, reveal correlations, and make novel quantitative predictions. We discuss the primary characteristics that define a glassy system. For most concepts, we first discuss the known equilibrium scenario and then present the key aspects when activity is introduced. We end the article with a discussion of the challenges in the field and possible future directions.</description>

      <title>Ising model with non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective interactions that violate Newton's third law of action-reaction symmetry are common in systems where interactions are mediated by a non-equilibrium environment. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried out on a two-dimensional Ising model, where the interactions are modified non-reciprocally. We demonstrate that the critical temperature decreases as the non-reciprocity increases and this decrease depends only on the magnitude of non-reciprocity. Further, travelling spin waves due to the local fluctuations in magnetisation are observed and these spin waves travel opposite to the non-reciprocity vector.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometric Rays: A simple method to compute the controllable set of enzymatic reaction systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple method to compute the controllable set of chemical reaction systems with enzyme concentrations as the control parameters is presented. The method features the fact that the catalyst enhances the reaction rate while not changing the equilibrium, and it enables the efficient computation of the global controllability of linear- and nonlinear models. The method is applied to the reversible Brusselator and the toy model of cellular metabolism. With the metabolism model, we show that the stoichiometric rays is a powerful tool for quantifying the ``life-death boundary" of the cell model.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in the computational complexity of the shortest common superstring and genome assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome assembly, the process of reconstructing a long genetic sequence by aligning and merging short fragments, or reads, is known to be NP-hard, either as a version of the shortest common superstring problem or in a Hamiltonian-cycle formulation. That is, the computing time is believed to grow exponentially with the the problem size in the worst case. Despite this fact, high-throughput technologies and modern algorithms currently allow bioinformaticians to handle datasets of billions of reads. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we address this conundrum by demonstrating the existence of a phase transition in the computational complexity of the problem and showing that practical instances always fall in the 'easy' phase (solvable by polynomial-time algorithms). In addition, we propose a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method that outperforms common deterministic algorithms in the hard regime.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Voronoi Tessellations as Models for Cellular Neighborhoods in Simple Multicellular Organisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on distinct multicellular organisms has revealed a hitherto unknown type of biological noise; rather than a regular arrangement, cellular neighborhood volumes, obtained by Voronoi tessellations of the cell locations, are broadly distributed and consistent with gamma distributions. We propose an explanation for those observations in the case of the alga $Volvox$, whose somatic cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM) they export. Both a solvable one-dimensional model of ECM growth derived from bursty transcriptional activity and a two-dimensional "Voronoi liquid" model are shown to provide one-parameter families that smoothly interpolate between the empirically-observed near-maximum-entropy gamma distributions and the crystalline limit of Gaussian distributions governed by the central limit theorem. These results highlight a universal consequence of intrinsic biological noise on the architecture of certain tissues.</description>
