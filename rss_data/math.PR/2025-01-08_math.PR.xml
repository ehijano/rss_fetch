      <title>Markov branching process with infinite variance and non-homogeneous immigration with infinite mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies a class of critical Markov branching processes with infinite variance of the offspring distribution. The processes admit also an immigration component at the jump-points of a non-homogeneous Poisson process, assuming that the mean number of immigrants is infinite and the intensity of the Poisson process converges to zero. The asymptotic behavior of the probability for non-visiting zero is obtained. Limiting distributions are proved, under suitable normalization of the sample paths, depending on the offspring distribution, on the distribution of the immigrants and on the intensity of the Poisson process.</description>

      <title>Aspects of a randomly growing cluster in $\reals^d,d\geq 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a simple model of a growing cluster of points in $\Re^d,d\geq 2$. Beginning with a point $X_1$ located at the origin, we generate a random sequence of points $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_i,\ldots,$. To generate $X_{i},i\geq 2$ we choose a uniform integer $j$ in $[i-1]=\{1,2,\ldots,i-1\}$ and then let $X_{i}=X_j+D_i$ where $D_i=(\delta_1,\ldots,\delta_d)$. Here the $\delta_j$ are independent copies of the Normal distribution $N(0,\sigma_i)$, where $\sigma_i=i^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$. We prove that for any $\alpha&gt;0$ the resulting point set is bounded a.s., and moreover, that the points generated look like samples from a $\beta$-dimensional subset of $\Re^d$ from the standpoint of the minimum lengths of combinatorial structures on the point-sets, where $\beta=\min(d,1/\alpha)$.</description>

      <title>Rabbit Hunting using Set Theory and Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine an invisible rabbit that starts at some unknown integer point $A$ on the number line. At each time step, it hops by a fixed but unknown integer stride $B$. Both $A$ and $B$ are fixed integers, but their values are unknown. Suppose you have a magic hammer that you can throw at any integer point on the number line at each time step. When the hammer strikes the rabbit, it instantly squeals, indicating you have hit it. The problem now is to devise a strategy that guarantees your hammer will hit the rabbit in finitely many steps. We will provide two algorithms to solve this problem. The first involves Cantor's diagonal trick from set theory, and the second is a probabilistic approach.</description>

      <title>Sharp two-weight inequality for fractional maximal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to two-weight estimates for the fractional maximal operators $\mathcal{M}^\alpha$ on general probability spaces equipped with a tree-like structure. For given $1&lt;p\leq q&lt;\infty$, we study the sharp universal upper bound for the norm $ \|\mathcal{M}^\alpha\|_{L^p(v)\to L^q(u)}$, where $(u,v)$ is an arbitrary pair of weights satisfying the Sawyer testing condition. The proof is based on the abstract Bellman function method, which reveals an unexpected connection of the above problem with the sharp version of the classical Sobolev imbedding theorem.</description>

      <title>Analyticity of the pressure function for products of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressure function is a fundamental object in various areas of mathematics. Its regularity is studied to derive insights into phase transitions in certain physical systems or to determine the Hausdorff dimension of self-affine sets. In this paper, we prove the analyticity of the pressure function for products of non-invertible matrices satisfying an irreducibility and a contractivity assumptions. Additionally, we establish a variational principle for the pressure function, thereby generalizing previous results.</description>

      <title>Pullback measure attractors for non-autonomous stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo system with distribution dependence on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is primarily focused on the asymptotic dynamics of a non-autonomous stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo system with distribution dependence, specifically on unbounded domains $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Initially, we establish the well-posedness of solutions for the FitzHugh-Nagumo system with distribution dependence by utilizing the Banach fixed-point theorem. Subsequently, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of pullback measure attractors for this system through the application of splitting techniques, tail-end estimates and Vitali's theorem.</description>

      <title>On the spectral radius and the characteristic polynomial of a random matrix with independent elements and a variance profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that with large probability, the spectral radius of a large non-Hermitian random matrix with a general variance profile does not exceed the square root of the spectral radius of the variance profile matrix. A minimal moment assumption is considered and sparse variance profiles are covered. Following an approach developed recently by Bordenave, Chafa{\"i} and Garc{\'i}a-Zelada, the key theorem states the asymptotic equivalence between the reverse characteristic polynomial of the random matrix at hand and a random analytic function which depends on the variance profile matrix. The result is applied to the case of a non-Hermitian random matrix with a variance profile given by a piecewise constant or a continuous non-negative function, the inhomogeneous (centered) directed Erd\H{o}s-R{\'e}nyi model, and more.</description>

      <title>An explicit link between graphical models and Gaussian Markov random fields on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an explicit link between Gaussian Markov random fields on metric graphs and graphical models, and in particular show that a Markov random field restricted to the vertices of the graph is, under mild regularity conditions, a Gaussian graphical model with a distribution which is faithful to its pairwise independence graph, which coincides with the neighbor structure of the metric graph. This is used to show that there are no Gaussian random fields on general metric graphs which are both Markov and isotropic in some suitably regular metric on the graph, such as the geodesic or resistance metrics.</description>

Abstract: We analyze Gaussian analytic functions (GAFs) defined as power series with coefficients modeled by discrete stationary Gaussian processes, utilizing their spectral measures. We revisit some limit theorems for random analytic functions and examine some examples of GAFs through numerical computations. Furthermore, we provide an integral representation of the n-point correlation functions of the zero sets of GAFs in terms of the spectral measures of the underlying coefficient Gaussian processes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic volatility model with long memory for water quantity-quality dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water quantity and quality are vital indices for assessing fluvial environments. These indices are highly variable over time and include sub-exponential memory, where the influences of past events persist over long durations. Moreover, water quantity and quality are interdependent, with the former affecting the latter. However, this relationship has not been thoroughly studied from the perspective of long-memory processes, which this paper aims to address. We propose applying a new stochastic volatility model, a system of infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, to describe dynamic asset prices in finance and economics. Although the stochastic volatility model was originally developed for phenomena unrelated to the water environment, its mathematical universality allows for an interdisciplinary reinterpretation: river discharge is analogous to volatility, and water quality to asset prices. Moreover, the model's infinite-dimensional nature enables the analytical description of sub-exponential memory. The moments and autocorrelations of the model are then obtained analytically. We mathematically analyze the stochastic volatility model and investigate its applicability to the dynamics of water quantity and quality. Finally, we apply the model to real time-series data from a river in Japan, demonstrating that it effectively captures both the memory and the correlation of water quality indices to river discharge. This approach, grounded in infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, represents a novel contribution to the modelling and analysis of environmental systems where long memory processes play a role.</description>

      <title>Several facts about Theodor Wittstein, Gaetano Balducci, and some expressions of the net single premiums under their mortality assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical essence in life insurance spins around the search of the nu\-me\-ri\-cal characteristics of the random variables $T_x$, $\nu^{T_x}$, $T_x\nu^{T_x}$, etc., where $\nu$ (deterministic) denotes the discount multiplier and $T_x$ (random) is the future lifetime of an in\-di\-vi\-dual being of $x\in\{0,\,1,\,\ldots\}$ years old. This work provides some historical facts about T. Wittstein and G. Balducci and their mortality assumption. We also develop some formulas that make it easier to compute the moments of the mentioned random variables assuming that the survival function is interpolated according to Balducci's assumption. Derived formulas are verified using some hypothetical mortality data.</description>

      <title>Dormancy in random environment: Symmetric exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a spatial model for dormancy in random environment via a two-type branching random walk in continuous-time, where individuals can switch between dormant and active states through spontaneous switching independent of the random environment. However, the branching mechanism is governed by a random environment which dictates the branching rates, namely the simple symmetric exclusion process. We will interpret the presence of the exclusion particles either as catalysts, accelerating the branching mechanism, or as traps, aiming to kill the individuals. The difference between active and dormant individuals is defined in such a way that dormant individuals are protected from being trapped, but do not participate in migration or branching. We quantify the influence of dormancy on the growth resp. survival of the population by identifying the large-time asymptotics of the expected population size. The starting point for our mathematical considerations and proofs is the parabolic Anderson model via the Feynman-Kac formula. In particular, the quantitative investigation of the role of dormancy is done by extending the Parabolic Anderson model to a two-type random walk.</description>

      <title>Temporal regularity for the stochastic heat equation with rough dependence in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the nonlinear stochastic heat equation $$
  \frac{\partial u (t,x)}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial^2 u (t,x)}{\partial x^2}+ \sigma(u (t,x))\dot{W}(t,x),\quad t&gt; 0,\,
  x\in \mathbb{R}, $$ where $\dot W$ is a Gaussian noise which is white in time and has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(\frac 14,\frac 12)$ in the space variable. When $\sigma(0)=0$, the well-posedness of the solution and its H\"older continuity have been proved by Hu et al. \cite{HHLNT2017}. In this paper, we study the asymptotic properties of the temporal gradient $u(t+\varepsilon, x)-u(t, x)$ at any fixed $t \ge 0$ and $x\in \mathbb R$, as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$. As applications, we deduce Khintchine's law of iterated logarithm, Chung's law of iterated logarithm, and a result on the $q$-variations of the temporal process $\{u(t, x)\}_{t \ge 0}$, where $x\in \mathbb R$ is fixed.</description>

      <title>Self-Normalized Moderate Deviations for Degenerate U-Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study self-normalized moderate deviations for degenerate { $U$}-statistics of order $2$. Let $\{X_i, i \geq 1\}$ be i.i.d. random variables and consider symmetric and degenerate kernel functions in the form $h(x,y)=\sum_{l=1}^{\infty} \lambda_l g_l (x) g_l(y)$, where $\lambda_l &gt; 0$, $E g_l(X_1)=0$, and $g_l (X_1)$ is in the domain of attraction of a normal law for all $l \geq 1$. Under the condition $\sum_{l=1}^{\infty}\lambda_l&lt;\infty$ and some truncated conditions for $\{g_l(X_1): l \geq 1\}$, we show that $ \text{log} P({\frac{\sum_{1 \leq i \neq j \leq n}h(X_{i}, X_{j})} {\max_{1\le l&lt;\infty}\lambda_l V^2_{n,l} }} \geq x_n^2) \sim - { \frac {x_n^2}{ 2}}$ for $x_n \to \infty$ and $x_n =o(\sqrt{n})$, where $V^2_{n,l}=\sum_{i=1}^n g_l^2(X_i)$. As application, a law of the iterated logarithm is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Mixing times for the open ASEP at the triple point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mixing times for the open asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) at the triple point. We show that the mixing time of the open ASEP on a segment of length $N$ for bias parameter $q$ is of order $N^{3/2+\kappa}$ if $1-q \asymp N^{-\kappa}$ for some $\kappa \in [0,\frac{1}{2})$, and the same result with poly-logarithmic corrections for $\kappa=\frac{1}{2}$. Our proof combines a fine analysis of the current of the open ASEP, moderate deviations of second class particles, the censoring inequality, and various couplings and multi-species extensions of the ASEP. Moreover, we establish a comparison between moderate deviations for the current of the open ASEP and the ASEP on the integers, as well as bounds on mixing times for the open ASEP in the weakly high density phase, which are of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this short article, we present a solution to one of the probability puzzles that Daniel Litt, a mathematician at the University of Toronto, posted on his X account earlier this year. The main goal of this note is to show how some of the typical concepts taught in an undergraduate probability course can be used to solve these types of probability problems, which sound simple, but can be very difficult to solve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to characterize the concept of monotonicity according to a direction related to a set of n random variables in terms of its associated n-copula C. We start establishing relationships in the bivariate and trivariate cases, which help to understand the extension to the multivariate case. Examples of copulas in all the studied cases are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An independent set may not contain both a vertex and one of its neighbours. This basic fact makes the uniform distribution over independent sets rather special. We consider the hard-core model, an essential generalization of the uniform distribution over independent sets. We show how its local analysis yields remarkable insights into the global structure of independent sets in the host graph, in connection with, for instance, Ramsey numbers, graph colourings, and sphere packings.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ count the number of $r$-stars in the random binomial graph $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. We determine, for fixed $r$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the asymptotics of $\log \mathbb{P}(X \ge (1 + \varepsilon)\mathbb{E} X)$ assuming only $\mathbb{E} X \to \infty$ and $p \to 0$ thus giving a first class of irregular graphs for which the upper tail problem for subgraph counts (stated by Janson and Ruci\'nski in 2004) is solved in the sparse setting.</description>

      <title>Benjamini-Schramm limits of high genus translation surfaces: research announcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the sequence of Masur-Smillie-Veech (MSV) distributed random translation surfaces, with area equal to genus, Benjamini-Schramm converges as genus tends to infinity. This means that for any fixed radius $r&gt;0$, if $X_g$ is an MSV-distributed random translation surface with area $g$ and genus $g$, and $o$ is a uniformly random point in $X_g$, then the radius-$r$ neighborhood of $o$ in $X_g$, as a pointed measured metric space, converges in distribution to the radius $r$ neighborhood of the root in a Poisson translation plane, which is a random pointed surface we introduce here. Along the way, we obtain bounds on statistical local geometric properties of translation surfaces, such as the probability that the random point $o$ has injectivity radius at most $r$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Controlling the low-temperature Ising model using spatiotemporal Markov decision theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the spatiotemporal Markov decision process (STMDP), a special type of Markov decision process that models sequential decision-making problems which are not only characterized by temporal, but also by spatial interaction structures. To illustrate the framework, we construct an STMDP inspired by the low-temperature two-dimensional Ising model on a finite, square lattice, evolving according to the Metropolis dynamics. We consider the situation in which an external decision maker aims to drive the system towards the all-plus configuration by flipping spins at specified moments in time. In order to analyze this problem, we construct an auxiliary MDP by means of a reduction of the configuration space to the local minima of the Hamiltonian. Leveraging the convenient form of this auxiliary MDP, we uncover the structure of the optimal policy by solving the Bellman equations in a recursive manner. Finally, we conduct a numerical study on the performance of the optimal policy obtained from the auxiliary MDP in the original Ising STMDP.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample properties of the trimmed mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trimmed mean of $n$ scalar random variables from a distribution $P$ is the variant of the standard sample mean where the $k$ smallest and $k$ largest values in the sample are discarded for some parameter $k$. In this paper, we look at the finite-sample properties of the trimmed mean as an estimator for the mean of $P$. Assuming finite variance, we prove that the trimmed mean is ``sub-Gaussian'' in the sense of achieving Gaussian-type concentration around the mean. Under slightly stronger assumptions, we show the left and right tails of the trimmed mean satisfy a strong ratio-type approximation by the corresponding Gaussian tail, even for very small probabilities of the order $e^{-n^c}$ for some $c&gt;0$. In the more challenging setting of weaker moment assumptions and adversarial sample contamination, we prove that the trimmed mean is minimax-optimal up to constants.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Empirical First-Passage Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-passage properties are central to the kinetics of target-search processes. Theoretical approaches so far primarily focused on predicting first-passage statistics for a given process or model. In practice, however, one faces the reverse problem of inferring first-passage statistics from, typically sub-sampled, experimental or simulation data. Obtaining trustworthy estimates from under-sampled data and unknown underlying dynamics remains a daunting task, and the assessment of the uncertainty is imperative. In this chapter, we highlight recent progress in understanding and controlling finite-sample effects in empirical first-passage times of reversible Markov processes. Precisely, we present concentration inequalities bounding from above the deviations of the sample mean for any sample size from the true mean first-passage time and construct non-asymptotic confidence intervals. Moreover, we present two-sided bounds on the range of fluctuations, i.e, deviations of the expected maximum and minimum from the mean in any given sample, which control uncertainty even in situations where the mean is a priori not a sufficient statistic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entropic regularizations of optimal transport problems under suitable summability assumptions on the point-wise transport cost. These summability assumptions already appear in the literature. However, we show that the weakest compactness conditions that can be derived are already enough to obtain the convergence of the regularized functionals. This approach allows us to characterize the variational limit of the regularization even when it does not converge to the original problem. The results apply also to problems with more than two marginals.</description>

      <title>Rough volatility, path-dependent PDEs and weak rates of convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the setting of stochastic Volterra equations, and in particular rough volatility models, we show that conditional expectations are the unique classical solutions to path-dependent PDEs. The latter arise from the functional It\^o formula developed by [Viens, F., &amp; Zhang, J. (2019). A martingale approach for fractional Brownian motions and related path dependent PDEs. Ann. Appl. Probab.]. We then leverage these tools to study weak rates of convergence for discretised stochastic integrals of smooth functions of a Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (0,1/2)$. These integrals approximate log-stock prices in rough volatility models. We obtain the optimal weak error rates of order~$1$ if the test function is quadratic and of order~$(3H+1/2)\wedge 1$ if the test function is five times differentiable; in particular these conditions are independent of the value of~$H$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G_N$ with vertex set $[N] = \{1,\dots,N\}$ for which the pair of vertices $i,j \in [N]$, $i\neq j$, is connected by an edge with probability $r_N(\tfrac{i}{N},\tfrac{j}{N})$, independently of other pairs of vertices. Here, $r_N\colon\,[0,1]^2 \to (0,1)$ is a symmetric function that plays the role of a reference graphon. Let $\lambda_N$ be the maximal eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of $G_N$. We show that if $\lim_{N\to\infty} \|r_N-r\|_\infty = 0$ for some limiting graphon $r\colon\,[0,1]^2 \to (0,1)$, then $\lambda_N/N$ satisfies a downward LDP with rate $\binom{N}{2}$ and an upward LDP with rate $N$. We identify the associated rate functions $\psi_r$ and $\widehat{\psi}_r$, and derive their basic properties.</description>

Abstract: We study large deviations in the context of stochastic gradient descent for one-hidden-layer neural networks with quadratic loss. We derive a quenched large deviation principle, where we condition on an initial weight measure, and an annealed large deviation principle for the empirical weight evolution during training when letting the number of neurons and the number of training iterations simultaneously tend to infinity. The weight evolution is treated as an interacting dynamic particle system. The distinctive aspect compared to prior work on interacting particle systems lies in the discrete particle updates, simultaneously with a growing number of particles.</description>

      <title>Cournot's for measure-theoretic probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of classical probability, Cournot's principle states that an event with probability very close to $1$ occurs nearly certainly in a single trial of an experiment. This principle has been considered by various authors as the only connection between mathematical probability and the real world of experiments.
  After Kolmogorov, classical probability has been replaced by measure-theoretic probability, where the classical definition of probability is no longer available, and probability spaces and experiments are separate entities that must be related in some way. In this context, the classical formulation of Cournot's principle is no longer appropriate.
  In this paper, a formulation of Cournot's principle appropriate for measure-theoretic probability is proposed. The main changes of the new formulation are: (1) the explicit definition of the empirical property of practical certainty, (2) the formulation of the principle as a criterion for relating probability measures and experiments, and (3) the explicit formulation of the product rule for independent trials. Particular attention has been paid to formulating the new version in a form that is as mathematically rigorous as possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multidimensional distributions with heavy tails attracted recently the attention of several papers on Applied Probability. However, the most of the works of the last decades are focused on multivariate regular variation, while the rest of the heavy-tailed distribution classes were not studied extensively. About the multivariate subexponentiality we can find several approximations, but none of them get established widely. Having in mind the single big jump and further the multivariate subexponentiality suggested by Samorodnitsky and Sun (2016), we introduce the multivariate long, dominatedly and constistently varying distribution classes. We examine the closure properties of these classes with respect to product convolution, to scale mixture and convolution of random vectors. Especially in the class of multivariate subexponential and dominatedly varying distributions we provide the asymptotic behavior of the random vector and its normalized Levy measure, through their linear combination, that leads to their characterization. Furthermore, we study the single big jump in finite and in random sums of random vectors, permitting some dependence structures, which contain the independence as special case. Finally, we present an application on the asymptotic evaluation of the present value of the total claims in a risk model, with common Poisson counting process, general financial factors and independent, identically distributed claims, with common multivariate subexponential distribution.</description>

Abstract: We extend the classical regularity theory of optimal transport to non-optimal transport maps generated by heat flow for perturbations of Gaussian measures. Considering probability measures of the form $d\mu(x) = \exp\left(-\frac{|x|^2}{2} + a(x)\right)dx$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ where $a$ has H\"older regularity $C^\beta$ with $\beta\geq 0$; we show that the Langevin map transporting the $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution onto $\mu$ achieves H\"older regularity $C^{\beta + 1}$, up to a logarithmic factor. We additionally present applications of this result to functional inequalities and generative modelling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a general Milstein-type scheme for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by Brownian motion and Poisson random measure and the associated system of interacting particles where drift, diffusion and jump coefficients may grow super-linearly in the state variable and linearly in the measure component. The strong rate of $\mathcal{L}^2$-convergence of the proposed scheme is shown to be arbitrarily close to one under appropriate regularity assumptions on the coefficients. For the derivation of the Milstein scheme and to show its strong rate of convergence, we provide an It\^o formula for the interacting particle system connected with the McKean-Vlasov SDE driven by Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. Moreover, we use the notion of Lions derivative to examine our results. The two-fold challenges arising due to the presence of the empirical measure and super-linearity of the jump coefficient are resolved by identifying and exploiting an appropriate coercivity-type condition.</description>

This is translated, mathematically, into a stochastic optimization problem over martingales that live on the $d$-dimensional subprobability simplex $\Delta$ and terminate on the vertices of $\Delta$ (so-called win-martingales), with a cost function related to a scaling limit of Shannon entropies. We uncover a surprising connection between this problem and the seemingly unrelated field of Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations: If $g$ solves \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} g(x)=\log \det\left(\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 g(x)\right), \quad \, \ \ \ \ \, \, \, \, x \in \Delta, \\ g(x)=\infty, \quad \quad \quad \quad \ \ \ \ \ \quad \quad \, \ \ \ \ \ x\in \partial \Delta, \end{cases} \end{equation*} then the winning-probability of the players in the most exciting game is described by $$dM_s=\sqrt{\frac{2 (\nabla^2 g(M_s))^{-1}}{1-s} } \, dB_s.$$ To formalize this, a detailed quantitative analysis of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for $g$ is crucial. This is then leveraged to prove that $M$ is indeed an optimal win-martingale.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of first passage percolation geodesics on planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the scaling limit of the geodesics to the root for the first passage percolation distance on random planar maps. We first describe the scaling limit of the number of faces along the geodesics. This result enables to compare the metric balls for the first passage percolation and the dual graph distance. It also enables to upperbound the diameter of large random maps. Then, we describe the scaling limit of the tree of first passage percolation geodesics to the root via a stochastic coalescing flow of pure jump diffusions. This stochastic flow also enables us to construct some random metric spaces which we conjecture to be the scaling limit of random planar maps with high degrees. The main tool in this work is a time-reversal of the uniform peeling exploration.</description>

      <title>Critical level set percolation for the GFF in $d&gt;6$: comparison principles and some consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic geometry of the critical percolation cluster induced by the level set of the metric Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ has been the subject of much recent activity. (Lupu, 2016) established that the critical percolation cluster has the same law as that in a Poisson loop soup where the intensity is dictated by the Green's function of the usual random walk. A sharp Euclidean one arm exponent was proven recently in (Cai and Ding, 2023), and subsequently in (Ganguly and Nam, 2024) other results about the chemical one arm exponent, volume growth and the Alexander-Orbach conjecture were established for all $d&gt;20.$
  In this article, we introduce new methods to obtain several sharp estimates about the intrinsic geometry which hold for all $d&gt;6$. We develop two primary comparison methods. The first involves a comparison of the extrinsic (Euclidean) and intrinsic metrics allowing estimates about the former to be transferrable to the latter. The second compares intrinsic geodesics to a class of modified paths which are non-backtracking in a certain loop sense. The latter is amenable to analysis using methods of bond percolation. We finally prove that such non-backtracking paths are not much longer than geodesics allowing us to establish comparable estimates for the geodesic. As applications of such methods, we establish, for all $d&gt;6,$ the chemical one-arm exponent, as well as an averaged version of a conjecture from (Werner, 2021) which asserts that deletion of loops with diameter larger than $r^{6/d}$ do not affect the connection probabilities between points at Euclidean distance $r.$ An important ingredient of independent interest is a local connectivity estimate which asserts that the connection probability between two points at distance $r$ remains, up to constants, unchanged even if the connecting path is confined to a ball of diameter comparable to $r.$</description>

      <title>Induced quasi-isometries of hyperbolic spaces, Markov chains, and acylindrical hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that quasi-isometries of (well-behaved) hierarchically hyperbolic groups descend to quasi-isometries of their maximal hyperbolic space. This has two applications, one relating to quasi-isometry invariance of acylindrical hyperbolicity, and the other a linear progress result for Markov chains. The appendix, by Jacob Russell, contains a partial converse under the (necessary) condition that the maximal hyperbolic space is one-ended.</description>

      <title>Structure of lower tails in sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the typical structure of a sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph conditioned on the lower tail subgraph count event. We show that in certain regimes, a typical graph sampled from the conditional distribution resembles the entropy minimizer of the mean field approximation in the sense of both subgraph counts and cut norm. The main ingredients are an adaptation of an entropy increment scheme of Kozma and Samotij, and a new stability for the solution of the associated entropy variational problem.
  The proof can be interpreted as a structural application of the new probabilistic hypergraph container lemma for sparser than average sets, and suggests a more general framework for establishing such typical behavior statements.</description>

      <title>Regularity and stability for the Gibbs conditioning principle on path space via McKean-Vlasov control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of diffusion processes interacting through their empirical distribution. Assuming that the empirical average of a given observable can be observed at any time, we derive regularity and quantitative stability results for the optimal solutions in the associated version of the Gibbs conditioning principle. The proofs rely on the analysis of a McKean-Vlasov control problem with distributional constraints. Some new estimates are derived for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and the Hessian of the log-density of diffusion processes, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Exact threshold and limiting distribution for non-linear Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For positive integers $r &gt; \ell \geq 1$, an $\ell$-cycle in an $r$-uniform hypergraph is a cycle where each edge consists of $r$ vertices and each pair of consecutive edges intersect in $\ell$ vertices. For $\ell \geq 2$, we determine the limiting distribution of the number of Hamilton $\ell$-cycles in an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random hypergraph. The behavior is distinguished in two cases:
  -When $\ell \geq 3$, the number of cycles concentrates when the expectation diverges and converges to a Poisson distribution when the expectation is constant.
  -When $\ell = 2$, the normalized number of cycles converges to a lognormal distribution when the expectation diverges and converges to a lognormal mixture of Poisson distributions when the expectation is constant.
  As a result we pin down the exact threshold for the appearance of non-linear Hamilton cycles in random hypergraphs, confirming a conjecture of Narayanan and Schacht.</description>
