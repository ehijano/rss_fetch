      <title>Feedback in Emerging extragAlactic Star clusTers, FEAST: JWST spots PAH destruction in NGC 628 during the emerging phase of star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence phase of young star clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628. We use JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations to create spatially resolved maps of the Pa$\alpha$-1.87 $\mu$m and Br$\alpha$-4.05 $\mu$m hydrogen recombination lines, as well as the 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extract 953 compact HII regions and analyze the PAH emission and morphology at ~10 pc scales in the associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). While HII regions remain compact, radial profiles help us to define three PAH morphological classes: compact (~ 42%), extended (~ 34%) and open (~24%). The majority of compact and extended PAH morphologies are associated with very young star clusters (&lt;5 Myr), while open PAH morphologies are mainly associated with star clusters older than 3 Myr. We observe a general decrease in the 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m PAH band emission as a function of cluster age, while their ratio remains constant with age out to 10 Myr and morphological class. The recovered PAH$_{3.3 \mu{\rm m}}$/PAH$_{7.7 \mu{\rm m}}$ ratio is lower than values reported in the literature for reference models and analyses conducted at larger physical scales. The 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m bands are typically associated to neutral and ionised PAHs, respectively. While we expected neutral PAHs to be suppressed in proximity of the ionizing source, the constant PAH$_{3.3 \mu{\rm m}}$/PAH$_{7.7 \mu{\rm m}}$ ratio would indicate that both families of molecules disrupt at similar rates in proximity of the HII regions.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals a dust-obscured galaxy merger at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a critical role in galaxy evolution - altering the size, morphology, dynamics and composition of galaxies. So far, galaxy mergers have mostly been identified through visual inspection of their rest-frame optical and NIR emission. But, dust can obscure this emission, resulting in the misclassification of mergers as single galaxies, and the incorrect interpretation of their baryonic properties. Having serendipitously discovered a dust-obscured galaxy merger at z = 1.17, we aim to determine the baryonic properties of the two merging galaxies, including the star formation rate, and stellar, molecular gas, and dust masses. Using Band 3 and 6 observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array (ALMA), and ancillary data, we study the morphology of this previously misclassified merger. We deblend the emission, derive the gas masses from CO observations, and model the spectral energy distributions, to determine the properties of each galaxy. Using the rare combination of ALMA CO(2-1), CO(5-4) and dust-continuum (rest-frame 520um) observations, we provide insights into the gas and dust content and ISM properties of each merger component. We find that only one of the two galaxies is highly dust-obscured, whereas both are massive (&gt; 10^10.5 Msun), highly star-forming (SFR = 60-900Msun/yr), have a moderate-to-low depletion time (tdepl &lt; 0.7Gyr) and high gas fraction ( fgas &gt;= 1). These properties can be interpreted as the positive impact of the merger. With this serendipitous discovery, we highlight the power of (sub)millimeter observations to identify and characterise the individual components of obscured galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>All-Sky Kinematics of the Distant Halo: The Reflex Response to the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is predicted to displace the inner Milky Way (MW), imprinting an apparent 'reflex motion' on the observed velocities of distant halo stars. We construct the largest all-sky spectroscopic dataset of luminous red giant stars from $50-160$ kpc, including a new survey of the southern celestial hemisphere. We fit the full 6D kinematics of our data to measure the amplitude and direction of the inner MW's motion towards the outer halo. The observed velocity grows with distance such that, relative to halo stars at $100$ kpc, the inner MW is lurching at $\approx 40$ km s$^{-1}$ towards a recent location along the LMC's past orbit. Our measurements align with N-body simulations of the halo's response to a $1.8 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$ LMC on first infall, suggesting that the LMC is at least 15% as massive as the MW. Our findings highlight the dramatic disequilibrium of the MW outskirts, and will enable more accurate measurements of the total mass of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Smallest Scale of Hierarchy Survey (SSH) III. Dwarf-dwarf satellite merging phenomena in the low-mass regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new deep, wide-field Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) $g$ and $r$ imaging data from the Smallest Scale of Hierarchy Survey (SSH) revealing previously undetected tidal features and stellar streams in the outskirts of six dwarf irregular galaxies (NGC 5238, UGC 6456, UGC 6541, UGC 7605, UGC 8638, and UGC 8760) with stellar masses in the range $1.2 \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ to $1.4 \times 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$. The six dwarfs are located 1-2 Mpc away from large galaxies, implying that the observed distortions are unlikely to be due to tidal effects from a nearby, massive companion. At the dwarfs' distances of $\sim$3-4 Mpc, the identified tidal features are all resolved into individual stars in the LBT images and appear to be made of a population older than 1-2 Gyr, excluding the possibility that they result from irregular and asymmetric star formation episodes that are common in gas-rich dwarf galaxies. The most plausible explanation is that we are witnessing the hierarchical merging assembling of these dwarfs with their satellite populations, a scenario also supported by the peculiar morphology and disturbed velocity field of their HI component. From the SSH sample we estimate a fraction of late type dwarfs showing signs of merging with satellites of $\sim$13\%, in agreement with other recent independent studies and theoretical predictions within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>oMEGACat III. Multi-band photometry and metallicities reveal spatially well-mixed populations within $\omega$ Centauri's half-light radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\omega$ Centauri, the most massive globular cluster in the Milky Way, has long been suspected to be the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that fell into the Galaxy a long time ago. There is considerable evidence for this scenario including a large spread in metallicity and an unusually large number of distinct sub-populations seen in photometric studies. In this work, we use new MUSE spectroscopic and HST photometric catalogs to investigate the underlying metallicity distributions as well as the spatial variations of the populations within the cluster up to its half-light radius. Based on 11,050 member stars, the [M/H] distribution has a median of $ (-1.614 \pm 0.003)$ dex and a large spread of $\sim$ 1.37 dex reaching from $ -0.67$ dex to $ -2.04$ dex for 99.7 % of the stars. In addition, we show the chromosome map of the cluster, which separates the red giant branch stars into different sub-populations, and analyze the sub-populations of the metal-poorest component. Finally, we do not find any metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and the different sub-populations are well mixed.</description>

      <title>The Extremely Metal Rich Knot of Stars at the Heart of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show with Gaia XP spectroscopy that extremely metal-rich stars in the Milky Way (EMR; $[M/H]_{XP} &gt; 0.5$) - but only those - are largely confined to a tight "knot" at the center of the Galaxy. This EMR knot is round in projection, has a fairly abrupt edge near $\sim 1.5$kpc, and is a dynamically hot system. This central knot also contains very metal-rich (VMR; $+0.2\le [M/H]_{XP} \le +0.4$) stars. However, in contrast to EMR stars, the bulk of VMR stars form an extended, highly flattened distribution in the inner Galaxy ($R_{\mathrm{GC}}\lesssim 5$ kpc). We draw on TNG50 simulations of Milky Way analogs for context and find that compact, metal-rich knots confined to $&lt;1.5$kpc are a universal feature. In typical simulated analogs, the top 5-10% most metal-rich stars are confined to a central knot; however, in our Milky Way data this fraction is only 0.1%. Dust-penetrating wide-area near-infrared spectroscopy, such as SDSS-V, will be needed for a rigorous estimate of the fraction of stars in the Galactic EMR knot. Why in our Milky Way only EMR giants are confined to such a central knot remains to be explained. Remarkably, the central few kiloparsecs of the Milky Way harbor both the highest concentration of metal-poor stars (the `poor old heart') and almost all EMR stars. This highlights the stellar population diversity at the bottom of galactic potential wells.</description>

      <title>UV Cooling via O VI Emission in the Superwind of M82 Observed with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined archival Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer data to search for far-ultraviolet emission lines in the starburst galaxy M82. The observations were made in an outflow region that extends beyond the galactic disk. We found the O VI $\lambda\lambda$ 1032, 1038 emission lines from the galaxy's southern outflow region. The O VI lines suggest that the outflowing warm-hot gas is undergoing radiative cooling. We measured a radial velocity of $\sim$420 km s$^{-1}$ from the O VI lines, which is faster than the velocity seen in H$\alpha$ observations. The O VI $\lambda$1038 emission line seems to be blended with the C II $\lambda$1037 emission line, which has a radial velocity of $\sim$300 km s$^{-1}$, similar to what is observed in H$\alpha$ observations. The outflow medium of M82 appears to be composed of gas in multiple phases with varying temperatures and kinematics. Future spectroscopic observations in high energy regimes covering a wider spatial area are necessary to understand better the properties of the warm-hot gas medium in the outflow.</description>

      <title>Unveiling gas phase H2NCO radical: Laboratory rotational spectroscopy and interstellar search toward IRAS 16293-2422</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The carbamoyl radical (H2NCO) is believed to play a central role in the ice-grain chemistry of crucial interstellar complex organic molecules as formamide and acetamide. Yet, little is known about this radical that remains elusive in laboratory gas-phase experiments. Aims. In order to enable interstellar searches of H2NCO, we have undertaken a mandatory laboratory characterisation of its pure rotational spectrum. Methods. We report the gas-phase laboratory detection of H2NCO, produced by H-atom abstraction from formamide, using pure rotational spectroscopy at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths. Millimetre-wave data were acquired using chirped-pulse Fourier-transform spectroscopy while submillimetre-wave ones were obtained using Zeeman-modulated spectroscopy. Experimental measurements were guided by quantum-chemical calculations at the $\omega$B97X-D/cc-pVQZ level of theory. Interstellar searches for the radical have been undertaken on the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) towards the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293-2422. Results. From the assignment and fit of experimental transitions up to 660 GHz, reliable spectroscopic parameters for H2NCO in its ground vibrational state have been derived, enabling accurate spectral predictions. No transitions of the radical were detected on the PILS survey. The inferred upper limit shows that H2NCO abundance is at least 60 times below that of formamide and 160 times below that of HNCO in this source; a value that is in agreement with predictions from a physico-chemical model of this young protostar.</description>

      <title>Feedback in Emerging Extragalactic Star Clusters (JWST--FEAST): Calibration of Star Formation Rates in the Mid-Infrared with NGC 628</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New JWST near-infrared imaging of the nearby galaxy NGC 628 from the Cycle 1 program JWST-FEAST is combined with archival JWST mid-infrared imaging to calibrate the 21 $\mu$m emission as a star formation rate indicator (SFR) at $\sim$120 pc scales. The Pa$\alpha$ ($\lambda$1.8756 $\mu$m) hydrogen recombination emission line targeted by FEAST provides a reference SFR indicator that is relatively insensitive to dust attenuation, as demonstrated by combining this tracer with the HST H$\alpha$ imaging. Our analysis is restricted to regions that appear compact in nebular line emission and are sufficiently bright to mitigate effects of both age and stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function. We find that the 21 $\mu$m emission closely correlates with the nebular line emission, with a power-law with exponent=1.07$\pm$0.01, in agreement with past results. We calibrate a hybrid SFR indicator using a combination of H$\alpha$ and 24 $\mu$m (extrapolated from 21 $\mu$m) tracers and derive the proportionality constant between the two tracers $b=0.095\pm0.007$, which is $\sim$ 3-5 times larger than previous derivations using large regions/entire galaxies. We model these discrepancies as an increasing contribution to the dust heating by progressively older stellar populations for increasing spatial scales, in agreement with earlier findings that star formation is hierarchically distributed in galaxies. Thus, use of hybrid SFR indicators requires prior knowledge of the mean age of the stellar populations dominating the dust heating, which makes their application uncertain. Conversely, non-linear calibrations of SFRs from L(24) alone are more robust, with a factor $\lesssim$2.5 variation across the entire range of L(24) luminosities from HII regions to galaxies.</description>

      <title>LIGHTS. Survey Overview and a Search for Low Surface Brightness Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the LIGHTS (LBT Imaging of Galactic Halos and Tidal Structures) survey, which currently includes 25 nearby galaxies that are on average $\sim$ 1 mag fainter than the Milky Way, and a catalog of 54 low central surface brightness (24 $&lt; \mu_{0,g}$/mag arcsec$^{-2} &lt; 28$) satellite galaxy candidates, most of which were previously uncatalogued. The depth of the imaging exceeds the full 10-year depth of the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find, after applying completeness corrections, rising numbers of candidate satellites as we approach the limiting luminosity (M$_r \sim -8$ mag) and central surface brightness ($\mu_{0,g} \sim 28$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$). Over the parameter range we explore, each host galaxy (excluding those that are in overdense regions, apparently groups) has nearly 4 such candidate satellites to a projected radius of $\sim$ 100 kpc. These objects are mostly just at or beyond the reach of spectroscopy unless they are H I rich or have ongoing star formation. We identify 3, possibly 4, ultra-diffuse satellite galaxies (UDGs; effective radius $ &gt; 1.5$ kpc). This incidence rate falls within expectations of the extrapolation of the published relationship between the number of UDGs and host halo mass. Lastly, we visually identify 12 candidate satellites that host a nuclear star cluster (NSC). The NSC occupation fraction for the sample (12/54) matches that published for satellites of early-type galaxies, suggesting that the parent's morphological type plays at most a limited role in determining the NSC occupation fraction.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: Massive slow rotator population in place by $z \sim 0.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the `Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral field spectroscopy' (MAGPI) survey to investigate whether galaxies have evolved in the distribution of their stellar angular momentum in the past 3-4 Gyr, as probed by the observational proxy for spin, $\lambda_{R}$. We use 2D stellar kinematics to measure $\lambda_{R}$ along with detailed photometric models to estimate galaxy ellipticity. The combination of these measurements quantifies the kinematic classes of `fast rotators' and the rarer `slow rotators', which show no regular rotation in their line-of-sight velocity fields. We compare 51 MAGPI galaxies with $\log_{10} (M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_\odot) &gt; 10$ to carefully drawn samples of MaNGA galaxies in the local Universe, selected to represent possible descendants of the MAGPI progenitors. The EAGLE simulations are used to identify possible evolutionary pathways between the two samples, explicitly accounting for progenitor bias in our results and the varied evolutionary pathways a galaxy might take between the two epochs. We find that the occurrence of slow rotating galaxies is unchanged between the MAGPI ($z \sim 0.3$) and MaNGA ($z \sim 0$) samples, suggesting the massive slow rotator population was already in place $\sim 4$ Gyr ago and has not accumulated since. There is a hint of the MAGPI sample having an excess of high $\lambda_{R}$ galaxies compared to the MaNGA sample, corresponding to more ordered rotation, but statistically the samples are not significantly different. The large-scale stellar kinematics, as quantified through the $\lambda_{R}$ parameter, of galaxies at $z \sim 0.3$ have already evolved into the diversity of structures seen today in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Optical polarimetry study of Lambda-Orionis star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optical polarimetric study of a nearby star-forming region, Lambda-Orionis, to map plane-of-the-sky magnetic field geometry to understand the magnetized evolution of the HII region and associated small molecular clouds. We made multi-wavelength polarization observations of 34 bright stars distributed across the region. R-band polarization measurements focused on small molecular clouds BRC 17 and BRC 18 located at the periphery of the HII region are also presented. The magnetic field lines exhibit a large-scale ordered orientation consistent with the Planck sub-mm polarization measurements. The magnetic field lines in both the BRCs are found to be roughly in north-south directions; however, a larger dispersion is noticed in the orientation for BRC 17 compared to BRC 18. Using structure-function analysis, the strength of the plane-of-the-sky component of the magnetic field is estimated as $\sim$28 $\mu$G for BRC 17 and $\sim$40 $\mu$G for BRC 18. The average dust grain size and the mean value of the total-to-selective extinction ratio (R$_{V}$) in the HII region are found to be $\sim$0.51 $\pm$ 0.05 $\mu$m and $\sim$2.9 $\pm$ 0.3, respectively. The distance of the whole HII region is estimated as $\sim$392 $\pm$ 8 pc by combining astrometry information from GAIA EDR3 for YSOs associated with BRCs and confirmed members of central cluster Collinder 69.</description>

      <title>Local versus global environment: the suppression of star formation in the vicinity of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to examine where, how and why the quenching of star formation begins in the outskirts of galaxy clusters, we investigate the de-projected radial distribution of a large sample of quenched and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to $30R_{500}$ around clusters. We identify the SFG sample using radio continuum emission from the Low-Frequency Array Two-metre Sky Survey. We find that the SFG fraction starts to decrease from the field fraction as far out as $10R_{500}$, well outside the virial radius of the clusters. We investigate how the SFG fraction depends on both large-scale and local environments, using radial distance from a cluster to characterise the former, and distance from 5th nearest neighbour for the latter. The fraction of SFGs in high-density local environments is consistently lower than that found in low-density local environments, indicating that galaxies' immediate surroundings have a significant impact on star formation. However, for high-mass galaxies -- and low mass galaxies to a lesser extent -- high-density local environments appear to act as a protective barrier for those SFGs that survived this pre-processing, shielding them from the external quenching mechanisms of the cluster outskirts. For those galaxies that are not in a dense local environment, the global environment causes the fraction of SFGs to decrease toward the cluster centre in a manner that is independent of galaxy mass. Thus, the fraction of SFGs depends on quite a complex interplay between the galaxies' mass, their local environment, and their more global cluster-centric distance.</description>

      <title>Observation of HI around three satellite galaxies of the M31 with the FAST: Andromeda II, NGC 205, and NGC 185</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exceptional sensitivity of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we conducted observations of the neutral hydrogen (HI) in the Circular Galactical Medium (CGM) of Andromeda's (M31) satellite galaxies, specifically Andromeda II, NGC 205, and NGC 185. Initially, three drift scans were executed for these satellites, with a detection limit of $4\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ ( approximately $1.88\times10^3 M_{\odot}$ of HI mass), followed by a more in-depth scan of a specific region. We discovered a C-shaped HI arc structure sharing a position and line-of-sight velocity similar to a stellar ring structure around Andromeda II, hinting at a potential connection with Andromeda II. In the context of NGC 205, we identified two mass concentrations in the northeast direction, which could be indicative of tidal streams resulting from the interaction between this galaxy and M31. These new lumps discovered could be very helpful in solving the missing interstellar medium (ISM) problem for NGC 205. Observations regarding NGC 185 are consistent with previous studies, and we did not detect any additional HI material around this galaxy. These observational results enhance our understanding of the evolution of these satellite galaxies and provide insight into their historical interactions with the M31 galaxy.</description>

      <title>Constrained cosmological simulations of the Local Group using Bayesian hierarchical field-level inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach based on Bayesian field-level inference capable of resolving individual galaxies within the Local Group (LG), enabling detailed studies of its structure and formation via posterior simulations. We extend the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm with a multi-resolution approach, allowing us to reach smaller mass scales and apply observational constraints based on LG galaxies. Our updated data model simultaneously accounts for observations of mass tracers within the dark haloes of the Milky Way (MW) and M31, their observed separation and relative velocity, and the quiet surrounding Hubble flow represented through the positions and velocities of galaxies at distances from one to four Mpc. Our approach delivers representative posterior samples of $\Lambda$CDM realisations that are statistically and simultaneously consistent with all these observations, leading to significantly tighter mass constraints than found if the individual datasets are considered separately. In particular, we estimate the virial masses of the MW and M31 to be $\log_{10}(M_{200c}/M_\odot) = 12.07\pm0.08$ and $12.33\pm0.10$, respectively, their sum to be $\log_{10}(\Sigma M_{200c}/M_\odot)= 12.52\pm0.07$, and the enclosed mass within spheres of radius $R$ to be $\log_{10}(M(R)/M_\odot)= 12.71\pm0.06$ and $12.96\pm0.08$ for $R=1$ Mpc and 3 Mpc, respectively. The M31-MW orbit is nearly radial for most of our $\Lambda$CDM LG's, and most lie in a dark matter sheet that aligns approximately with the Supergalactic Plane, even though the surrounding density field was not used explicitly as a constraint. The approximate simulations employed in our inference are accurately reproduced by high-fidelity structure formation simulations, demonstrating the potential for future high-resolution, full-physics $\Lambda$CDM posterior simulations of LG look-alikes.</description>

      <title>Understanding the chemistry of the young stellar object G29.862-0.0044</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, we have investigated the star-forming region G29.96$-$0.02 where the massive young stellar object (MYSO) G29.862$-$0.0044 (hereafter G29) is embedded in a hot molecular core. In one of them, of multiwavelength nature, using data from the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE), data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), and photometric data from NIRI-Gemini, G29 was investigated at different spatial scales. However, the intriguing morphology of G29 in the near-infrared, together with the distribution of the associated molecular gas, reveals that the star-formation scenario is far from being understood. This work incorporates the analysis of the emission of several molecular lines acquired with ALMA that were not previously examined (eg.,~CH$_{3}$OH, HC$_{3}$N, H$_{ 2}$CO, C$^{34}$S, H$_{2}$CS) as well as a new determination of the temperature of the region. Additionally, we present the progress of results obtained through new observations in the near-infrared, in this case spectroscopic, using NIFS-Gemini, and in radio continnum obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). This research allows us to carry out a detailed chemical study of the region, which will contribute to the understanding of the physical processes involved in the high-mass star formation.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Observations of Sgr A*. II. 2019 July 21 and 26</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the final two days of a multiwavelength campaign of Sgr A* observing in the radio, submillimeter, infrared, and X-ray bands in July 2019. Sgr A* was remarkably active, showing multiple flaring events across the electromagnetic spectrum. We detect a transient $\sim35$-minute periodicity feature in Spitzer Space Telescope light curves on 21 July 2019. Time-delayed emission was detected in ALMA light curves, suggesting a hotspot within the accretion flow on a stable orbit. On the same night, we observe a decreased flux in the submillimeter light curve following an X-ray flare detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and model the feature with an adiabatically expanding synchrotron hotspot occulting the accretion flow. The event is produced by a plasma $0.55~R_{\text{S}}$ in radius with an electron spectrum $p=2.84$. It is threaded by a $\sim130$ Gauss magnetic field and expands at $0.6\%$ the speed of light. Finally, we reveal an unambiguous flare in the infrared, submillimeter, and radio, demonstrating that the variable emission is intrinsically linked. We jointly fit the radio and submillimeter light curves using an adiabatically expanding synchrotron hotspot and find it is produced by a plasma with an electron spectrum $p=0.59$, $187$ Gauss magnetic field, and radius $0.47~R_{\text{S}}$ that expands at $0.029c$. In both cases, the uncertainty in the appropriate lower and upper electron energy bounds may inflate the derived equipartition field strengths by a factor of 2 or more. Our results confirm that both synchrotron- and adiabatic-cooling processes are involved in the variable emission's evolution at submillimeter and infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Baryonification extended to thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryonification algorithms model the impact of galaxy formation and feedback on the matter field in gravity-only simulations by adopting physically motivated parametric prescriptions. In this paper, we extend these models to describe gas temperature and pressure, allowing for a self-consistent modelling of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, weak gravitational lensing, and their cross-correlation, down to small scales. We validate our approach by showing that it can simultaneously reproduce the electron pressure, gas, stellar, and dark matter power spectra as measured in all BAHAMAS hydrodynamical simulations. Specifically, with only two additional free parameters, we can fit the electron pressure auto- and cross-power spectra at 10% while reproducing the suppression in the matter power spectrum induced by baryons at the per cent level, for different AGN feedback strengths in BAHAMAS. Furthermore, we reproduce BAHAMAS convergence and thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich angular power spectra within 1% and 10% accuracy, respectively, down to l = 5000. When used jointly with cosmological rescaling algorithms, the baryonification presented here will allow a fast and accurate exploration of cosmological and astrophysical scenarios. Therefore, it can be employed to create mock catalogues, lightcones, and large training sets for emulators aimed at interpreting forthcoming multi-wavelength observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Orbits and Dynamical Masses for Six Binary Systems in the Hyades Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report long baseline interferometric observations with the CHARA Array that resolve six previously known double-lined spectroscopic binary systems in the Hyades cluster, with orbital periods ranging from 3 to 358 days: HD 27483, HD 283882, HD 26874, HD 27149, HD 30676, and HD 28545. We combine those observations with new and existing radial-velocity measurements, to infer the dynamical masses for the components as well as the orbital parallaxes. For most stars the masses are determined to better than 1%. Our work significantly increases the number of systems with mass determinations in the cluster. We find that while current models of stellar evolution for the age and metallicity of the Hyades are able to reproduce the overall shape of the empirical mass-luminosity relation, they overestimate the $V$-band fluxes by about 0.1 mag between 0.5 and 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The disagreement is smaller in $H$, and near zero in $K$, and depends somewhat on the model. We also make use of the TESS light curves to estimate rotation periods for our targets, and detect numerous flares in one of them (HD 283882), estimating an average flaring rate of 0.44 events per day.</description>

      <title>X-ray bright AGN in local dwarf galaxies: insights from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the heart of virtually every massive galaxy, it remains debated whether dwarf galaxies also commonly host SMBHs. Because low-mass galaxies may retain a memory of the assembly history of their black holes, probing the black hole occupation fraction of local dwarf galaxies might offer insights into the growth and seeding mechanisms of the first black holes. In this work, we exploit the Western half of the eROSITA all-sky survey (covering $20,000~\rm{deg^2}$) and compile a catalog of accreting SMBHs in local ($D&lt;200$~Mpc) dwarf galaxies. After cleaning our sample from cosmic X-ray background sources, X-ray binaries, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, we identify 74 AGN-dwarf galaxy pairs. Using this large and uniform sample, we derive a luminosity function of dwarf galaxy AGN, fitting it with a power law function and obtaining ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}L_{\rm X} = (15.9\pm2.2)\times L_{\rm X}^{-1.63\pm0.05}$. Measuring the offset between the centroid of dwarf galaxies and the X-ray sources, we find that about $50\%$ of the AGN are likely off-nuclear, in agreement with theoretical predictions. We also compare the black hole-to-stellar mass relation of the AGN in our sample with the local and high-redshift relations, finding that our sources better adhere to the former. This suggests that local AGN across different mass scales underwent a similar growth history. Finally, we compare our sources with semi-analytical models: while our sample is too shallow to distinguish between different seeding models, it favors a growth mechanism linked to the star-formation rate of the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Imputation of Missing Photometric Data and Photometric Redshift Estimation for CSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimation requires support from multi-band observational data. However, in the actual process of astronomical observations and data processing, some sources may have missing observational data in certain bands for various reasons. This could greatly affect the accuracy and reliability of photo-$z$ estimation for these sources, and even render some estimation methods unusable. The same situation may exist for the upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). In this study, we employ a deep learning method called Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) to impute the missing photometric data in CSST, aiming to reduce the impact of data missing on photo-$z$ estimation and improve estimation accuracy. Our results demonstrate that using the GAIN technique can effectively fill in the missing photometric data in CSST. Particularly, when the data missing rate is below 30\%, the imputation of photometric data exhibits high accuracy, with higher accuracy in the $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $y$ bands compared to the $NUV$ and $u$ bands. After filling in the missing values, the quality of photo-$z$ estimation obtained by the widely used Easy and Accurate Zphot from Yale (EAZY) software is notably enhanced. Evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of photo-$z$ estimation, including the catastrophic outlier fraction ($f_{out}$), the normalized median absolute deviation ($\rm {\sigma_{NMAD}}$), and the bias of photometric redshift ($bias$), all show some degree of improvement. Our research will help maximize the utilization of observational data and provide a new method for handling sample missing values for applications that require complete photometry data to produce results.</description>

      <title>The first Palomar Gattini-IR catalog of J-band light curves: construction and public data release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Palomar Gattini-IR is a wide-field, synoptic infrared time domain survey covering $\approx 15000$ sq. deg. of the sky at $\approx 1-3$ night cadence to a depth of $J\approx 13.0$ and $\approx 14.9$ Vega mag in and outside the Galactic plane, respectively. Here, we present the first data release of $J$-band light curves of 2MASS sources within the survey footprint covering approximately the first four years of operations. We describe the construction of the source catalog based on the 2MASS point sources, followed by exposure filtering criteria and forced PSF photometry. The catalog contains light curves of $\approx 286$ million unique sources with 2MASS magnitudes of $J &lt; 15.5$ mag, with a total of $\approx 50$ billion photometric measurements and $\approx 20$ billion individual source detections at signal-to-noise-ratio $&gt; 3$. We demonstrate the photometric fidelity of the catalog by i) quantifying the magnitude-dependent accuracy and uncertainty of the photometry with respect to 2MASS and ii) comparing against forced PGIR aperture photometry for known variable sources. We present simple filtering criteria for selecting reliable photometric measurements as well as example Python notebooks for users. This catalog is the largest compilation of nightly cadence, synoptic infrared light curves to date, comparable to those in the largest optical surveys, providing a stepping stone to upcoming infrared surveys in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Colour standardisation of Type Ia Supernovae and its dependence on environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Type Ia supernova cosmology transitions from a statistics dominated to a systematics dominated era, it is crucial to understand leftover unexplained uncertainties affecting their luminosity, such as the ones stemming from astrophysical biases. Indeed, SNe Ia are standardisable candles, whose absolute magnitude reach a 0.15~mag scatter once empirical correlations with their lightcurve stretch and colour and with their environment are accounted for. In this paper, we investigate how the standardisation process of SNe Ia depends on environment, to ultimately reduce their scatter in magnitude, focusing on colour standardisation. We use the volume-limited ZTF SN Ia DR2 sample, which offers unprecedented statistics for the low redshift ($z&lt;0.06$) range. We first study the colour distribution, focusing on the effects of dust, to then select a dustless subsample of objects from low stellar mass environments and from the outskirts of their host galaxies. We then look at the colour-residuals relation and its associated parameter $\beta$. Finally, we investigate the colour dependency of the environment-dependent magnitude offsets (steps), to try to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic colour origin. Our sample probes well the red tail of the colour distribution, up to $c=0.8$. The dustless sample exhibits a significantly lower red tail ($4.6\sigma$) in comparison to the whole sample. This suggests that reddening above $c\geq0.2$ is dominated by host interstellar dust absorption. Looking at the colour-residuals relation, we find it to be linear with lightcurve colour. We show hints of a potential evolution of $\beta$ with host stellar mass at a $2.5\sigma$ level. Finally, unlike recent claims from the literature, we see no evolution of steps as a function of lightcurve colour, suggesting that dust may not be the dominating mechanism responsible for the environmental dependency of SNe Ia magnitude.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. By employing a methodology to stack tracking data in combination with Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain parameter recovery tests, we show that the mission will be sensitive to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-1}$ Hz, provided that tracking data is taken consistently over a large fraction of the cruise duration. Thus, the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. Within this assumption, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(1 - 100)$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

Abstract: Astrochemical models are important tools to interpret observations of molecular and atomic species in different environments. However, these models are time-consuming, precluding a thorough exploration of the parameter space, leading to uncertainties and biased results. Using neural networks to simulate the behavior of astrochemical models is a way to circumvent this problem, providing fast calculations that are based on real astrochemical models. In this paper, we present a fast neural emulator of the astrochemical code Nautilus based on conditional neural fields. The resulting model produces the abundance of 192 species for arbitrary times between 1 and 10$^7$ years. Uncertainties well below 0.2 dex are found for all species, while the computing time is of the order of 10$^4$ smaller than Nautilus. This will open up the possibility of performing much more complex forward models to better understand the physical properties of the interstellar medium. As an example of the power of these models, we ran a feature importance analysis on the electron abundance predicted by Nautilus. We found that the electron density is coupled to the initial sulphur abundance in a low density gas. Increasing the initial sulphur abundance from a depleted scenario to the cosmic abundance leads to an enhancement of an order of magnitude of the electron density. This enhancement can potentially influence the dynamics of the gas in star formation sites.</description>

      <title>Dark matter distribution in Milky Way-analog galaxies</title>

Abstract: Our current understanding of how dark matter (DM) is distributed within the Milky Way halo, particularly in the solar neighborhood, is based on either careful studies of the local stellar orbits, model assumptions on the global shape of the MW halo, or from direct acceleration measurements. In this work, we undertake a study of external galaxies, with the intent of providing insight to the DM distribution in MW-analog galaxies. For this, we carefully select a sample of galaxies similar to the MW, based on maximum atomic hydrogen (HI) rotational velocity ($v_{\rm max,HI}$= 200-280 km s$^{-1}$) and morphological type (Sab-Sbc) criteria. With a need for deep, highly-resolved HI, our resulting sample is composed of 5 galaxies from the VIVA and THINGS surveys. To perform our baryonic analysis, we use deep Spitzer mid-IR images at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m from the S$^4$G survey. Based on the dynamical three-dimensional modeling software $^{3D}$Barolo, we construct rotation curves (RCs) and derive the gas and stellar contributions from the galaxy's gaseous- and stellar-disks mass surface density profiles. Through a careful decomposition of their RCs into their baryonic (stars, gas) and DM components, we isolate the DM contribution by using an MCMC-based approach. Based on the Sun's location and the MW's R$_{25}$, we define the corresponding location of the solar neighborhood in these systems. We put forward a window for the DM density ($\rho_{dm}$ = 0.21-0.55 GeV cm$^{-3}$) at these galactocentric distances in our MW analog sample, consistent with the values found for the MW's local DM density, based on more traditional approaches found in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We use high-resolution MHD simulations of isolated disk galaxies to investigate the co-evolution of magnetic fields with a self-regulated, star-forming interstellar medium (ISM). The simulations are conducted using the Ramses AMR code on the standard Agora initial condition, with gas cooling, star formation and feedback. We run galaxies with a variety of initial magnetic field strengths. The fields grow rapidly and achieve approximate saturation within 500 Myr, but at different levels. The galaxies reach a quasi-steady state, with slowly declining star formation due to both gas consumption and increases in the field strength at intermediate ISM densities. We connect this behaviour to differences in the gas properties and overall structure of the galaxies. In particular, strong fields limit feedback bubbles. Different cases support the ISM using varying combinations of magnetic pressure, turbulence and thermal energy. Magnetic support is closely linked to stellar feedback in the case of initially weak fields but not for initially strong fields. The spatial distribution of these supports is also different in each case, and this is reflected in the stability of the gas disk. We relate this back to the overall distribution of star formation in each case. We conclude that a weak initial field can grow to produce a realistic model of a local disk galaxy, but starting with typical field strengths will not.</description>

      <title>Galaxies with grains: unraveling dust evolution and extinction curves with hydrodynamical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model for dust evolution in the RAMSES code for simulations of galaxies with a resolved multiphase interstellar medium. Dust is modelled as a fluid transported with the gas component, and is decomposed into two sizes, 5 nm and 0.1 $\mu\rm m$, and two chemical compositions for carbonaceous and silicate grains. Using a suite of isolated disc simulations with different masses and metallicities, the simulations can explore the role of these processes in shaping the key properties of dust in galaxies. The simulated Milky Way analogue reproduces the dust-to-metal mass ratio (DTM), depletion factors, size distribution and extinction curves of the Milky Way. Galaxies with lower metallicities reproduce the observed decrease in the DTM with metallicity at around a few 0.1 $\rm Z_\odot$. This break in the DTM corresponds to a galactic gas metallicity threshold that marks the transition from an ejecta-dominated to an accretion-dominated grain growth, and that is different for silicate and carbonaceous grains, with $\simeq$ 0.1 $\rm Z_\odot$ and $\simeq$ 0.5 $\rm Z_\odot$ respectively. This leads to more Magellanic Cloud-like extinction curves, i.e. with steeper slopes in the ultraviolet and a weaker bump feature at 217.5 nm, in galaxies with lower masses and lower metallicities. Steeper slopes in these galaxies are caused by the combination of the higher efficiency of gas accretion by silicate relative to carbonaceous grains and by the low rates of coagulation that preserves the amount of small silicate grains. Weak bumps are due to the overall inefficient accretion growth of carbonaceous dust at low metallicity, whose growth is mostly supported by the release of large grains in SN ejecta. We also show that the formation of CO molecules is a key component to limit the ability of carbonaceous dust to grow, in particular in low-metallicity gas-rich galaxies.</description>

      <title>FROST-CLUSTERS -- I. Hierarchical star cluster assembly boosts intermediate-mass black hole formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters assemble hierarchically from sub-clusters with a universal power-law cluster mass function. We study the consequences of such assembly for the formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at low metallicities ($Z=0.01\;Z_\mathrm{\odot}$) with our updated N-body code BIFROST based on the hierarchical fourth-order forward integrator. BIFROST integrates few-body systems using secular and regularized techniques including post-Newtonian equations of motion up to order PN3.5 and gravitational-wave recoil kicks for BHs. Single stellar evolution is treated using the fast population synthesis code SEVN. We evolve three cluster assembly regions with $N_\mathrm{tot} = 1.70$--$2.35 \times 10^6$ stars following a realistic IMF in $\sim$1000 sub-clusters for $t=50$ Myr. IMBHs with masses up to $m_\bullet \sim 2200\:M_\mathrm{\odot}$ form rapidly mainly via the collapse of very massive stars (VMSs) assembled through repeated collisions of massive stars followed by growth through tidal disruption events and BH mergers. No IMBHs originate from the stars in the initially most massive clusters. We explain this by suppression of hard massive star binary formation at high velocity dispersions and the competition between core collapse and massive star life-times. Later the IMBHs form subsystems resulting in gravitational-wave BH-BH, IMBH-BH and IMBH-IMBH mergers with a $m_\bullet\sim1000\:M_\mathrm{\odot}$ gravitational-wave detection being the observable prediction. Our simulations indicate that the hierarchical formation of massive star clusters in metal poor environments naturally results in formation of potential seeds for supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Emission Line Predictions for Mock Galaxy Catalogues: a New Differentiable and Empirical Mapping from DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple, differentiable method for predicting emission line strengths from rest-frame optical continua using an empirically-determined mapping. Extensive work has been done to develop mock galaxy catalogues that include robust predictions for galaxy photometry, but reliably predicting the strengths of emission lines has remained challenging. Our new mapping is a simple neural network implemented using the JAX Python automatic differentiation library. It is trained on Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Early Release data to predict the equivalent widths (EWs) of the eight brightest optical emission lines (including H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O II], and [O III]) from a galaxy's rest-frame optical continuum. The predicted EW distributions are consistent with the observed ones when noise is accounted for, and we find Spearman's rank correlation coefficient $\rho_s &gt; 0.87$ between predictions and observations for most lines. Using a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique (UMAP), we show that this is true for galaxies across the full range of observed spectral energy distributions. In addition, we find that adding measurement uncertainties to the predicted line strengths is essential for reproducing the distribution of observed line-ratios in the BPT diagram. Our trained network can easily be incorporated into a differentiable stellar population synthesis pipeline without hindering differentiability or scalability with GPUs. A synthetic catalogue generated with such a pipeline can be used to characterise and account for biases in the spectroscopic training sets used for training and calibration of photo-$z$'s, improving the modelling of systematic incompleteness for the Rubin Observatory LSST and other surveys.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All IX. Sulfur elemental abundance in the Orion Bar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main problems in astrochemistry is determining the amount of sulfur in volatiles and refractories in the interstellar medium. The detection of the main sulfur reservoirs (icy H$_2$S and atomic gas) has been challenging, and estimates are based on the reliability of models to account for the abundances of species containing less than 1% of the total sulfur. The high sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope provides an unprecedented opportunity to estimate the sulfur abundance through the observation of the [S I] 25.249 $\mu$m line. We used the [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m, [S IV] 10.5 $\mu$m, and [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m lines to estimate the amount of sulfur in the ionized and molecular gas along the Orion Bar. For the theoretical part, we used an upgraded version of the Meudon photodissociation region (PDR) code to model the observations. New inelastic collision rates of neutral atomic sulfur with ortho- and para- molecular hydrogen were calculated to predict the line intensities. The [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m and [S IV] 10.5 $\mu$m lines are detected over the imaged region with a shallow increase (by a factor of 4) toward the HII region. We estimate a moderate sulfur depletion, by a factor of $\sim$2, in the ionized gas. The corrugated interface between the molecular and atomic phases gives rise to several edge-on dissociation fronts we refer to as DF1, DF2, and DF3. The [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m line is only detected toward DF2 and DF3, the dissociation fronts located farthest from the HII region. The detailed modeling of DF3 using the Meudon PDR code shows that the emission of the [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m line is coming from warm ($&gt;$ 40 K) molecular gas located at A$_{\rm V}$ $\sim$ 1$-$5 mag from the ionization front. Moreover, the intensity of the [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m line is only accounted for if we assume the presence of undepleted sulfur.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Pop~III stars' chemical signature in neutral gas at z~6. A study based on the E-XQR-30 spectroscopic sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the metal enrichment signatures attributed to the first generation of stars (PopIII) in the Universe, focusing on the E-XQR-30 sample. We aim to identify traces of Pop III metal enrichment by analyzing neutral gas in the interstellar medium of primordial galaxies and their satellite clumps, detected in absorption. To chase the chemical signature of PopIII stars, we studied metal absorption systems in the E-XQR-30 sample, selected through the detection of the OI absorption line at 1302A. The OI line is a reliable tracer of HI and allowed us to overcome the challenges posed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest's increasing saturation at redshifts above $\sim5$ to identify Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems (DLA). We detected and analyzed 29 OI systems at $z\geq5.4$, differentiating between proximate DLAs (PDLA) and intervening DLAs. Voigt function fits were applied to obtain ionic column densities, and relative chemical abundances were determined for 28 systems. These were then compared with the predictions of theoretical models. Our findings expand the study of OI systems at $z\geq5.4$ fourfold. No systematic differences were observed in the average chemical abundances between PDLAs and intervening DLAs. The chemical abundances in our sample align with literature systems at $z&gt;4.5$, suggesting a similar enrichment pattern for this class of absorption systems. A comparison between these DLA-analogues at $4.5&lt;z&lt;6.5$ with a sample of very metal-poor DLAs at $2&lt;z&lt;4.5$ shows in general similar average values for the relative abundances, with the exception of [C/O], [Si/Fe] and [Si/O] which are significantly larger for the high-$z$ sample. Furthermore, the dispersion of the measurements significantly increases in the high-redshift bin. This increase is predicted by the theoretical models and indicates a potential retention of PopIII signatures in the probed gas. (Abridged)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present significant improvements to our previous work on noise reduction in {\sl Herschel} observation maps by defining sparse filtering tools capable of handling, in a unified formalism, a significantly improved noise reduction as well as a deconvolution in order to reduce effects introduced by the limited instrumental response (beam). We implement greater flexibility by allowing a wider choice of parsimonious priors in the noise-reduction process. More precisely, we introduce a sparse filtering and deconvolution approach approach of type $l^2$-$l^p$, with $p &gt; 0$ variable and apply it to a larger set of molecular clouds using {\sl Herschel} 250 $\mu $m data in order to demonstrate their wide range of application. In the {\sl Herschel} data, we are able to use this approach to highlight extremely fine filamentary structures and obtain singularity spectra that tend to show a significantly less $\log$-normal behavior and a filamentary nature in the less dense regions. We also use high-resolution adaptive magneto-hydrodynamic simulation data to assess the quality of deconvolution in such a simulated beaming framework.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mass Segregation of the Binary Stars in the Open Cluster NGC 6819</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for mass segregation in the intermediate-aged open cluster NGC 6819 within a carefully identified sample of probable cluster members. Using photometry from the Gaia, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS surveys as inputs for a Bayesian statistics software suite, BASE-9, we identify a rich population of (photometric) binaries and derive posterior distributions for the cluster age, distance, metallicity and reddening as well as star-by-star photometric membership probabilities, masses and mass ratios (for binaries). Within our entire sample, we find 2632 cluster members and 777 binaries. We then select a main-sequence 'primary sample' with 14.85 &lt; G &lt; 19.5 containing 1342 cluster members and 250 binaries with mass ratios q &gt; 0.5, to investigate for mass segregation. Within this primary sample, we find the binary radial distribution is significantly shifted toward the cluster center as compared to the single stars, resulting in a binary fraction that increases significantly toward the cluster core. Furthermore, we find that within the binary sample, more massive binaries have more centrally concentrated radial distributions than less massive binaries. The same is true for the single stars. We verify the expectation of mass segregation for this stellar sample in NGC 6819 through both relaxation time arguments and by investigating a sophisticated N-body model of the cluster. Importantly, this is the first study to investigate mass segregation of the binaries in the open cluster NGC 6819.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers can take place close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) while being in a bound orbit around the SMBH. In this paper, we study such bound triple systems and show that including the strong gravity effects of describing the SMBH with a Kerr metric can significantly modify the dynamics, as compared to a Newtonian point particle description of the SMBH. We extract the dynamics of the system, using a quadrupole approximation to the tidal forces due to the SMBH. We exhibit how the gyroscope precession is built into this dynamics, and find the secular Hamiltonian by both averaging over the inner and outer orbits, the latter being the orbit of the BBH around the SMBH. We study the long-time-scale dynamics, including the periastron precession and GW radiation-reaction of the binary system, finding that the strong gravity effects of the SMBH can enhance the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism, resulting in more cycles, higher maximum eccentricity, and thereby a shorter merger time, particularly when the binary is close to, or at, the innermost stable orbit of the SMBH. We end with an analysis of the peak frequency of the GW emission from the binary system, highlighting possible observable signatures in the LISA and ET frequency bands.</description>

Abstract: The number of exoplanets detected using gravitational microlensing technique is currently larger than 200, which enables population studies. Microlensing is uniquely sensitive to low-mass planets orbiting at separations of several astronomical units, a parameter space that is not accessible to other planet-detection techniques, as well as free-floating planets, not orbiting around any star. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art knowledge on the demographics of exoplanets detected with microlensing, with a particular emphasis on their occurrence rates. We also summarize the current knowledge about free-floating planets, an elusive population of objects that seem to be more common than ordinary, gravitationally bound exoplanets.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS): Linked accretion and ejection in a Class I protobinary system</title>

Abstract: Accretion and ejection sets the outcome of the star and planet formation process. The mid-infrared wavelength range offers key tracers of those processes that were difficult to detect and spatially resolve in protostars until now. We aim to characterize the interplay between accretion and ejection in the low-mass Class I protobinary system TMC1, comprising two young stellar objects: TMC1-W and TMC1-E with 85 au separation. With the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) - Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) observations in 5 - 28 $\mu$m range, we measure intensities of emission lines of H$_2$, atoms and ions, e.g., [Fe II] and [Ne II], and HI recombination lines. We detect H$_2$ outflow coming from TMC1-E, with no significant H$_2$ emission from TMC1-W. The H$_2$ emission from TMC1-E outflow appears narrow and extends to wider opening angles with decreasing E$_{up}$ from S(8) to S(1) rotational transitions, indicating a disk wind origin. The outflow from TMC1-E protostar shows spatially extended emission lines of [Ne II], [Ne III], [Ar II], and [Ar III], with their line ratios consistent with UV radiation as a source of ionization. With ALMA, we detect accretion streamer infalling from $&gt;$ 1000 au scales onto the TMC1-E component. TMC1-W protostar powers a collimated jet, detected with [Fe II] and [Ni II] consistent with energetic flow. A much weaker ionized jet is observed from TMC1-E. TMC1-W is associated with strong emission from hydrogen recombination lines, tracing the accretion onto the young star. Observations of a binary Class I protostellar system show that the two processes are clearly intertwined, with accretion from the envelope onto the disk influencing a wide-angle wind ejected on disk scales, while accretion from the protostellar disk onto the protostar is associated with the source launching a collimated high-velocity jet within the innermost regions of the disk.</description>

      <title>The Redshift Evolution of the Binary Black Hole Mass Distribution from Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors are unveiling a population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts $z \approx 1$, and are starting to constrain how the BBH population evolves with redshift. We present predictions for the redshift evolution of the BBH mass and spin distributions for systems originating from dense star clusters. Utilizing a grid of 144 state-of-the-art dynamical models for globular clusters, we demonstrate that BBH merger rates peak at higher redshifts for larger black hole primary masses $M_1$. Specifically, for $M_1\gtrsim40\,M_{\odot}$, the BBH merger rate reaches its peak at redshift $z\approx2.1$, while for $M_1\lesssim20\,M_{\odot}$, the peak occurs at $z\approx1.1$, assuming that the cluster formation rate peaks at $z=2.2$. The average BBH primary mass also increases from $\sim 10\,M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$ to $\sim 30\,M_{\odot}$ at $z=10$. We show that $\sim 20\%$ BBHs contain massive remnants from next-generation mergers, with this fraction increasing (decreasing) for larger (smaller) primary masses. This difference is not large enough to significantly alter the effective spins of the BBH population originating from globular clusters, and we find that their effective spin distribution does not evolve across cosmic time. These findings can be used to distinguish BBHs from dense star clusters by future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Conservation of distortion of gravitationally lensed images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently hypothesized that a distortion parameter exists such that its signed sum for all images of singular gravitational lensing of a source vanishes identically [K. S. Virbhadra, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 106}, 064038 (2022)]. We found a distortion parameter (the ratio of the tangential to radial magnifications) that satisfied the hypothesis for the images of Schwarzschild lensing with flying colors. We now show that another distortion parameter (the difference of tangential and radial magnifications) also magnificently supports our hypothesis when we perform computations with the primary-secondary and relativistic images. The distortion parameters, which satisfy the aesthetically appealing hypothesis, will likely aid in developing gravitational lensing theory. Finally, we discuss the conservation of distortion of images in gravitational lensing.</description>
