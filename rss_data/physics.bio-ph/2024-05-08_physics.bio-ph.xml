      <title>Metabolism, information, and viability in a simulated physically-plausible protocell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical experimental design issues connecting energy transduction and inheritable information within a protocell are explored and elucidated. The protocell design utilizes a photo-driven energy transducer (a ruthenium complex) to turn resource molecules into building blocks, in a manner that is modulated by a combinatorial DNA-based co-factor. This co-factor molecule serves as part of an electron relay for the energy transduction mechanism, where the charge-transport rates depend on the sequence that contains an oxo-guanine. The co-factor also acts as a store of inheritable information due to its ability to replicate non-enzymatically through template-directed ligation. Together, the energy transducer and the co-factor act as a metabolic catalyst that produces co-factor DNA building blocks as well as fatty acids (from picolinium ester and modified DNA oligomers), where the fatty acids self-assemble into vesicles on which exterior surface both the co-factor (DNA) and the energy transducer are anchored with hydrophobic tails. Here we use simulations to study how the co-factor sequence determines its fitness as reflected by charge transfer and replication rates. To estimate the impact on the protocell, we compare these rates with previously measured metabolic rates from a similar system where the charge transfer is directly between the ruthenium complex and the oxo-guanine (without DNA replication and charge transport). Replication and charge transport turn out to have different and often opposing sequence requirements. Functional information of the co-factor molecules is used to probe the feasibility of randomly picking co-factor sequences from a limited population of co-factors molecules, where a good co-factor can enhance both metabolic biomass production and its own replication rate.</description>

      <title>Clustering and spatial distribution of mitochondria in dendritic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal dendrites form densely branched tree architectures through which mitochondria must be distributed to supply the cell's energetic needs. Dendritic mitochondria circulate through the tree, undergoing fusion and fission to form clusters of varying sizes. We present a mathematical model for the distribution of such actively-driven particles in a branched geometry. Our model demonstrates that `balanced' trees (wherein cross-sectional area is conserved across junctions and thicker branches support more bushy subtrees) enable symmetric yet distally enriched particle distributions and promote dispersion into smaller clusters. These results highlight the importance of tree architecture and radius-dependent fusion in governing the distribution of neuronal mitochondria.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules under Earth's upper mantle conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How life started on Earth is a long-time unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses ranging from outer space to seabed. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions of NH3, H2O, H2, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10 - 13 GPa, 1000 -1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumption that larger organic molecules might readily dissociate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, our findings support the "RNA world" hypothesis, as we observed the exclusive formation of the 5-membered-ring form of ribose. By exploring the depths of Earth's interior, we have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which life may have originated. These findings have contributed to our evolving understanding of the fundamental conditions necessary for life to arise on our planet.</description>

      <title>Unclocklike biological oscillators with frequency memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entrainment experiments on the vertebrate segmentation clock have revealed that embryonic oscillators actively change their internal frequency to adapt to the driving signal. This is neither consistent with a one-dimensional clock model nor with a limit-cycle model, but rather suggests a new "unclocklike" behavior. In this work, we propose simple biologically realistic descriptions of such internal frequency adaptation, where a phase oscillator activates a memory variable controlling the oscillator's frequency. We study two opposite limits for the control of the memory variable, one with a smooth phase-averaging memory field, and the other with a pulsatile, phase-dependent activation. Both models recapitulate intriguing properties of the entrained segmentation clock, such as very broad Arnold tongues and an entrainment phase plateauing with detuning. We compute analytically multiple properties of such systems, such as the entrainment phases and cycle shapes. We further describe new phenomena, including hysteresis in entrainment, bistability in the frequency of the entrained oscillator, and probabilistic entrainment. Our work shows oscillators with frequency memory can exhibit new classes of unclocklike properties, that can be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Lipid-mediated hydrophobic gating in the BK potassium channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-conductance, calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel lacks the typical intracellular bundle-crossing gate present in most ion channels of the 6TM family. This observation, initially inferred from Ca$^{2+}$-free-pore accessibility experiments and recently corroborated by a CryoEM structure of the non-conductive state, raises a puzzling question: how can gating occur in absence of steric hindrance? To answer this question, we carried out molecular simulations and accurate free energy calculations to obtain a microscopic picture of the sequence of events that, starting from a Ca$^{2+}$-free state leads to ion conduction upon Ca$^{2+}$ binding. Our results highlight an unexpected role for annular lipids, which turn out to be an integral part of the gating machinery. Due to the presence of fenestrations, the "closed" Ca$^{2+}$-free pore can be occupied by the methyl groups from the lipid alkyl chains. This dynamic occupancy triggers and stabilizes the nucleation of a vapor bubble into the inner pore cavity, thus hindering ion conduction. By contrast, Ca$^{2+}$ binding results into a displacement of these lipids outside the inner cavity, lowering the hydrophobicity of this region and thus allowing for pore hydration and conduction. This lipid-mediated hydrophobic gating rationalizes several seemingly problematic experimental observations, including the state-dependent pore accessibility of blockers.</description>

      <title>Impact of phylogeny on the inference of functional sectors from protein sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins has revealed groups of coevolving amino acids called sectors. These groups of amino-acid sites feature collective correlations in their amino-acid usage, and they are associated to functional properties. Modeling showed that natural selection on an additive functional trait of a protein is generically expected to give rise to a functional sector. These modeling results motivated a principled method, called ICOD, which is designed to identify functional sectors, as well as mutational effects, from sequence data. However, a challenge for all methods aiming to identify sectors from multiple sequence alignments is that correlations in amino-acid usage can also arise from the mere fact that homologous sequences share common ancestry, i.e. from phylogeny. Here, we generate controlled synthetic data from a minimal model comprising both phylogeny and functional sectors. We use this data to dissect the impact of phylogeny on sector identification and on mutational effect inference by different methods. We find that ICOD is most robust to phylogeny, but that conservation is also quite robust. Next, we consider natural multiple sequence alignments of protein families for which deep mutational scan experimental data is available. We show that in this natural data, conservation and ICOD best identify sites with strong functional roles, in agreement with our results on synthetic data. Importantly, these two methods have different premises, since they respectively focus on conservation and on correlations. Thus, their joint use can reveal complementary information.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimation of the normalized mutual information of multidimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the linear Pearson correlation coefficient represents a well-established normalized measure to quantify the interrelation of two stochastic variables $X$ and $Y$, it fails for multidimensional variables such as Cartesian coordinates. Avoiding any assumption about the underlying data, the mutual information $I(X, Y)$ does account for multidimensional correlations. However, unlike the normalized Pearson correlation, it has no upper bound ($I \in [0, \infty)$), i.e., it is not clear if say, $I = 0.4$ corresponds to a low or a high correlation. Moreover, the mutual information (MI) involves the estimation of high-dimensional probability densities (e.g., six-dimensional for Cartesian coordinates), which requires a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, such as the estimator by Kraskov et al. [Phys. Rev. E 69, 066138 (2004)]. As existing methods to normalize the MI cannot be used in connection with this estimator, a new approach is presented, which uses an entropy estimation method that is invariant under variable transformations. The algorithm is numerically efficient and does not require more effort than the calculation of the (un-normalized) MI. After validating the method by applying it to various toy models, the normalized MI between the $C_{\alpha}$ -coordinates of T4 lysozyme is considered and compared to a correlation analysis of inter-residue contacts.</description>

      <title>Fourier synthesis optical diffraction tomography for kilohertz rate volumetric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many biological and soft matter processes occur at high speeds in complex 3D environments, and developing imaging techniques capable of elucidating their dynamics is an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, we introduce Fourier Synthesis Optical Diffraction Tomography (FS-ODT), a novel approach for high-speed quantitative phase imaging capable of recording the 3D refractive index at kilohertz rates. FS-ODT introduces new pattern generation and inverse computational strategies that multiplex tens of illumination angles in a single tomogram, dramatically increasing the volumetric imaging rate. We validate FS-ODT performance by imaging samples of known composition and accurately recovering the refractive index for increasing pattern complexity. We further demonstrate the capabilities of FS-ODT for probing complex systems by studying the hindered diffusion of colloids in solution and the motility of single-cellular bacterial swimmers. We believe that FS-ODT is a promising approach for unlocking challenging imaging regimes in biophysics and soft matter that have been little explored, including understanding the physical interactions of colloids and microswimmers with their viscous 3D environment and the interplay between these stimuli and the molecular response of biological systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Fluctuation-Response Relations of Nonequilibrium Dynamics: A Trajectory Information Geometry Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the universal principles governing the response of complex systems to environmental changes is crucial for predicting and controlling their behavior. While fluctuation-dissipation relations have been established for systems near equilibrium, a general framework for understanding the responsiveness of systems far from steady states remains elusive. Here, we introduce a novel approach based on the information geometry of stochastic trajectories to derive a set of universal thermodynamic bounds on the response of any Markov system, regardless of its proximity to steady states. This theory establishes a new paradigm in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, providing a unified perspective on the behavior of non-stationary systems, from biological processes to engineered devices, and paving the way for designing complex responsiveness in far-from-equilibrium systems.</description>
