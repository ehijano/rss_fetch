      <title>Quasiclassical theory of superconducting spin-splitter effects and spin-filtering via altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conducting altermagnets have recently emerged as intriguing materials supporting strongly spin-polarized currents without magnetic stray fields. We demonstrate that altermagnets enable three key functionalities, merging superconductivity and spintronics. The first prediction is a controllable supercurrent-induced edge magnetization, which acts like a dissipationless spin-splitter effect. The second and third predictions are a Cooper pair spin-splitter and a filtering effect, respectively. These effects allow for spatial separation of triplet pairs with opposite spin-polarizations and spin-selective tunneling of Cooper pairs. We derive a quasiclassical theory with associated boundary conditions that describe these phenomena and explain how they can be experimentally verified. Our results open a new path for spatial control of spin signals via triplet Cooper pairs using hybrid superconductor-altermagnet devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Bilayer and Trilayer Nickelate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to the pressurized high-temperature superconductivity, bilayer and trilayer nickelate superconductors Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n = 2 and 3) exhibit many intriguing properties at ambient pressure, such as orbital-dependent electronic correlation, non-Fermi liquid behavior, and density-wave transitions. Here, using ultrafast reflectivity measurement, we observe a drastic difference between the ultrafast dynamics of the bilayer and trilayer nickelates at ambient pressure. Firstly, we observe a coherent phonon mode in La4Ni3O10 involving the collective vibration of La, Ni, and O atoms, which is absent in La3Ni2O7. Secondly, the temperature-dependent relaxation time diverges near the density-wave transition temperature of La4Ni3O10, in drastic contrast to kink-like changes in La3Ni2O7. Moreover, we estimate the electron-phonon coupling constants to be 0.05~0.07 and 0.12~0.16 for La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10, respectively, suggesting a relatively minor role of electron-phonon coupling in the electronic properties of Lan+1NinO3n+1. Our work not only sheds light on the relevant microscopic interaction but also establishes a foundation for further studying the interplay between superconductivity and density-wave transitions in nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Two-Dimentional Systems with Unconventional Rashba Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional system with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, it is well-known that superconductivity can have mixed spin-singlet and -triplet parity, and the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-tripet pairing is parallel to $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Here, we propose a model to describe a two-dimensional system with unconventional Rashba bands and study its superconductivity. We show that the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-tripet pairing can be either parallel or perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling depending on the different pairing interaction. We also propose a junction to generate tunneling spin current depending on the direction of $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector. It provides a detecable evidence to distinguish these two different but very similar pairing channels. Furthermore, we find this model can give arise to a subleading spin-singlet chiral $p$-wave topological superconducting state. More significantly, we find that such unconventional Rashba bands and unconventional superconudcting pairings can be realized on surface of some superconducting topological materials, such as trigonal layered PtBi$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of the New Medium-Entropy Alloy V4Ti2W with a Body-Centered Cubic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium- and high-entropy alloy (MEA and HEA) superconductors have attracted considerable interest since their discovery. This paper reports the superconducting properties of ternary tungsten-containing MEA V4Ti2W for the first time. V4Ti2W is a type II superconductor with a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. Experimental results of resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity indicate that the superconducting transition temperature of the MEA V4Ti2W is roughly 5.0 K. The critical magnetic fields at the upper and lower ends are 9.93(2) T and 40.7(3) mT, respectively. Interestingly, few BCC MEA superconductors with VEC greater than 4.8 have been found. The addition of tungsten leads to a VEC of 4.83 e/a for V4Ti2W, which is rarely higher than the 4.8 value. Adding tungsten element expands the variety of MEA alloys, which may improve the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials and even superconducting properties. This material could potentially offer a new platform for the investigation of innovative MEA and HEA superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in kagome metal ThRu3Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the physical properties of ThRu$_3$Si$_2$ featured with distorted Ru kagome lattice. The combined experiments of resistivity, magnetization and specific heat reveal bulk superconductivity with $T_{\rm{c}}$ = 3.8 K. The specific heat jump and calculated electron-phonon coupling indicate a moderate coupled BCS superconductor. In comparison with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, the calculated electronic structure in ThRu$_3$Si$_2$ shows an electron-doping effect with electron filling lifted from 100 meV below flat bands to 300 meV above it. This explains the lower superconducting transition temperature and weaker electron correlations observed in ThRu$_3$Si$_2$. Our work suggests the $T_{\rm{c}}$ and electronic correlations in kagome superconductor could have intimate connection with the flat bands.</description>

      <title>A first-principles study and mesoscopic modeling of two-dimensional spin and orbital fluctuations in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of FeSe within density-functional theory at the generalized gradient approximation level. First, we studied how the bandwidth of the d-bands at the Fermi energy are renormalized by adding simple corrections: Hubbard U, Hunds J and by introducing long-range magnetic orders. We found that introducing either a striped or a staggered dimer antiferromagnetic order brings the bandwidths -- which are starkly overestimated at the generalized gradient approximation level -- closer to those experimentally observed. Second, for the ferromagnetic, the striped, checkerboard and the staggered dimer antiferromagnetic order, we investigate the change in magnetic formation energy with local magnetic moment of Fe at a pressure up to 6 GPa. The bilinear and biquadratic exchange energies are derived from the Heisenberg model and noncollinear first-principles calculations, respectively. We found a non-trivial behavior of the spin-exchange parameters on the magnetization, and we put forward a field-theory model that rationalizes these results in terms of two-dimensional spin and orbital fluctuations. The character of these fluctuations can be either that of a standard density wave or a topological vortex. Topological vortexes can result in mesoscopic magnetization structures.</description>

      <title>Light-induced switching between singlet and triplet superconducting states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the search for topological triplet-pairing superconductivity has remained a challenge, recent developments in optically stabilizing metastable superconducting states suggest a new route to realizing this elusive phase. Here, we devise a testable theory of competing superconducting orders that permits ultrafast switching to an opposite-parity superconducting phase in centrosymmetric crystals with strong spin-orbit coupling. Using both microscopic and phenomenological models, we show that dynamical inversion symmetry breaking with a tailored light pulse can induce odd-parity (spin triplet) order parameter oscillations in a conventional even-parity (spin singlet) superconductor, which when driven strongly can send the system to a competing minimum in its free energy landscape. Our results provide new guiding principles for engineering unconventional electronic phases using light, suggesting a fundamentally non-equilibrium route toward realizing topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Time reversal invariant topological 1D and 2D superconductors: doubling the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Oppen proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a doubled version of the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Open proposals thereby obtaining time reversal invariant p-wave superconductivity in both 1D and 2D. This construction is much like the Kane-Mele spin Hall model which is a time reversal invariant doubling of the Haldane model. We show that the low energy effective action for these doubled versions of the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Open models corresponds to a single band p-wave time reversal invariant superconductors with pseudo spin degree of freedom instead of spin degree of freedom. There are Majorana fermions at the ends of wires or in vortex cores of these superconductors. Furthermore these are shown to be stable to small perturbations. In the supplement we present physical realization of the system with cold atoms and show a related "no-go" theorem given in Haim et. al. (2019) has too restrictive assumptions to apply to this proposal.</description>
