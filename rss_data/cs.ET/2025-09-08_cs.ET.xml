      <title>Analyzing Gait Adaptation with Hemiplegia Simulation Suits and Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To advance the development of assistive and rehabilitation robots, it is essential to conduct experiments early in the design cycle. However, testing early prototypes directly with users can pose safety risks. To address this, we explore the use of condition-specific simulation suits worn by healthy participants in controlled environments as a means to study gait changes associated with various impairments and support rapid prototyping. This paper presents a study analyzing the impact of a hemiplegia simulation suit on gait. We collected biomechanical data using a Vicon motion capture system and Delsys Trigno EMG and IMU sensors under four walking conditions: with and without a rollator, and with and without the simulation suit. The gait data was integrated into a digital twin model, enabling machine learning analyses to detect the use of the simulation suit and rollator, identify turning behavior, and evaluate how the suit affects gait over time. Our findings show that the simulation suit significantly alters movement and muscle activation patterns, prompting users to compensate with more abrupt motions. We also identify key features and sensor modalities that are most informative for accurately capturing gait dynamics and modeling human-rollator interaction within the digital twin framework.</description>

      <title>UAV-Based Intelligent Traffic Surveillance System: Real-Time Vehicle Detection, Classification, Tracking, and Behavioral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage, low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of 90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively. Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling, vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics. Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware, infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation smart cities.</description>

      <title>Towards Personalized Explanations for Health Simulations: A Mixed-Methods Framework for Stakeholder-Centric Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) approaches such as agent-based models hold significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments. However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models' complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers, and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of summaries.</description>

      <title>Histogram Driven Amplitude Embedding for Qubit Efficient Quantum Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a compact and hardware efficient method for compressing color images using near term quantum devices. The approach segments the image into fixed size blocks called bixels, and computes the total intensity within each block. A global histogram with B bins is then constructed from these block intensities, and the normalized square roots of the bin counts are encoded as amplitudes into an n qubit quantum state. Amplitude embedding is performed using PennyLane and executed on real IBM Quantum hardware. The resulting state is measured to reconstruct the histogram, enabling approximate recovery of block intensities and full image reassembly. The method maintains a constant qubit requirement based solely on the number of histogram bins, independent of the resolution of the image. By adjusting B, users can control the trade off between fidelity and resource usage. Empirical results demonstrate high quality reconstructions using as few as 5 to 7 qubits, significantly outperforming conventional pixel level encodings in terms of qubit efficiency and validating the practical application of the method for current NISQ era quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fourier Transform Based Denoising: Unitary Filtering for Enhanced Speech Clarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum-inspired denoising framework that integrates the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) into classical audio enhancement pipelines. Unlike conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based methods, QFT provides a unitary transformation with global phase coherence and energy preservation, enabling improved discrimination between speech and noise. The proposed approach replaces FFT in Wiener and spectral subtraction filters with a QFT operator, ensuring consistent hyperparameter settings for fair comparison. Experiments on clean speech, synthetic tones, and noisy mixtures across diverse signal to noise ratio (SNR) conditions, demonstrate statistically significant gains in SNR, with up to 15 dB improvement and reduced artifact generation. Results confirm that QFT based denoising offers robustness under low SNR and nonstationary noise scenarios without additional computational overhead, highlighting its potential as a scalable pathway toward quantum-enhanced speech processing.</description>

      <title>Classical optimization with imaginary time block encoding on quantum computers: The MaxCut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems in finance, physics and computer science are typically very hard to tackle in classical computing and quantum computing could help speed up computations and provide efficient methods for tackling large problems. Typically, to treat the problem with a quantum computer, the optimal solution is cast as the ground state of a diagonal Hamiltonian. We develop a new method, called ITE-BE, based on a recent imaginary time algorithm, which requires no variational parameter optimization as all parameters can be derived analytically from the target Hamiltonian. We also demonstrate that our method can be successfully combined with other quantum algorithms such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). For illustration, here we study the MaxCut problem. We find that the QAOA ansatz increases the post-selection success of ITE-BE, and shallow QAOA circuits, when boosted with ITE-BE, achieve better performance than deeper QAOA circuits. For the special case of the transverse initial state, we adapt our block encoding scheme to allow for a deterministic application of the first layer of the circuit.</description>

      <title>Mainframe-Style Channel Controllers for Modern Disaggregated Memory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or "far" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.
  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.
  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.</description>
