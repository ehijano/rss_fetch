      <title>Coding for the unsourced B-channel with erasures: enhancing the linked loop code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [1], the linked loop code (LLC) is presented as a promising code for the unsourced A-channel with erasures (UACE). The UACE is an unsourced multiple access channel in which active users' transmitted symbols are erased with a given probability and the channel output is obtained as the union of the non-erased symbols. In this paper, we extend the UACE channel model to the unsourced B-channel with erasures (UBCE). The UBCE differs from the UACE in that the channel output is the multiset union, or bag union, of the non-erased input symbols. In other words, the UBCE preserves the symbol multiplicity of the channel output while the UACE does not. Both the UACE and UBCE find applications in modeling aspects of unsourced random access. The LLC from [1] is enhanced and shown to outperform the tree code over the UBCE. Findings are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Outage Probability in Network Coding Based Cooperative Wireless Networks over Nakagami-m Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an accurate closed-form analytic expression of the outage probability for each source-destination (S-D) pair in the two S-D pairs two relays wireless network, where cooperative network coding is applied over Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. For different values of the shape parameter $m$, our analytic relation is validated with Monte-Carlo simulations of the outage probability using the overall equivalent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within each source-destination pair. The outage probability is also provided for the extended versions of the network consisting of multiple relays and multiple S-D pairs. Furthermore, we investigate the role of varying the fading factor ($m$ values) on different links in the end-to-end outage probability performance, which yields interesting results that may be crucial for relay selection and power allocation procedures. Moreover, we derive the diversity order for the generalized extended version of cooperative network coded wireless networks.</description>

      <title>On additive codes over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove a Griesmer type bound for additive codes over finite fields. This new bound gives an upper bound on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they obtain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the non-fractional case. We also provide some exhaustive computational results over small fields and dimensions.</description>

      <title>Self-orthogonal flags of codes and translation of flags of algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flag $C_0 \subsetneq C_1 \cdots \subsetneq C_s \subsetneq {\mathbb F}_q^n $ of linear codes is said to be self-orthogonal if the duals of the codes in the flag satisfy $C_{i}^\perp=C_{s-i}$, and it is said to satisfy the isometry-dual property with respect to an isometry vector ${\bf x}$ if $C_i^\perp={\bf x} C_{s-i}$ for $i=1, \dots, s$. We characterize complete (i.e. $s=n$) flags with the isometry-dual property by means of the existence of a word with non-zero coordinates in a certain linear subspace of ${\mathbb F}_q^n$. For flags of algebraic geometry (AG) codes we prove a so-called translation property of isometry-dual flags and give a construction of complete self-orthogonal flags, providing examples of self-orthogonal flags over some maximal function fields. At the end we characterize the divisors giving the isometry-dual property and the related isometry vectors showing that for each function field there is only a finite number of isometry vectors and that they are related by cyclic repetitions.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Codebook Design for RIS-Assisted MU-MISO Communications: Implementation and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides a new electromagnetic response control solution, which can proactively reshape the characteristics of wireless channel environments. In RIS-assisted communication systems, the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) and the optimization of reflecting coefficients constitute major design challenges. To address these issues, codebook-based solutions have been developed recently, which, however, are mostly environment-agnostic. In this paper, a novel environment-aware codebook protocol is proposed, which can significantly reduce both pilot overhead and computational complexity, while maintaining expected communication performance. Specifically, first of all, a channel training framework is introduced to divide the training phase into several blocks. In each block, we directly estimate the composite end-to-end channel and focus only on the transmit beamforming. Second, we propose an environment-aware codebook generation scheme, which first generates a group of channels based on statistical CSI, and then obtains their corresponding RIS configuration by utilizing the alternating optimization (AO) method offline. In each online training block, the RIS is configured based on the corresponding codeword in the environment-aware codebook, and the optimal codeword resulting in the highest sum rate is adopted for assisting in the downlink data transmission. Third, we analyze the theoretical performance of the environment-aware codebook-based protocol taking into account the channel estimation errors. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to verify our theoretical analysis and the performance of the proposed scheme. In particular, the simulation results demonstrate that our protocol is more competitive than conventional environment-agnostic codebooks.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Multiuser Communications based on Sparse Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers near-field multiuser communications based on sparse arrays (SAs). First, for the uniform SAs (USAs), we analyze the beam gains of channel steering vectors, which shows that increasing the antenna spacings can effectively improve the spatial resolution of the antenna arrays to enhance the sum rate of multiuser communications. Then, we investigate nonuniform SAs (NSAs) to mitigate the high multiuser interference from the grating lobes of the USAs. To maximize the sum rate of near-field multiuser communications, we optimize the antenna positions of the NSAs, where a successive convex approximation-based antenna position optimization algorithm is proposed. Moreover, we find that the channels of both the USAs and the NSAs show uniform sparsity in the defined surrogate distance-angle (SD-A) domain. Based on the channel sparsity, an on-grid SD-A-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SDA-OMP) algorithm is developed to estimate multiuser channels. To further improve the resolution of the SDA-OMP, we also design an off-grid SD-A-domain iterative super-resolution channel estimation algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Ridge interpolators in correlated factor regression models -- exact risk analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider correlated \emph{factor} regression models (FRM) and analyze the performance of classical ridge interpolators. Utilizing powerful \emph{Random Duality Theory} (RDT) mathematical engine, we obtain \emph{precise} closed form characterizations of the underlying optimization problems and all associated optimizing quantities. In particular, we provide \emph{excess prediction risk} characterizations that clearly show the dependence on all key model parameters, covariance matrices, loadings, and dimensions. As a function of the over-parametrization ratio, the generalized least squares (GLS) risk also exhibits the well known \emph{double-descent} (non-monotonic) behavior. Similarly to the classical linear regression models (LRM), we demonstrate that such FRM phenomenon can be smoothened out by the optimally tuned ridge regularization. The theoretical results are supplemented by numerical simulations and an excellent agrement between the two is observed. Moreover, we note that ``ridge smootenhing'' is often of limited effect already for over-parametrization ratios above $5$ and of virtually no effect for those above $10$. This solidifies the notion that one of the recently most popular neural networks paradigms -- \emph{zero-training (interpolating) generalizes well} -- enjoys wider applicability, including the one within the FRM estimation/prediction context.</description>

      <title>Bengining overfitting in Fixed Dimension via Physics-Informed Learning with Smooth Iductive Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning theory showed that interpolation to noisy samples using over-parameterized machine learning algorithms always leads to inconsistency. However, this work surprisingly discovers that interpolated machine learning can exhibit benign overfitting and consistency when using physics-informed learning for supervised tasks governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing laws of physics. An analysis provides an asymptotic Sobolev norm learning curve for kernel ridge(less) regression addressing linear inverse problems involving elliptic PDEs. The results reveal that the PDE operators can stabilize variance and lead to benign overfitting for fixed-dimensional problems, contrasting standard regression settings. The impact of various inductive biases introduced by minimizing different Sobolev norms as implicit regularization is also examined. Notably, the convergence rate is independent of the specific (smooth) inductive bias for both ridge and ridgeless regression. For regularized least squares estimators, all (smooth enough) inductive biases can achieve optimal convergence rates when the regularization parameter is properly chosen. The smoothness requirement recovers a condition previously found in the Bayesian setting and extends conclusions to minimum norm interpolation estimators.</description>

      <title>Precise analysis of ridge interpolators under heavy correlations -- a Random Duality Theory view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fully row/column-correlated linear regression models and study several classical estimators (including minimum norm interpolators (GLS), ordinary least squares (LS), and ridge regressors). We show that \emph{Random Duality Theory} (RDT) can be utilized to obtain precise closed form characterizations of all estimators related optimizing quantities of interest, including the \emph{prediction risk} (testing or generalization error). On a qualitative level out results recover the risk's well known non-monotonic (so-called double-descent) behavior as the number of features/sample size ratio increases. On a quantitative level, our closed form results show how the risk explicitly depends on all key model parameters, including the problem dimensions and covariance matrices. Moreover, a special case of our results, obtained when intra-sample (or time-series) correlations are not present, precisely match the corresponding ones obtained via spectral methods in [6,16,17,24].</description>

      <title>On Function-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes were introduced in the work "Function-Correcting Codes" by Lenz et al. 2023, which provides a graphical representation for the problem of constructing function-correcting codes. We use this graph to get a lower bound on the redundancy required for function correction. By considering the function to be a bijection, such an approach leads to a lower bound on the redundancy required for classical systematic error correcting codes of small distances. We identify a range of paramters for which the bound is tight. For single error correcting codes, we show that this bound is at least as good as a bound proposed by Zinoviev,
  Litsyn, and Laihonen in 1998. Thus, we propose the use of this framework to study systematic classical codes. Further, we study the structure of this graph for linear functions, which leads to bounds on the redundancy of linear-function correcting codes. We also show that for linear functions, a Plotkin-like bound proposed by Lenz et.al 2023 simplifies for linear functions. We present a version of the sphere packing bound for linear-function correcting codes. We identify a class of linear functions for which an upper bound proposed by Lenz et al., is tight. We also characterise a class of functions for which coset-wise coding is equivalent to a lower dimensional classical error correction problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encoding information in combinations of pre-synthesised deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strands (referred to as motifs) is an interesting approach to DNA storage that could potentially circumvent the prohibitive costs of nucleotide-by-nucleotide DNA synthesis. Based on our analysis of an empirical data set from HelixWorks, we propose two channel models for this setup (with and without interference) and analyse their fundamental limits. We propose a coding scheme that approaches those limits by leveraging all information available at the output of the channel, in contrast to earlier schemes developed for a similar setup by Preuss et al. We highlight an important connection between channel capacity curves and the fundamental trade-off between synthesis (writing) and sequencing (reading), and offer a way to mitigate an exponential growth in decoding complexity with the size of the motif library.</description>

      <title>Universality of Approximate Message Passing algorithms and tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms provide a valuable tool for studying mean-field approximations and dynamics in a variety of applications. Although these algorithms are often first derived for matrices having independent Gaussian entries or satisfying rotational invariance in law, their state evolution characterizations are expected to hold over larger universality classes of random matrix ensembles.
  We develop several new results on AMP universality. For AMP algorithms tailored to independent Gaussian entries, we show that their state evolutions hold over broadly defined generalized Wigner and white noise ensembles, including matrices with heavy-tailed entries and heterogeneous entrywise variances that may arise in data applications. For AMP algorithms tailored to rotational invariance in law, we show that their state evolutions hold over delocalized sign-and-permutation-invariant matrix ensembles that have a limit distribution over the diagonal, including sensing matrices composed of subsampled Hadamard or Fourier transforms and diagonal operators.
  We establish these results via a simplified moment-method proof, reducing AMP universality to the study of products of random matrices and diagonal tensors along a tensor network. As a by-product of our analyses, we show that the aforementioned matrix ensembles satisfy a notion of asymptotic freeness with respect to such tensor networks, which parallels usual definitions of freeness for traces of matrix products.</description>

      <title>A Novel Analytical Model for LEO and MEO Satellite Networks based on Cox Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03549v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work develops an analytical framework for downlink low Earth orbit (LEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite communications, leveraging tools from stochastic geometry. We propose a tractable approach to the analysis of such satellite communication systems, accounting for the fact that satellites are located on circular orbits. We accurately incorporate this geometric property of LEO or MEO satellite constellations by developing a Cox point process model that jointly produces orbits and satellites on these orbits. Our work contrasts with previous modeling studies that presumed satellite locations to be entirely random, thereby overlooking the fundamental fact that satellites are jointly positioned on orbits. Employing this Cox model, we analyze the network performance experienced by users located on Earth. Specifically, we evaluate the no-satellite probability of the proposed network and the Laplace transform of the interference created by such a network. Using it, we compute its SIR (signal-to-interference) distribution, namely its coverage probability. By presenting fundamental network performance as functions of key parameters, this model allows one to assess the statistical properties of downlink LEO or MEO satellite communications and can thus be used as a system-level design tool to operate and optimize forthcoming complex LEO or MEO satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Learning Without Labeled Multimodal Data: Guarantees and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many machine learning systems that jointly learn from multiple modalities, a core research question is to understand the nature of multimodal interactions: how modalities combine to provide new task-relevant information that was not present in either alone. We study this challenge of interaction quantification in a semi-supervised setting with only labeled unimodal data and naturally co-occurring multimodal data (e.g., unlabeled images and captions, video and corresponding audio) but when labeling them is time-consuming. Using a precise information-theoretic definition of interactions, our key contribution is the derivation of lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in this semi-supervised setting. We propose two lower bounds: one based on the shared information between modalities and the other based on disagreement between separately trained unimodal classifiers, and derive an upper bound through connections to approximate algorithms for min-entropy couplings. We validate these estimated bounds and show how they accurately track true interactions. Finally, we show how these theoretical results can be used to estimate multimodal model performance, guide data collection, and select appropriate multimodal models for various tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity Calibration of Dual-Antenna Repeaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a reciprocity calibration method for dual-antenna repeaters in wireless networks. The method uses bi-directional measurements between two network nodes, A and B, where for each bi-directional measurement, the repeaters are configured in different states. The nodes A and B could be two access points in a distributed MIMO system, or they could be a base station and a mobile user terminal, for example. From the calibration measurements, the differences between the repeaters' forward and reverse gains are estimated. The repeaters are then (re-)configured to compensate for these differences such that the repeaters appear, transparently to the network, as reciprocal components of the propagation environment, enabling reciprocity-based beamforming in the network.</description>

      <title>Association schemes arising from non-weakly regular bent functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Association schemes play an important role in algebraic combinatorics and have important applications in coding theory, graph theory and design theory. The methods to construct association schemes by using bent functions have been extensively studied. Recently, in [13], {\"O}zbudak and Pelen constructed infinite families of symmetric association schemes of classes $5$ and $6$ by using ternary non-weakly regular bent functions.They also stated that constructing $2p$-class association schemes from $p$-ary non-weakly regular bent functions is an interesting problem, where $p&gt;3$ is an odd prime. In this paper, using non-weakly regular bent functions, we construct infinite families of symmetric association schemes of classes $2p$, $(2p+1)$ and $\frac{3p+1}{2}$ for any odd prime $p$. Fusing those association schemes, we also obtain $t$-class symmetric association schemes, where $t=4,5,6,7$. In addition, we give the sufficient and necessary conditions for the partitions $P$, $D$, $T$, $U$ and $V$ (defined in this paper) to induce symmetric association schemes.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Holographic MIMO: Wavenumber-Domain Sparsity Inspired Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the sparse channel estimation for holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) systems. Given that the wavenumber-domain representation is based on a series of Fourier harmonics that are in essence a series of orthogonal basis functions, a novel wavenumber-domain sparsifying basis is designed to expose the sparsity inherent in HMIMO channels. Furthermore, by harnessing the beneficial sparsity in the wavenumber domain, the sparse estimation of HMIMO channels is structured as a compressed sensing problem, which can be efficiently solved by our proposed wavenumber-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (WD-OMP) algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed wavenumber-domain sparsifying basis maintains its detection accuracy regardless of the number of antenna elements and antenna spacing. Additionally, in the case of antenna spacing being much less than half a wavelength, the wavenumber-domain approach remains highly accurate in identifying the significant angular power of HMIMO channels.</description>
