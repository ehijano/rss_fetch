      <title>Enhancement of axial anomaly effects in hot two-color QCD: FRG approach in the linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal properties of hadrons in two-color quantum chromodynamics (QC$_2$D) using the functional renormalization group (FRG) method, with particular focus on modifications of the $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. The hadrons are described by a linear sigma model (LSM) based on the Pauli-G\"{u}rsey $SU(4)$ symmetry, which incorporates both low-lying $0^\pm$ mesons and diquark baryons. We find that all quartic couplings are comparably suppressed when physical values of the pion mass and decay constant are taken as inputs, for which a reasonably smooth chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature is reproduced. Consequently, mass differences among chiral partners remain small. Despite these tiny mass differences, mass degeneracies of chiral partners in the hot medium are clearly demonstrated, consistent with chiral symmetry restoration. Moreover, we find that the couplings responsible for the $U(1)$ axial anomaly are enhanced upon entering the finite temperature regime. Baryonic fluctuations also provide sizable contributions to these enhancements. Finally, the fate of the topological susceptibility in the hot QC$_2$D medium is examined.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of screening masses of mesons in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12675v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>

      <title>Localization in the Dirac spectrum and gauge-field topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study localization of the low Dirac modes in 3+1 dimensional pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory at zero and nonzero imaginary $\theta$ angle, with the aim of better characterizing the relation between low-mode localization and topological features of gauge theories. We show that the mobility edge observed in the deconfined phase at $\theta=0$ is present also at nonzero $\theta$, appearing exactly at the deconfinement transition. We find that the mobility edge is affected by topology only indirectly, through its effects on the ordering of the Polyakov loop. Moreover, the change in the mobility edge is strongly correlated with the change in the Polyakov-loop expectation value, both as one moves along the critical line, and as one departs from it toward higher temperatures. This further strengthens the connection between low-mode localization and deconfinement, showing in particular the key role played by the ordering of the Polyakov loop.</description>

      <title>Glueball mass spectrum at finite temperature revisited: Constant contribution in glueball correlators in the deconfinement phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the glueball properties at finite temperature from the temporal correlation in $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory using anisotropic lattice QCD. Although the existence of a constant contribution to the meson correlation function appearing in the deconfinement phase is known, its effect on the glueball correlation function at finite temperature has not been considered in previous studies. The present study reveals that the constant contribution to the glueball correlation function actually occurs in the three lowest-lying glueball states, corresponding to the $0^{++}$, $2^{++}$, and $0^{-+}$ glueballs, from near the critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition $T_C$ to the high temperature side. If the existence of constant terms is taken into account in the standard pole-mass analysis, it is observed that the pole-mass of the glueball ground state remains unchanged below $T_c$ and then increases with temperature above $T_C$. The result indicates that the true temperature dependence of the glueball mass above $T_C$ is opposite to the results of the previous studies.</description>

      <title>Toward hybrid quantum simulations with qubits and qumodes on trapped-ion platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of gate-based hybrid quantum computing using both discrete (qubit) and continuous (qumode) variables on trapped-ion platforms. Trapped-ion systems have demonstrated record one- and two-qubit gate fidelities and long qubit coherence times, while qumodes, which can be represented by the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain, have remained relatively unexplored for their use in computing. Using numerical simulations, we show that high-fidelity hybrid gates and measurement operations can be achieved for existing trapped-ion quantum platforms. As an exemplary application, we consider quantum simulations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, which is given by a one-dimensional chain of interacting spin and boson degrees of freedom. Using classical simulations, we study its real-time evolution and develop a suitable variational quantum algorithm for ground state preparation. Our results motivate further studies of hybrid quantum computing in this context, which may lead to direct applications in condensed matter and fundamental particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group equations of the LEFT at two loops: dimension-five effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions in the low-energy effective field theory (LEFT): the effects at dimension five in the power counting. Our calculation is performed in a basis with generic mass matrices, we employ the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, and we correct for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects by including the appropriate finite counterterms. We also provide results for the $CP$-even sector in a scheme that coincides with naive dimensional regularization. We discuss two methods to avoid the explicit construction of gauge-variant operators, which in principle are needed for the cancellation of sub-divergences, even in the background-field method. The two methods are consistent with each other and with existing partial results. Our work is a further step towards a complete EFT framework for physics beyond the Standard Model at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Baryon-Baryon Interaction in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the large-$N_c$ structure of the baryon-baryon potential derived in the framework of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order including contact interactions as well as one-meson and two-meson exchange diagrams. Moreover, we assess the impact of SU(3) symmetry breaking from a large-$N_c$ perspective and show that the leading order results can successfully be applied to the hyperon-nucleon potential. Our results include a reduction of the number of relevant low-energy constants of the leading order contact interaction from fifteen to three, and we show that consistency is preserved if the $F/D$ ratio is given by $2/3$ and the $C/D$ ratio for the baryon decuplet-to-octet coupling is given by 2.</description>

      <title>On the pole trajectory of the subthreshold negative parity nucleon with varying pion masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pole trajectory of the recently established subthreshold negative parity nucleon pole, namely the $N^*(920)$, with varying pion masses, in the scheme of linear $\sigma$ model with nucleons using the $N/D$ unitarization method. We find that as the pion mass increases, the pole moves toward the real axis. For larger pion masses, at tree level, the pole falls to a specific point on $u$-channel cut and crosses to the adjacent Riemann sheet defined by the logarithmic $u$ channel cut. At one-loop level, the pole does not meet the $u$-cut up to $m_\pi=0.36$GeV. We also re-examined the $\sigma$ pole trajectory and find it in good agreement with Roy equation analysis result.</description>

      <title>Quantum Determinant Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum algorithm for computing the determinant of a unitary matrix $U\in U(N)$ is given. The algorithm requires no preparation of eigenstates of $U$ and estimates the phase of the determinant to $t$ binary digits accuracy with $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2 N+t^2)$ operations and $tN$ controlled applications of $U^{2^m}$ with $m=0,\ldots,t-1$. For an orthogonal matrix $O\in O(N)$ the algorithm can determine with certainty the sign of the determinant using $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2 N)$ operations and $N$ controlled applications of $O$. An extension of the algorithm to contractions is discussed.</description>

      <title>$D \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \bar D^*(2400)$ molecular states: Probing their electromagnetic fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As in previous decades, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate internal configuration of hadrons continues to be a central objective within both experimental and theoretical hadron physics. This pursuit plays a pivotal role in advancing our knowledge of QCD and critically evaluating the robustness and accuracy of the theoretical models developed to date. Furthermore, deciphering the underlying mechanisms of exotic states, both those currently observed and those anticipated in future experiments, remains a pressing and unresolved challenge. Motivated by this, in the present study, we investigate the electromagnetic properties of the $D \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \bar D^*(2400)$ molecular tetraquark states with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{--}$, using the QCD light-cone sum rule method. These states are analyzed within a hadronic molecular framework, where their magnetic and quadrupole moments are computed to probe internal structure and geometric deformation. Our results reveal distinct electromagnetic signatures, with the magnetic moments primarily dominated by light-quark contributions, and the quadrupole moments suggesting an oblate charge distribution. The findings are compared with prior studies assuming compact tetraquark configurations, emphasizing the sensitivity of electromagnetic observables to the underlying hadronic structure. This analysis provides critical insights into the nature of exotic hadrons and contributes to the broader understanding of QCD dynamics in the non-perturbative regime.</description>
