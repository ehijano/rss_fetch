      <title>Toward Sustainable Rare Earth Element Production: Key Challenges in Techno-Economic, Life Cycle, and Social Impact Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth elements (REEs) are 17 critical minerals used in many clean energy technologies like wind turbines and electric vehicles. Conventionally, we produce REEs from mining in few, geopolitically restricted regions. Developing systems that utilize new technologies and unconventional feedstocks provides an opportunity to meet increasing demand while improving sustainability. Techno-economic analysis (TEA), life cycle assessment (LCA), and social LCA (sLCA) are commonly used tools to assess the sustainability performance of these systems. However, analyses of REE systems encounter challenges including system scope, data availability, technology scale-up, and uncertainty. In the reviewed literature, systems served multiple functions beyond producing REEs, including circularizing production and waste remediation, leading to discrepancies in scope. Further, the instability of REE prices led to high uncertainty due to different revenue, costs, functional unit, and impact allocation. Therefore, these analyses leave decision makers with an incomplete understanding of the current landscape of REE production inhibiting intelligent and efficient identification of future direction. In this narrative review, we conducted a comprehensive overview of the literature, synthesized studies from each pillar of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social), highlighted the challenges and limitations in each field, and recommended direction for future work developing sustainable REE production systems.</description>

      <title>Breadth, Depth, and Flux of Course-Prerequisite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Course-prerequisite networks (CPNs) are directed acyclic graphs that model complex academic curricula by representing courses as nodes and dependencies between them as directed links. These networks are indispensable tools for visualizing, studying, and understanding curricula. For example, CPNs can be used to detect important courses, improve advising, guide curriculum design, analyze graduation time distributions, and quantify the strength of knowledge flow between different university departments. However, most CPN analyses to date have focused only on micro- and meso-scale properties. To fill this gap, we define and study three new global CPN measures: breadth, depth, and flux. All three measures are invariant under transitive reduction and are based on the concept of topological stratification, which generalizes topological ordering in directed acyclic graphs. These measures can be used for macro-scale comparison of different CPNs. We illustrate the new measures numerically by applying them to three real and synthetic CPNs from three universities: the Cyprus University of Technology, the California Institute of Technology, and Johns Hopkins University. The CPN data analyzed in this paper are publicly available in a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Discussion Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make scientific truth more reliable and qualified, I propose to focus on the chain of discussion in a scientific journal rather than on each original paper. The value, quality and reliability should be judged by the form of the whole discussion chain, not only by an original report. Funding and sponsorship should also give more priority to the extension of the discussion chain. Maintaining the discussion chain and evaluating each scientific truth by the whole chain is the next value of the scientific community in the post-generative AI era.</description>

      <title>Sociophysics models inspired by the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ising model, originally developed for understanding magnetic phase transitions, has become a cornerstone in the study of collective phenomena across diverse disciplines. In this review, we explore how Ising and Ising-like models have been successfully adapted to sociophysical systems, where binary-state agents mimic human decisions or opinions. By focusing on key areas such as opinion dynamics, financial markets, social segregation, game theory, language evolution, and epidemic spreading, we demonstrate how the models describing these phenomena, inspired by the Ising model, capture essential features of collective behavior, including phase transitions, consensus formation, criticality, and metastability. In particular, we emphasize the role of the dynamical rules of evolution in the different models that often converge back to Ising-like universality. We end by outlining the future directions in sociphysics research, highlighting the continued relevance of the Ising model in the analysis of complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Advocacy for Physics and for Physicists: Results of an Informal Survey of American Physical Society Members in 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the wake of a rash of executive orders and administrative actions aimed at shaping the scale, scope, and focus of the scientific enterprise in the United States during the second Trump Presidency, we have undertaken a survey of members of the American Physical Society, the country's pre-eminent physics professional society to investigate their needs, interests, and priorities, and how their interests may differ from organizational leadership's priorities. This report provides detail on the context for the creation and implementation of the survey, as well as articulating results and some common themes found in responses. Broadly, our informal survey of APS members revealed that a majority of respondents perceive that the Society supports them, cares about their needs as physicists, and is communicating reliably and transparently. However, a sizeable proportion of respondents -- up to 30\% -- harbor concerns about the organization's actions, its prioritization of member needs over corporate interests, or its willingness to listen to members. In addition, a strong majority -- over two-thirds of respondents -- articulated a desire for more concrete and personal support from APS. While we acknowledge that the Society cannot be all things to all people, the results of our work lead us to the concern that there may indeed be a disconnect between the APS envisioned by those at the top of the organization and those who fill its ranks.</description>

      <title>Threshold behavior of a social norm in response to error proneness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A social norm defines what is good and what is bad in social contexts, as well as what to do based on such assessments. A stable social norm should be maintained against errors committed by its players. In addition, individuals may have different probabilities of errors in following the norm, and a social norm would be unstable if it benefited those who do not follow the norm carefully. In this work, we show that Simple Standing, which has been known to resist errors and mutants successfully, actually exhibits threshold behavior. That is, in a population of individuals playing the donation game according to Simple Standing, the residents can suppress the invasion of mutants with higher error proneness only if the residents' own error proneness is sufficiently low. Otherwise, the population will be invaded by mutants that commit assessment errors more frequently, and a series of such invasions will eventually undermine the existing social norm. This study suggests that the stability analysis of a social norm may have a different picture if the probability of error itself is regarded as an individual attribute.</description>

      <title>Beyond Distance: Mobility Neural Embeddings Reveal Visible and Invisible Barriers in Urban Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mobility in cities is shaped not only by visible structures such as highways, rivers, and parks but also by invisible barriers rooted in socioeconomic segregation, uneven access to amenities, and administrative divisions. Yet identifying and quantifying these barriers at scale and their relative importance on people's movements remains a major challenge. Neural embedding models, originally developed for language, offer a powerful way to capture the complexity of human mobility from large-scale data. Here, we apply this approach to 25.4 million observed trajectories across 11 major U.S. cities, learning mobility embeddings that reveal how people move through urban space. These mobility embeddings define a functional distance between places, one that reflects behavioral rather than physical proximity, and allow us to detect barriers between neighborhoods that are geographically close but behaviorally disconnected. We find that the strongest predictors of these barriers are differences in access to amenities, administrative borders, and residential segregation by income and race. These invisible borders are concentrated in urban cores and persist across cities, spatial scales, and time periods. Physical infrastructure, such as highways and parks, plays a secondary but still significant role, especially at short distances. We also find that individuals who cross barriers tend to do so outside of traditional commuting hours and are more likely to live in areas with greater racial diversity, and higher transit use or income. Together, these findings reveal how spatial, social, and behavioral forces structure urban accessibility and provide a scalable framework to detect and monitor barriers in cities, with applications in planning, policy evaluation, and equity analysis.</description>

      <title>A New World Framework: The Three Realms and Six Layers Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework for understanding the world, termed the "Three Realms and Six Layers Model". Based on the concept of scale, the world is divided into three realms, each encompassing six layers, with a ten-thousand-fold difference in scale between adjacent layers. This unique division reveals the variations in laws at different levels and the fundamental changes in laws when transitioning between realms. The model offers a new perspective for addressing interdisciplinary issues, especially in understanding the behavior of large-scale systems and their connection to microscopic phenomena. In summary, the "Three Realms and Six Layers Model" provides a novel tool for comprehending the diversity and complexity of the universe.</description>

      <title>Bounded confidence dynamics generates opinion cascades on growing scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the pairwise bounded confidence model on scale-free networks where new agents regularly arrive over time. The probability that arriving agents form links to preexisting ones depends on both agent degree and opinion proximity. In parameter value ranges where both factors impact the link choice, a new phenomenon is observed. Minor clusters continuously form on the periphery of the opinion space and remain stable for a time, before suddenly merging with a major cluster in the network. We label these processes as "opinion cascades", and analyse their origin and behavior. They are triggered by the arrival of agents acting as "bridges" between the previously disconnected minor and major clusters. Lastly, we propose theoretical approximations to describe the varying shapes and merging behavior of opinion cascades under different conditions.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Influence of Pavement Performance on Road Safety Through Crash Frequency and Severity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Road safety is impacted by a range of factors that can be categorized into human, vehicle, and roadway/environmental elements. This research explores the connection between pavement performance and road safety, particularly in relation to crash frequency and severity, using data from the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) for 2022. By merging crash data with pavement inventory data, we conduct a spatial analysis that incorporates the geographical coordinates of crash sites with the conditions of road segments. Statistical methods are applied to compare crash rates and severity across various pavement condition categories. To identify the most influential factors affecting crash rates and severity, we use machine learning models along with negative binomial and ordered probit regression models. The study's key findings reveal that higher speed limits, well-maintained roads, and improved friction scores correlate with lower crash rates, whereas rougher roads and adverse weather conditions are linked to higher crash severity. This analysis emphasizes the critical need for prioritizing pavement maintenance and integrating safety-focused design principles to boost road safety. Moreover, the study underscores the ongoing need for research to better understand and address the intricate relationship between pavement performance and road safety.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou High-Dimensional Trajectories Through Manifold Learning: A Linear Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</description>

      <title>Voter model can accurately predict individual opinions in online populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of opinion dynamics describe how opinions are shaped in various environments. While these models are able to replicate general opinion distributions observed in real-world scenarios, their capacity to align with data at the user level remains mostly untested. We evaluate the capacity of the multi-state voter model with zealots to capture individual opinions in a fine-grained Twitter dataset collected during the 2017 French Presidential elections. Our findings reveal a strong correspondence between individual opinion distributions in the equilibrium state of the model and ground-truth political leanings of the users. Additionally, we demonstrate that discord probabilities accurately identify pairs of like-minded users. These results emphasize the validity of the voter model in complex settings, and advocate for further empirical evaluations of opinion dynamics models at the user level.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.</description>
