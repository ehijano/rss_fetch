      <title>Magnetotransport in a graphite cylinder under quantizing fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the transport properties of curved, three-dimensional graphite samples in strong magnetic fields. Focusing on a millimeter-scale graphite cylinder as a prototypical curved object, we perform longitudinal and Hall voltage measurements while applying quantizing magnetic fields. These measurements are investigated as a function of field strength and angles. Most importantly, we find that angle-dependent Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations are superimposed with angle-independent features. Reproducing the experimental observations, we introduce a network model that accounts for the cylindrical geometry effect by conceptualizing the cylinder as composed of strips of planar graphite in an effectively inhomogeneous magnetic field. Our work highlights how the interplay between geometric curvature and quantizing magnetic fields can be leveraged to engineer tunable spatial current densities within solid-state systems, and paves the way for understanding transport properties of curved and bent three-dimensional samples more generally.</description>

      <title>Photon Generation in Double Superconducting Cavities: Quantum Circuits Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we studied photon generation due to the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) in a one dimensional (1+1) double superconducting cavity. The cavity consists of two perfectly conducting mirrors and a dielectric membrane of infinitesimal depth that effectively couples two cavities. The total length of the double cavity $L$, the difference in length between the two cavities $\Delta L$, and the electric susceptibility $\chi$ and conductivity $v$ of the dielectric membrane are tunable parameters. All four parameters are treated as independent and are allowed to be tuned at the same time, even with different frequencies. We analyzed the cavity's energy spectra under different conditions, finding a transition between two distinct regimes that is accurately described by $k_c=\sqrt{v/\chi}$. In particular, a lowest energy mode is forbidden in one of the regimes while it is allowed in the other. We compared analytical approximations obtained through the Multiple Scale Analysis method with exact numeric solutions, obtaining the typical results when $\chi$ is not being tuned. However, when the susceptibility $\chi$ is tuned, different behaviours (such as oscillations in the number of photons of a cavity prepared in a vacuum state) might arise if the frequencies and amplitudes of all parameters are adequate. These oscillations can be considered as adiabatic shortcuts where all generated photons are eventually destroyed. Finally, we present an equivalent quantum circuit that would allow to experimentally simulate the DCE under the studied conditions.</description>

      <title>Observation of Klein bottle quadrupole topological insulators in electric circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Klein bottle Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) insulator phase plays a pivotal role in understanding higher-order topological phases. The insulator phase is characterized by a unique feature: a nonsymmorphic glide symmetry that exists within momentum space, rather than real space. This characteristic transforms the Brillouin zone's fundamental domain into a structure of Klein bottle. Here, we report an observation of a Klein bottle topoelectrical model under gauge fields. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the different corner distributions of odd and even unit cells, we present theoretical calculations and demonstrate that the symmetry properties significantly affect the topological nature. These theoretical predictions are confirmed by experimental results, which demonstrate the practical feasibility of such topological configurations in electronic circuits. Our work establishes a vital connection between the realms of condensed matter physics and circuit systems, thereby paving a pathway for investigating exotic condensed matter physics.</description>
