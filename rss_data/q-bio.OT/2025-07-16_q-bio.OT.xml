      <title>Analysis of Biomedical Data to Assess the Risk of Heart Rate Variability in Athletes Participating in Long-Term Excessive Endurance Exercise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amateur marathon runners who exercise excessively over time have pathological structural changes in their hearts and aortas. Amateur marathon runners' cardiovascular system adaptations and dangers are discussed in this article. After completing endurance races, amateur athletes experience a series of cardiac modifications, including temporary elevation and changes in biomarkers of cardiac damage associated with an increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. As a result of the high prevalence of "false positive" biomarkers in athletes, the health benefits of aerobic activity are questioned, and treatment is complicated. Reports on long-term aerobic exercise contradict atherosclerosis risk. Differences may influence the results in lifestyle characteristics among participants. By comparing runners with their non-runner wives, we find that regular, high intensity run training improves many components of the cardiovascular profile but does not reduce atherosclerosis. Although metabolomic approaches have been developed to evaluate the physiological response of marathon runners, there is still controversy concerning the biomarkers of cardiovascular system alterations caused by long-term high-intensity endurance training. The cardiovascular risk profile is improved by habitual endurance exercise. Atherosclerosis is caused by age and cardiovascular risks; however, is little affected by it.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable AI framework Quantifying Traditional Chinese Medicine Principles Towards Enhancing and Integrating with Modern Biomedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis and treatment principles, established through centuries of trial-and-error clinical practice, directly maps patient-specific symptom patterns to personalised herbal therapies. These empirical holistic mapping principles offer valuable strategies to address remaining challenges of reductionism methodologies in modern biomedicine. However, the lack of a quantitative framework and molecular-level evidence has limited their interpretability and reliability. Here, we present an AI framework trained on ancient and classical TCM formula records to quantify the symptom pattern-herbal therapy mappings. Interestingly, we find that empirical TCM diagnosis and treatment are consistent with the encoding-decoding processes in the AI model. This enables us to construct an interpretable TCM embedding space (TCM-ES) using the model's quantitative representation of TCM principles. Validated through broad and extensive TCM patient data, the TCM-ES offers universal quantification of the TCM practice and therapeutic efficacy. We further map biomedical entities into the TCM-ES through correspondence alignment. We find that the principal directions of the TCM-ES are significantly associated with key biological functions (such as metabolism, immune, and homeostasis), and that the disease and herb embedding proximity aligns with their genetic relationships in the human protein interactome, which demonstrate the biological significance of TCM principles. Moreover, the TCM-ES uncovers latent disease relationships, and provides alternative metric to assess clinical efficacy for modern disease-drug pairs. Finally, we construct a comprehensive and integrative TCM knowledge graph, which predicts potential associations between diseases and targets, drugs, herbal compounds, and herbal therapies, providing TCM-informed opportunities for disease analysis and drug development.</description>
