      <title>JADES and BlackTHUNDER: rest-frame Balmer-line absorption and the local environment in a Little Red Dot at z = 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 5.077, observed with both NIRSpec/MSA and NIRSpec/IFU by the JADES and BlackTHUNDER surveys. The target exhibits all the hallmark features of a 'Little Red Dot' (LRD) AGN. The combination of spatially resolved and high-resolution spectroscopy offers deeper insight into its nature. The H$\alpha$ line has multiple components, including two broad Gaussians, yielding a black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) = 7.65$, while the narrow [O III]$\lambda$5007 gives a galaxy dynamical mass of $\log(M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot) = 9.1$, suggesting a dynamically overmassive black hole relative to the host galaxy. The target has two satellites, and is immersed in a 7-kpc wide pool of ionized gas. A spatially detached outflow is also tentatively detected. H$\alpha$ shows strong absorption with high equivalent width (EW), ruling out a stellar origin, and with velocity and velocity dispersion of v = -13 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma$ = 120 km s$^{-1}$. There is tentative evidence (2.6 $\sigma$) of temporal variability in the EW of the H$\alpha$ absorber over two rest-frame months. If confirmed, this would suggest a highly dynamic environment. Notably, while the H$\alpha$ absorber is clearly visible and even dominant in the high-resolution G395H observations, it is not detected in the medium-resolution G395M data of the same epoch. This implies that the current incidence rate of absorbers in LRDs - and especially of rest-frame absorbers - may be severely underestimated, because most LRDs rely on lower-resolution spectroscopy. In this context, the high incidence rate of rest-frame absorbers in LRDs may indicate a configuration that is either intrinsically stationary, such as a rotating disc, or that exhibits time-averaged stability, such as an oscillatory 'breathing mode' accretion of cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas around the SMBH.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the nanoHz gravitational wave sky: frequency-correlated anisotropy induced by eccentric supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing the nature of the nanoHz gravitational wave (GW) signal recently reported by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) collaborations around the world is the next goal of low-frequency GW astronomy. The signal likely originates from the incoherent superposition of GWs emitted by a cosmological population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Those binaries can be highly eccentric and/or strongly coupled to their nuclear environment, resulting in an attenuation of the overall GW signal at low frequencies. In this paper, we propose to use the correlation properties of the distributed GW power in the sky across the frequency spectrum as a smoking gun for eccentric SMBHBs thus allowing to break the spectral degeneracy between eccentricity and environmental effect. The simple underlying idea is that, contrary to circular binaries, eccentric ones emit a broadband spectrum thus resulting in similar sky maps at different frequencies. We first demonstrate the applicability of this simple concept on sky maps constructed directly from the theoretical sky distribution of the GWB power induced by realistic populations of SMBHBs. We then demonstrate the viability of this analysis on simulated SKA-like PTA data. By statistically comparing sky maps reconstructed from hundreds injected circular and highly eccentric SMBHB populations, we find that eccentricity can be detected at $3\sigma$ in more than $50\%$ of cases.</description>

      <title>Truncations in the X-ray Halos of Early-Type Galaxies as a Tracer of Feedback and Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of X-ray halos in early-type galaxies depends on key structure assembly processes such as feedback and mergers. However, the signatures of these processes are difficult to characterize due to their faint and amorphous nature. We demonstrate that the truncation in the temperature profile of X-ray halos, defined by the radial location of the peak temperature, is significantly more impacted by recent mergers or galaxy interactions than feedback processes. At a fixed stellar mass, a highly asymmetric X-ray halo can be nearly a factor of ten more truncated than a relaxed one. This analysis led to a discovery of previously unknown asymmetric features in the optical and X-ray halos of three massive galaxies. We detect the intra-group star light and a large ~45 kpc size stellar stream connected to NGC 0383, suggesting that a recent stellar accretion event has triggered its active galactic nuclei to emit a powerful radio jet. While the disturbed X-ray halo of NGC 1600 is also related to a galaxy-satellite tidal interaction detected in optical imaging, the X-ray shape and asymmetry of NGC 4555 is highly unusual for a galaxy in a low dense environment, requiring further investigation. These results highlight the importance of truncations and deep imaging techniques for untangling the formation of X-ray halos in massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Overmassive Black holes live in compact galaxies in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant population of quasars have been found to exist within the first Gyr of cosmic time. Most of them have high black hole (BH) masses ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8-10} M_{\odot}$) with an elevated BH-to-stellar mass ratio compared to typical local galaxies, posing challenges to our understanding of the formation of supermassive BHs and their coevolution with host galaxies. Here, based on size measurements of [CII] 158$\mu$m emission for a statistical sample of $z \sim 6$ quasars, we find that their host galaxies are systematically more compact (with half-light radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 1.6$ kpc) than typical star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. Specifically, the sizes of the most compact quasar hosts, which also tend to contain less cold gas than their more extended counterparts, are comparable to that of massive quiescent galaxies at $z \sim 4-5$. These findings reveal an intimate connection between the formation of massive BHs and compactness of their host galaxies in the early universe. These compact quasar hosts are promising progenitors of the first population of quiescent galaxies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in the Pillars of Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to dust grain alignment with magnetic fields, dust polarization observations of far-infrared emission from cold molecular clouds are often used to trace magnetic fields, allowing a probe of the effects of magnetic fields on the star formation process. We present inferred magnetic field maps of the Pillars of Creation region within the larger M16 emission nebula, derived from dust polarization data in the 89 and 154 micron continuum using SOFIA/HAWC+. We derive magnetic field strength estimates using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. We compare the polarization and magnetic field strengths to column densities and dust continuum intensities across the region to build a coherent picture of the relationship between star forming activity and magnetic fields in the region. The projected magnetic field strengths derived are in the range of 50-130 microGauss, which is typical for clouds of similar n(H2), i.e., molecular hydrogen volume density on the order of 10^4-10^5 cm^(-3). We conclude that star formation occurs in the finger tips when the magnetic fields are too weak to prevent radial collapse due to gravity but strong enough to oppose OB stellar radiation pressure, while in the base of the fingers the magnetic fields hinder mass accretion and consequently star formation. We also support an initial weak field model (&lt;50 microGauss) with subsequent strengthening through realignment and compression, resulting in a dynamically important magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The MUSE view of the Sculptor galaxy: survey overview and the planetary nebulae luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 253, the Sculptor galaxy, is the southern, massive, star-forming disk galaxy closest to the Milky Way. In this work, we present a new 103-pointing MUSE mosaic of this galaxy covering the majority of its star-forming disk up to 0.75xR25. With an area of ~20x5 arcmin2 (~20x5 kpc2, projected) and a physical resolution of ~15 pc, this mosaic constitutes one of the largest, highest physical resolution integral field spectroscopy surveys of any star-forming galaxy to date. Here, we exploit the mosaic to identify a sample of ~500 planetary nebulae (~20 times larger than in previous studies) to build the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) and obtain a new estimate of the distance to NGC 253. The value obtained is 17% higher than estimates returned by other reliable measurements, mainly obtained via the top of the red giant branch method (TRGB). The PNLF also varies between the centre (r &lt; 4 kpc) and the disk of the galaxy. The distance derived from the PNLF of the outer disk is comparable to that of the full sample, while the PNLF of the centre returns a distance ~0.9 Mpc larger. Our analysis suggests that extinction related to the dust-rich interstellar medium and edge-on view of the galaxy (the average E(B-V) across the disk is ~0.35 mag) plays a major role in explaining both the larger distance recovered from the full PNLF and the difference between the PNLFs in the centre and in the disk.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Excitation Mechanisms in the LINER I Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 5005: Positive Feedback and a Thin LINER Cocoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatially resolved Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich analysis of the narrow-line region (NLR) in the low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) I galaxy NGC 5005 using Hubble Space Telescope narrowband imaging of [O III]${\lambda}$5007, H${\beta}$, H${\alpha}$, and [S II]${\lambda}{\lambda}$6717,6731. With a resolution of ${\lesssim}$0.1 (${\lesssim}$10 pc at z = 0.003), we dissect the NLR into H II (star-forming), Seyfert, and LINERs across spatial scales extending up to r$\sim$8 kpc from the nucleus. Our results reveal a compact nuclear region exhibiting Seyfert-like emission, consistent with photoionization by a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Surrounding this Seyfert-like nucleus is a thin ($\sim$20 pc thick) higher-excitation LINER-like cocoon, likely arising from shock-excited gas in the interstellar medium (ISM). Beyond this cocoon, a centrally localized extended (r$\sim$1 kpc) LINER-like region surrounds the Seyfert-like nucleus and cocoon, likely ionized by the AGN, while a more extended (r${\gtrsim}$2 kpc) LINER-like zone may be ionized by a combination of post-AGB stars and shocks from gas inflows. We also detect H II-like regions at both small and large scales. In the inner 500 pc, these regions may be triggered by jet-ISM interactions, potentially inducing localized star formation. At r$\sim$4 kpc, we identify an outer H II-like region tracing a large-scale star-forming ring, where ionization is dominated by young stars.</description>

      <title>Galactic seismology: can the Gaia 'phase spiral' co-exist with a clumpy, turbulent interstellar medium?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia satellite revealed a remarkable spiral pattern ('phase spiral', PS) in the z-Vz phase plane throughout the solar neighbourhood, where z and Vz are the displacement and velocity of a star perpendicular to the Galactic plane. As demonstrated by many groups, the kinematic signature reflects the Galactic stellar disc's response to a dynamical disturbance in the recent past (~0.3-3 Gyr). However, previous controlled simulations did not consider the impact of the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) on the existence of the PS. This is crucial because it has been suggested that this weak signal is highly susceptible to scattering by small-scale density fluctuations typical of the ISM. This has motivated us to explore the formation and fate of the PS in a high-resolution, N-body/hydrodynamical simulation of an idealised Galaxy analogue bearing a realistic ISM, which interacts impulsively with a massive perturber. In our models, high gas surface densities within the disc encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas via feedback to drive turbulence. We find that the PS is almost non-existent if the ISM has an excess of power on sub-kiloparsec scales compared to longer wavelengths. This can happen in the absence of star formation and feedback when the gas is allowed to cool. In the presence of turbulent gas maintained by stellar feedback, the PS has a patchy spatial distribution and a high degree of intermittency on kiloparsec scales. We anticipate that future studies of the phase-spiral behaviour on all scales will provide crucial information on star-gas dynamics.</description>

      <title>EMUSE: Evolutionary Map of the Universe Search Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present EMUSE (Evolutionary Map of the Universe Search Engine), a tool designed for searching specific radio sources within the extensive datasets of the EMU (Evolutionary Map of the Universe) survey, with potential applications to other Big Data challenges in astronomy. Built on a multimodal approach to radio source classification and retrieval, EMUSE fine-tunes the OpenCLIP model on curated radio galaxy datasets. Leveraging the power of foundation models, our work integrates visual and textual embeddings to enable efficient and flexible searches within large radio astronomical datasets. We fine-tune OpenCLIP using a dataset of 2,900 radio galaxies, encompassing various morphological classes, including FR-I, FR-II, FR-x, R-type, and other rare and peculiar sources. The model is optimized using adapter-based fine-tuning, ensuring computational efficiency while capturing the unique characteristics of radio sources. The fine-tuned model is then deployed in EMUSE, allowing for seamless image- and text-based queries over the EMU survey dataset. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in retrieving and classifying radio sources, particularly in recognizing distinct morphological features. However, challenges remain in identifying rare or previously unseen radio sources, highlighting the need for expanded datasets and continuous refinement. This study showcases the potential of multimodal machine learning in radio astronomy, paving the way for more scalable and accurate search tools in the field. The search engine is accessible at https://askap-emuse.streamlit.app/ and can be used locally by cloning the repository at https://github.com/Nikhel1/EMUSE.</description>

      <title>ALMASOP. A Rotating Feature Rich in Complex Organic Molecules in a Protostellar Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) in solar-like young stellar objects (YSOs), particularly within protostellar disks, are of significant interest due to their potential connection to prebiotic chemistry in emerging planetary systems. We report the discovery of a rotating feature enriched in COMs, including CH3OH, CH3CHO, and NH2CHO, in the protostellar core G192.12-11.10. By constructing a YSO model, we find that the COM-rich feature is likely located within or near the boundary of the Keplerian disk. The image synthesis results suggest that additional heating mechanisms leading to a warm ring or a warm inner disk are required to reproduce the observed emission. We discuss possible origins of the COM-rich feature, particularly accretion shocks as a plausible cause for a warm ring. Additionally, molecules such as C18O, H2CO, DCS, H2S, and OCS exhibit distinct behavior compared to CH3OH, indicating a range of physical and chemical conditions within the region. The observed kinematics of H2S and OCS suggest that OCS resides in regions closer to the central protostar than H2S, consistent with previous experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength study of observed and predicted pulsation properties of First overtone Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the light curves and pulsation properties of First Overtone (FO) Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) obtained using observations and predictions from stellar pulsation models. Multiwavelength observational light curves were compiled from the literature (OGLE-IV, Gaia and VMC). We investigate the period-amplitude (PA), period-colour (PC), period-luminosity (PL), and amplitude-colour (AC) relations for FO Cepheids at multiwavelengths. We find that the PA distribution of FO Cepheids in the MCs modelled using a Gaussian Mixture Model shows that the SMC consists of higher amplitude stars than the LMC. We find multiple break-points in the PC/PL/AC relations for FO/FU Cepheids in the optical and near-infrared bands including the one near to P = 2.5 d in the MCs using piecewise regression analysis and F- test statistics. Similarly, for the LMC FO Cepheids, we find a break-point in the PC/PL/AC relations near P = 0.58 d. The slopes of the PC relations for LMC FO Cepheids are found to be shallow for 0.58 &lt; P(d) &lt; 2.5 but steeper for P &lt; 0.58 d and P &gt; 2.5 d. We complemented the observed relations using theoretical models for FO Cepheids with chemical compositions Z = 0.008 and Z = 0.004, appropriate for the LMC and SMC, respectively computed with MESA-RSP. Our results show that the pulsation properties of FO Cepheids in PC/PL/AC relations and colour-magnitude diagram are strongly correlated and their connections can provide stringent constraints for the theoretical pulsation models.</description>

      <title>Limits to star formation in post starburst galaxies from Type II supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish significant upper limits to the current star formation rate in two samples of post starburst galaxies by measuring the rate of Type II supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Factory Bright Transient Survey. No Type II supernovae are observed within the Petrosian radii of $z &lt; 0.05$ post starburst galaxies during this supernova search survey. We calculate that at 95\% confidence level the star formation rate in these galaxies is $&lt; 0.8$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>AVID: Formation and evolution of a coalesced major merger of late-type dwarf galaxies (VCC 479) on the outskirts of the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf-dwarf galaxy mergers are among the least explored aspects of dwarf galaxy pre-processing as they fall into clusters. We present the first case study of a coalesced late-type dwarf major merger (VCC 479; stellar mass $\sim\,8\,\times\,10^7\,\rm M_\odot$) that has undergone significant environmental influence, with the aim of exploring dwarf galaxy evolution under the combined effects of galaxy interactions and environmental processes, and understanding its relevance to the diversity of dwarf galaxies in cluster environments. Our analysis is based on VLA and FAST HI emission line mapping from the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) survey. We also perform idealized hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf-dwarf mergers to help interpret the observations. We identify symmetric stellar shell structures in VCC 479, indicative of a coalesced major merger of dwarf galaxies. The galaxy features a central starburst, initiated $\sim$600 Myr ago, embedded within an exponential disk quenched $\sim$1 Gyr ago. The starburst contributes only 2.9$\pm$0.5\% of the total stellar mass, and VCC 479's global star formation rate is 0.3 dex lower than typical dwarfs of similar mass. The galaxy is highly HI deficient, with most HI gas concentrated within the central 1 kpc and little extended HI envelope. The misalignment of the HI velocity field with the stellar body is best explained by merger-triggered gas inflow, as seen in our simulations. Our analysis is consistent with a scenario that the majority of HI gas of the progenitor galaxies was removed by the cluster environment prior to the final coalescence. The merger concentrates the remaining gas toward the galaxy center, triggering a central starburst. The combined effect of environment stripping and galaxy merger has transformed VCC 479 into a blue-core dwarf undergoing morphological transition from a late-type to an early-type galaxy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational influence of the globular cluster NGC 7078 (M 15) flyby of the Oort cloud system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. It is crucial to understand the interaction between globular clusters (GCs) and the Oort cloud, as close flybys of such massive objects can significantly disturb the cloud's structure and redirect comets towards the inner Solar System. This increases the risk of impacts on Earth. Studying such events can teach us about the evolution and stability of the Solar System, as well as the effect of external gravitational forces on its dynamics over time. Aims. In our study of the gravitational effects of the flyby of the NGC 7078 or M 15 GC on the Oort cloud, we focus on two types of approximation. First, we investigate the impact on the Sun's orbit during close passages, treating the GC as a point mass. At the second stage, we use a complete N-body system representation of the GC comprising over one million particles. Methods. We carried out a dynamical study of the gravitational interaction between Oort cloud particles and galactic GCs within the time-varying galactic external potential. Initially, the GCs are represented as point masses orbiting the Galaxy alongside the Sun and the Oort cloud system. Results. Our study reveals significant variations in the impact of NGC 7078 on the Oort cloud, depending on whether it is modelled as a point mass or a complete N-body system. The N-body system results in much greater stripping of Oort cloud particles, with over 52% stripped during a close pass, compared to a few percent in the point mass model for a flyby at a large distance (&gt;200 pc) and 36% for a closer 10 pc point mass flyby. The N-body system also causes substantial expansion, with particles spreading over 50 pc from the Sun within 30 Myr after the GC's crossing. This creates a twisted and flattened cloud structure with extended outer tails. These stripped cloud particles (more than 10%) spread across the galaxy, reaching distances of up to 16 kpc from the Sun.</description>

      <title>MICONIC: JWST/MIRI MRS reveals a fast ionized gas outflow in the central region of Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a kinematical study of the ionized and molecular gas in the central region (~7-14"~100-200pc) of the nearby radio galaxy Cen A. We used JWST/MIRI MRS 5-28$\mu$m observations taken as part of the MIR Characterization of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) of the MIRI EC. The two gas phases present contrasting morphologies and kinematics. The brightest emission from the ionized gas, traced with a range of IP lines ([Fe II] to [Ne VI]), is extended along the direction of the radio jet. We also detected emission from low IP emission lines and H$_2$ transitions in the galaxy disk. Both gas phases present rotational motions but also complex kinematics. The observations reveal several ionized gas kinematical features that are consistent with simulation predictions of a jet-driven bubble and outflow interacting with the galaxy ISM. These include broad components in the nuclear line profiles ($\sigma$~600km/s), high velocities (~ +1000, -1400km/s) confined within the nuclear region, velocities of hundreds of km/s in several directions in the central 2", and enhanced velocity dispersions perpendicular to the radio jet. Moreover, we find evidence of shock excitation in the nuclear region based on MIR line ratios. We compared the ionized gas mass outflow rate with Cen A's AGN luminosity and radio jet power and demonstrate that both mechanisms provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow. The noncircular motions observed in the H$_2$ lines can be reproduced with either a warped rotating disk model or a radial component. The latter might be to related to gas streamers detected in cold molecular gas. There is no clear indication of a fast nuclear H$_2$ outflow, only a weak blueshifted component. This could be due to a relatively low nuclear warm H$_2$ column density and/or the limited geometrical coupling of Cen A's inner radio jet with the circumnuclear disk of the galaxy.

      <title>Overdense fireworks in GOODS-N: Unveiling a record number of massive dusty star forming galaxies at z$\sim$5.2 with the N2CLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the N2CLS Survey, we have identified a remarkable overdensity of ten bright dusty star-forming galaxies at z$\sim$5.2 in the GOODS-N field. Three of these galaxies, N2GN_1_01, 06, and 23 (known as GN10, HDF850.1, and S3, respectively), had previously been spectroscopically confirmed as members of the exceptional large-scale structure at z$\sim$5.1-5.3, which is notably elongated along the line of sight, spanning 30 cMpc. We present the spectroscopic confirmation of N2GN_1_13 at z$_{\rm spec}$=5.182, a massive dusty star-forming galaxy identified through targeted NOEMA observations, and N2GN_1_61 at z$_{\rm spec}$=5.201, revealed using JWST/FRESCO data. In addition to these five spectroscopically confirmed members, we identify five further candidates with photometric redshifts consistent with the overdense structure. These galaxies are massive (with a median stellar mass of 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$) and highly obscured (with a median A$_V$ of 2.9), caught in a short-lived yet extreme starburst phase at z$\sim$5.2. Their high SFRs (with a median of 680 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), efficient baryon to stellar mass conversion ($\epsilon_{\star}&gt;$20%), substantial gas reservoir and dust content, suggest rapid evolution and imminent quenching. Six of these galaxies reside in overdense filaments, while the remaining four may trace new distinct structures which will have to be spectroscopically confirmed. These few dusty galaxies dominate the star formation within the overdensity, contributing more than the numerous H$_{\alpha}$ emitters, and surpassing the cosmic average star formation rate density for this epoch. Their properties suggest an accelerated evolution that current models and simulations have difficulty reproducing.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Ice Inventory of NGC 1333 IRAS 2A with INDRA using JWST Observations: Tracing Organic Refractories and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of JWST, with its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral resolution, infrared spectral surveys have revealed a rich inventory of ices, including complex organic molecules (COMs), in young stellar objects (YSOs). However, robust methods to decompose and quantify these absorption features particularly across broad spectral ranges, are still under investigation. We present INDRA (Ice-fitting with NNLS-based Decomposition and Retrieval Algorithm), a fully Python-based tool that performs continuum and silicate removal, global ice fitting using Weighted Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS), and estimates column densities and statistical significance. We apply INDRA to NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, a target from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program previously studied using local fitting. We derive optical depths via polynomial continuum subtraction and remove silicate absorption using a synthetic model, isolating ice features for global MIRI fitting. Our results are consistent with previous local fits, confirming simple species and COMs, and expand the inventory by identifying additional absorption features from CO2 and NH4+. We also propose the presence of organic refractories contributing up to 9.6% in the spectral region of 5-8 microns among the various ice components, whose inclusion significantly improves the global spectral fitting. These broad absorption features, extending across 5.5-11 microns, are likely produced by large, complex molecules containing carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (O-H), amine (N-H), and C-H bending modes. Our expanded inventory, now incorporating these organic residues, offers new insights into the chemical evolution of ices in star-forming regions and highlights the importance of global spectral fitting in constraining ice compositions.</description>

      <title>Distances of Supernova Remnants Associated with Neutron Stars in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate distance measurements to supernova remnants (SNRs) are essential for determining their physical parameters, such as size, age, explosion energy, and for constraining the properties of associated neutron stars (NSs). We present an extinction--distance method that combines precise Gaia DR3 photometry, parallax, and stellar parameters from the SHBoost catalog to homogeneously construct extinction--distance profiles for 44 NS-associated Galactic SNRs. Applying a statistical model, we identify clear extinction jumps along each sightline, corresponding to probable SNR distances. We classify the results into three reliability levels (A, B, and C), primarily based on comparisons with previously reported kinematic distances, supplemented by independent estimates from other methods. Our results show that the majority of reliable distances (17 Level A and 8 Level B) are located within 5 kpc, predominantly in the Local Arm. This study presents an independent and effective method for determining distances to SNRs, particularly for those with small angular sizes or located in the second and third Galactic quadrants. Although the current method is limited to within 5 kpc due to the precision constraints of Gaia parallax and photometry, the upcoming Gaia DR4 release, combined with complementary infrared data, will extend its applicability to more distant and heavily obscured SNRs, and help resolve kinematic distance ambiguities.</description>

      <title>Impeding Turbulence Decay in Self-gravitating Cloud Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence governs the fragmentation of molecular clouds and plays a pivotal role in star formation. The persistence of observed cloud turbulence suggests it does not decay significantly within the turnover timescale, implying a recurrent driving mechanism. Although ubiquitous self-gravity is a plausible driver, MHD simulations by \citet{ostriker2001density} demonstrated that self-gravity alone does not modify the global turbulence decay rate. In this study, we demonstrate that the dominant diffuse volume of a cloud dictates its overall decay rate, while individual dense cores can maintain near-zero decay rates. Crucially, this phenomenon is absent in control simulations excluding self-gravity. This discrepancy cannot be attributed to contamination of turbulent velocities by core contraction, as most cores in our simulations remain in a quasi-equilibrium state. Our analysis reveals that the gravitational potential energy released during core formation\textemdash not necessarily driven by self-gravity but also by turbulent compression\textemdash is sufficient to sustain the observed turbulence levels within cores.</description>

      <title>Rotationally inelastic scattering of cyanocyclopentadiene by helium atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the interstellar medium (ISM), polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are believed to be an important carbon reservoir, accounting for up to a quarter of all interstellar carbon in our galaxy. This makes the investigation of their potential formation precursors highly relevant in the context of ISM chemistry. This, in turn, includes knowing the abundance of the precursor species. One of the possible precursor molecules for PAHs is the recently detected cyanocyclopentadiene, c-C$_5$H$_5$CN. Given the physical conditions of the dense dark molecular cloud TMC-1 where the cyclic species was detected, it is crucial to consider that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions may not be satisfied. In such case an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance involves taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes, which requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant interstellar species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first potential energy surface (PES) for the interaction of the most stable isomer of cyanocyclopentadiene (1-cyano-1,3-cyclopentadiene) with He atoms is computed using the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)-F12]. The obtained PES demonstrates a high anisotropy and is characterized by a global potential well of -101.8 cm$^{-1}$. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of 1-cyano-cyclopentadiene induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum mechanical close-coupling method for total energies up to 125 cm$^{-1}$. The resulting rotational state-to-state cross sections are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favoring the transitions with $\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Milky Way: Calibrating chemical ages with high-precision Kepler data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical clocks offer a powerful tool for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic surveys. We present a new detailed spectroscopic analysis of 68 Kepler red giant stars to provide a suite of high-precision abundances along with asteroseismic ages with better than 10 percent precision from individual mode frequencies. We obtained several chemical clocks as ratios between s-process elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce) and alpha-elements (Mg, Ca, Si, Al, Ti). Our data show that [Ce/Mg] and [Zr/Ti] display a remarkably tight correlation with stellar ages, with abundance dispersions of 0.08 and 0.01 dex respectively and below 3 Gyr in ages, across the entire Galactic chronochemical history. While improving the precision floor of spectroscopic surveys is critical for broadening the scope and applicability of chemical clocks, the intrinsic accuracy of our relations -- enabled by high-resolution chemical abundances and stellar ages in our sample -- allows us to draw meaningful conclusions about age trends across stellar populations. By applying our relations to the APOGEE and Gaia-ESO surveys, we are able to differentiate the low- and high-alpha sequences in age, recover the age-metallicity relation, observe the disc flaring of the Milky Way, and identify a population of old metal-rich stars.</description>

      <title>The Infinity Galaxy: a Candidate Direct-Collapse Supermassive Black Hole Between Two Massive, Ringed Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an unusual z=1.14 object, dubbed the $\infty$ galaxy, in JWST imaging of the COSMOS field. Its rest-frame near-IR light is dominated by two compact nuclei with stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}$ Msun and a projected separation of 10 kpc. Both nuclei have a prominent ring or shell around them, giving the galaxy the appearance of a figure eight or an $\infty$ symbol. The morphology resembles that of the nearby system II Hz 4, where the head-on collision of two galaxies with parallel disks led to the formation of collisional rings around both of their bulges. Keck spectroscopy, VLA radio data, and Chandra X-ray data show that the $\infty$ galaxy hosts an actively accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH), with quasar-like radio and X-ray luminosity. Remarkably, the SMBH is not associated with either of the two nuclei, but is in between them in both position and radial velocity. Furthermore, from excess emission in the NIRCAM F150W filter we infer that the SMBH is embedded in an extended distribution of H$\alpha$-emitting gas, with a rest-frame equivalent width ranging from 400 - 2000 Angstrom. The gas spans the entire width of the system and was likely shocked and compressed at the collision site, in a galaxy-scale equivalent of what happened in the bullet cluster. We suggest that the SMBH formed within this gas in the immediate aftermath of the collision, when it was dense and highly turbulent. If corroborated with simulations and follow-up JWST spectroscopy, this would demonstrate that `direct' SMBH formation by a runaway gravitational collapse is possible in extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Further Evidence for a Direct-Collapse Origin of the Supermassive Black Hole at the Center of the Infinity Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The z=1.14 $\infty$ galaxy consists of two ringed nuclei with an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) in between them. The system is likely the result of a nearly face-on collision between two disk galaxies with massive bulges. In van Dokkum et al. (2025) we suggested that the SMBH may have formed from shocked and compressed gas at the collision site, in a runaway gravitational collapse. Here we test this hypothesis using newly obtained NIRSpec IFU observations. We first confirm that the system has a cloud of gas in between the nuclei that is photo-ionized by an AGN-like object near its center. Next, we constrain the origin of the SMBH from its radial velocity. If it formed in the cloud its velocity should be similar to the surrounding gas, whereas it would be offset if the SMBH had escaped from one of the nuclei or were associated with a faint galaxy. We find that the radial velocity of the SMBH is within $\sim 50$ km/s of that of the surrounding gas, as expected if the SMBH formed within the cloud. Unexpectedly, we find that both nuclei have active SMBHs as well, as inferred from very broad H$\alpha$ emission with FWHM $\sim 3000$ km/s. This rules out scenarios where the central SMBH was ejected from one of the nuclei in a gravitational recoil. Taken together, these results strengthen the hypothesis that the object at the center of the $\infty$ galaxy is a newly formed SMBH.</description>

      <title>Candidate Dark Galaxy-2: Validation and Analysis of an Almost Dark Galaxy in the Perseus Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Candidate Dark Galaxy-2 (CDG-2) is a potential dark galaxy consisting of four globular clusters (GCs) in the Perseus cluster, first identified in Li et al. (2025) through a sophisticated statistical method. The method searched for over-densities of GCs from a \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (\textit{HST}) survey targeting Perseus. Using the same \textit{HST} images and the new imaging data from the \textit{Euclid} survey, we report the detection of extremely faint but significant diffuse emission around the four GCs of CDG-2. We thus have exceptionally strong evidence that CDG-2 is a galaxy. This is the first galaxy detected purely through its GC population. Under the conservative assumption that the four GCs make up the entire GC population, preliminary analysis shows that CDG-2 has a total luminosity of $L_{V, \mathrm{gal}}= 6.2\pm{3.0} \times 10^6 L_{\odot}$ and a minimum GC luminosity of $L_{V, \mathrm{GC}}= 1.03\pm{0.2}\times 10^6 L_{\odot}$. Our results indicate that CDG-2 is one of the faintest galaxies having associated GCs, while at least $\sim 16.6\%$ of its light is contained in its GC population. This ratio is likely to be much higher ($\sim 33\%$) if CDG-2 has a canonical GC luminosity function (GCLF). In addition, if the previously observed GC-to-halo mass relations apply to CDG-2, it would have a minimum dark matter halo mass fraction of $99.94\%$ to $99.98\%$. If it has a canonical GCLF, then the dark matter halo mass fraction is $\gtrsim 99.99\%$. Therefore, CDG-2 may be the most GC dominated galaxy and potentially one of the most dark matter dominated galaxies ever discovered.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Metal-Poor Globular Cluster ESO 280-SC06: A Formerly Massive, Tidally Disrupted Globular Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first high-resolution abundance study of ESO 280-SC06, one of the least luminous and most metal-poor gravitationally bound Milky Way globular clusters. Using Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy for ten stars, we confirm the cluster's low metallicity as [Fe/H] = $-2.54 \pm 0.06$ and the presence of a nitrogen-enhanced star enriched by binary mass transfer. We determine abundances or abundance upper limits for 21 additional elements from the light, alpha, odd-Z, iron peak, and neutron-capture groups for all ten stars. We find no spread in neutron-capture elements, unlike previous trends identified in some metal-poor globular clusters such as M15 and M92. Eight of the ten stars have light-element abundance patterns consistent with second-population globular cluster stars, which is a significantly larger second-population fraction than would be expected from the low present-day mass of $10^{4.1}$ Msun. We estimate the initial mass of the cluster as $10^{5.4 - 5.7}$ Msun based on its orbit in the Milky Way. A preferential loss of first-population stars could explain the high fraction of second-population stars at the present time. Our results emphasize the importance of considering mass loss when studying globular clusters and their enrichment patterns.</description>

      <title>The ASAS-SN Low Surface Brightness Survey I: Proof-of-Concept and Potential Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ASAS-SN Low Surface Brightness Survey utilizes the $\sim7$ years of g-band CCD data from ASAS-SN (The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae) to create stacked images of the entire sky. It is significantly deeper than previous photographic surveys. Our median/95th percentile cumulative exposure time per field is 58.1/86.8 hours, and our median $3{\sigma}$ g-band surface brightness limit off the Galactic plane ($|b| &gt; 20{\deg}$) is 26.1 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We image large-scale diffuse structures within the Milky Way, such as multiple degree-spanning supernova remnants and star-forming nebulae, and tidal features of nearby galaxies. To quantify how effective our deep images are, we compare with a catalog of known ultra-diffuse galaxies and find a recovery rate of 82$\%$. In the future, we intend to use this data set to perform an all-sky search for new nearby dwarf galaxies, create an all-sky Galactic cirrus map, create an all-sky low surface brightness mosaic for public use, and more.</description>

      <title>The isotropy of cosmic expansion in the early and late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the isotropy of cosmic expansion by combining several probes for the first time, constructing full-sky maps of expansion rate variation using Type Ia supernovae, fundamental plane galaxies, and CMB temperature fluctuations. We find no hint of anisotropy or correlation between early- and late-Universe expansion across all systematic models. The 99% confidence upper limits on expansion rate anisotropy are 0.39% for low-redshift supernovae, 0.95% for high-redshift CMB, and 0.37% when combined at a 60-degree smoothing scale. A significant anomaly in the fundamental plane residual map may reflect systematics in the current DESI dataset, as evidenced by the absence of cross-correlation with other tracers and its correlation with spatial density variations.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Matter with Mass Segregation: A Unified Explanation of Dwarf Cores and Small-Scale Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-component SIDM models with inter-species interactions, mass segregation arises naturally from collisional relaxation, enhancing central densities and gravothermal evolution without requiring large cross sections. We propose a model with velocity-dependent interactions, both within and between species, that connects observations across several halo mass scales while remaining consistent with cluster-scale constraints. This combination enables modest mass segregation in low-mass and typical-concentration halos, consistent with recent dwarf galaxy clustering measurements. Using cosmological zoom-in simulations and controlled isolated halo studies, we show that this model produces dwarf galaxy cores that grow over time, explains the structure of dark perturbers observed in strong lensing systems, and significantly increases the number and efficiency of small-scale lenses, consistent with the galaxy-galaxy strong lensing excess reported in clusters. Our results establish mass segregation in two-component SIDM as a self-consistent and testable model capable of simultaneously addressing multiple small-scale challenges in structure formation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cosmic Dance of Repeated Nuclear Transient ASASSN-14ko: Insights from Multiwavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ASASSN-14ko is a periodically repeating nuclear transient. We conducted high-cadence, multiwavelength observations of this source, revealing several recurrent early bumps and rebrightenings in its UV/optical light curves. The energy released during these bumps and rebrightenings shows a diminishing trend in recent UV/optical outbursts, which we monitored through multiwavelength observations. These features can be ascribed to the interaction between stream debris and the expanded disk in the repeated partial tidal disruption event. The X-ray light curve exhibits an inverse pattern compared to the UV/optical bands, displaying sporadic outbursts. Furthermore, our observations demonstrate that the blackbody temperature and radius in each outburst increase with the UV/optical luminosity, and such evolution resembles that observed in X-ray quasiperiodic eruptions, whereas distinguishing it from typical tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>GalaxyGenius: A Mock Galaxy Image Generator for Various Telescopes from Hydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To advance research on galaxies in the era of large-scale sky surveys, we introduce GalaxyGenius, a Python package designed to produce synthetic galaxy images tailored to different telescopes based on hydrodynamical simulations. The package comprises three main modules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube generation, and mock observation. Specifically, the preprocessing module extracts necessary properties of star and gas particles for a selected subhalo from hydrodynamical simulations and creates the execution file for the following radiative transfer procedure. Subsequently, building on the above information, the ideal data cube generation module executes a widely-used radiative transfer project, specifically the SKIRT, to perform the SED assignment for each particle and the radiative transfer procedure to produce an IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock observation module takes the ideal data cube and applies the throughputs of aiming telescopes while also incorporating the relevant instrumental effects, point spread functions (PSFs), and background noise to generate desired mock observational images of galaxies. To showcase the outcomes of GalaxyGenius, We create a series of mock images of galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and ground-based surveys spanning from the ultraviolet to infrared wavelength coverages, including CSST, Euclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius offers a flexible framework developed to generate mock galaxy images with customizable recipes. These generated images can serve as valuable references for verifying and validating new approaches in astronomical research, and they can also act as training sets for deep learning relevant studies where real observational data are insufficient.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray line emission from hot gas in intervening galaxy halos and diffuse gas in the cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic hot gas emission is closely related to halo gas acquisition and galactic feedback processes. Their X-ray observations reveal important physical properties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However, the measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always include contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the target. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via different strategies. In this work, we aim at answering an interesting theoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from intervening hot gases of different origins. We tackle this problem with the aid of the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field lightcone and estimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting galaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the intervening hot gases into three categories, that is, the hot gas that is gravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the diffuse gas which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web structures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that permeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line emissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray band can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound to intervening galaxy halos. While the hot gas emission from the quiescent galaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along the line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as measured in the energy band of 0.4--0.85 keV can reach ~20--200 % of the emission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary models for the Very Massive Stars in the R136 cluster of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Unveiling the small-scale web around galaxies with miniJPAS and DESI: the role of local connectivity in star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first statistical observational study detecting small-scale filaments in the immediate surroundings of galaxies, i.e. the local web of galaxies. Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is channeled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct observational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of mapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data combined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a high-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8. Local filaments are detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M* $&gt; 10^9$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$, using other nearby galaxies as tracers and a probabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm, designed to overcome limitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is tested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models and reference lightcone simulations. We recover the expected increase in galaxy connectivity, defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy, with stellar mass. Interestingly, we find a persistent correlation between connectivity and star formation in medium mass galaxies (M* $= 10^{10-11}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$) in the low redshift bins. These results are consistent with the cosmic web detachment scenario, suggesting that reduced connectivity to local filaments hinders the inflow of star-forming material. We propose galaxy connectivity to local (small-scale) filaments as a powerful and physically motivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic structure in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Testing the asteroseismic estimates of stellar radii with surface brightness-colour relations and {\it Gaia} DR3 parallaxes. III. Main-sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the radii derived from the asteroseismic scaling relations with those from surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) combined with the Gaia DR3 parallaxes for main-sequence (MS) stars. The atmospheric and asteroseismic parameters were sourced from the recently released KEYSTONE catalogue and matched to Gaia DR3 and TESS Input Catalog v8.2. We computed SBCR-based radii using two different SBCRs, and estimated their relative differences with respect to radius estimates from asteroseismic grid-based methods. We find a good agreement between SBCR and asteroseismic radii, with mean relative differences in radii ($E_g$) in the range 2% to 3% and a standard deviation of about 3%. We find no dependence on parallax, and a mild dependence on [Fe/H] for one of the SBCRs tested. We find a negative correlation between $E_g$ and the stellar mass, with a slope varying from $-0.051\pm0.016$ to $-0.039\pm0.014$ per solar mass. This change in slope led to a roughly 1.5% larger discrepancy in the $E_g$ estimates for stars with masses below 1.0 $M_{\odot}$. This larger discrepancy at the low-mass end supports conclusions drawn from giant star studies. This result is independently corroborated by the LEGACY sample, which uses Kepler photometry. For the LEGACY sample we measure a mean relative offset in $E_g$ of -1.4% with a standard deviation of 2.3%, and a dependence of $E_g$ on mass with a slope of $-0.052\pm0.011$ per mass unit, both fully consistent with the KEYSTONE analysis. The [...] apparent mass dependence still requires closer examination. This result is reassuring as it demonstrates the great accuracy and reliability of the radius estimates obtained through SBCRs, which, moreover, offer the significant advantage of being applicable to a large sample of stars with substantially lower time and costs compared to what is required by asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a circularly symmetric extended diffuse radio emission around an elliptical galaxy with the VLA FIRST survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a source (J1507+3013) with an extended diffuse radio emission around an elliptical galaxy from the Very Large Array (VLA) Faint Images of Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey. J1507+3013 possesses a morphology similar to the recently identified circular, low-surface-brightness, edge-brightened radio sources commonly known as odd radio circles (ORCs). Such diffuse emissions, as reported in this paper, are also found in mini-haloes and fossil radio galaxies, but the results presented here do not match the properties of mini-haloes or of fossil radio galaxies. The extended emission observed in J1507+3013 around an elliptical galaxy is a very rare class of diffuse emission that is unlike any previously known class of diffuse emission. The extended diffuse emission of J1507+3013 is also detected in the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) at 144 MHz. J1507+3013 is hosted by an optical galaxy near the geometrical centre of the structure with a photometric redshift of $z=0.079$. The physical extent of J1507+3013 is approximately 68 kpc, with a peak-to-peak angular size of 44 arcsec. It shows a significantly higher flux density compared with previously discovered ORCs. The spectral index of J1507+3013 varies between -0.90 and -1.4 in different regions of the diffuse structure, which is comparable to the case for previously discovered ORCs but less steep than for mini-haloes and fossil radio galaxies. If we consider J1507+3013 as a candidate ORC, then this would be the closest and most luminous ORC discovered so far. This paper describes the radio, spectral, and optical/IR properties of J1507+3013 in order to study the nature of this source.</description>

      <title>The extreme starburst J1044+0353 blows kpc-scale bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16969v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a kpc-scale lacy filamentary structure in low surface-brightness H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda5007$ emission around the low-redshift, extremely metal-poor and compact reionisation-era analogue SDSS J1044+0353. We identify seven elliptical arcs in H$\alpha$ emission at $\mathrm{SB}_\mathrm{H\alpha} \sim 1 - 2 \times 10^{-18}$erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. We interpret these features as limb-brightened giant-shells that bound egg-shaped super bubbles with 3-3.5 kpc radii. These shells are significantly larger than the known giant shells around nearby star-forming dwarfs. Kinematic maps reveal a gradient perpendicular to the major-axis and line broadening in the outskirts. The latter, when interpreted due to line-splitting of the expanding shells, suggests expansion velocities of $\sim 40$km s$^{-1}$. Notably, the properties of the giant shells evade description by simple analytic prescriptions for energy- and momentum-driven super-bubbles.</description>

      <title>Effects of Environment on the Size Evolution of Quiescent Galaxies: Comparing Galaxies in Clusters and in the Field at Two Rest-frame Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of environment on quiescent galaxy (QG) size evolution using the CLAUDS+HSC imaging covering 18.6~deg$^2$ in five broad filters ($Ugriz$) and the effective radius of a single-S\'{e}rsic fit as a proxy for galaxy size. We estimate sizes in two rest-frame wavelengths -- 3000\r{A} (UV) and 5000\r{A} (optical) -- for $\sim86,000$ massive ($M_*&gt;10^{9.5}$M$_\odot$) field QGs and for $1,000$ of their similarly massive counterparts from 47 clusters at $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.85$. We fit the size-mass relation (SMR) for field and cluster QGs in five $\Delta z=0.15$ redshift bins and use the characteristic size of $M_*=5\times10^{10}$M$_\odot$ QGs (SMR's zero point) to trace the change in galaxy size over cosmic time and in two types of environment. Sizes of QGs are larger in the rest-frame UV than in the rest-frame optical in both clusters and the field, and this difference is more prominent in the field sample. However, QGs in clusters are systematically smaller than the field QGs, and this difference is significantly more pronounced if measured in the rest-frame UV light. Modeling of the redshift evolution in the characteristic QG size as $R_e\varpropto(1+z)^{\beta}$ shows that the cluster QGs ($\beta=-1.02$ in UV and $\beta= -1.00$ in optical) grow in size as fast as the field QGs ($\beta=-0.95$ in UV and $-1.22$ in optical). This fast growth of cluster QGs is consistent with size increase driven by the accretion of two subpopulations onto clusters: a) field QGs that are larger than their quiescent counterparts in clusters, and b) environmentally quenched galaxies (newcomers) that are larger than the rest of the quiescent population.</description>

      <title>The GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Programme: The NIRISS Spectroscopic Catalogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic redshift catalogue of sources in the Abell 2744 cluster field, derived from JWST/NIRISS observations taken as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science programme. We describe the data reduction, contamination modelling and source detection, as well as the data quality assessment, redshift determination and validation. The catalogue consists of 354 secure and 134 tentative redshifts, of which 245 are new spectroscopic redshifts, spanning a range $0.1 \leq z \leq 8.2$. These include 17 galaxies at the cluster redshift, one galaxy at $z \approx 8$, and a triply-imaged galaxy at $z = 2.653 \pm 0.002$. Comparing against galaxies with existing spectroscopic redshifts $z_{\rm{spec}}$, we find a small offset of $\Delta z = (z_{\rm{spec}} - z_{\rm{NIRISS}} )/(1 + z_{\rm{spec}} ) = (1.3 \pm 1.6) \times 10^{-3}$. We also present a forced extraction tool (pygrife) and a visualisation tool (pygcg) to the community, to aid with the reduction and classification of grism data. This catalogue will enable future studies of the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies throughout cosmic noon, including dust attenuation and star formation. As a first application of the catalogue, we discuss the spectroscopic confirmation of multiple image systems, and the identification of multiple overdensities at $1 &lt; z &lt; 2.7$.</description>

      <title>Describing the Non-Universal Galaxy Merger Timescales in IllustrisTNG: Effects of Host Halo Mass, Baryons, and Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy merger timescales are crucial for understanding and modeling galaxy formation in our hierarchically structured Universe. However, previous studies have reported widely varying dependencies of merger timescales on initial orbital parameters and mass ratio at the first crossing of $r_{\rm vir}$. Using IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that these dependencies vary with host halo mass, suggesting that discrepancies in prior studies may arise from differences in the systems analyzed. Specifically, in low-mass halos, merger timescales show a stronger dependence on initial orbital parameters, while in high-mass halos, this dependence weakens. To account for these variations, we present a fitting formula that incorporates host mass dependence, achieving a logarithmic scatter smaller than 0.15 dex. Comparing dark matter-only and baryonic simulations, we observe similar merger timescales for circular orbits but notable differences for radial orbits. In halos with $M_{\rm{host}} &lt; 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, mergers in dark matter-only runs take longer than in baryonic runs, whereas the trend reverses in more massive halos. We attribute these differences to the competing effects of tidal disruption by central galaxy disks and the resistance of baryonic satellites to tidal stripping. Finally, we extend our model to predict merger timescales from any starting radius within the halo. By fitting the extended model to the entire infall sample, we find that using only the merger sample can underestimate merger timescales, particularly for low mass ratios. Our model provides a valuable tool for improving semi-analytical and empirical models of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Marvelous Metals: Surveying the Circumgalactic Medium of Simulated Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are uniquely sensitive to energetic feedback processes and are known to experience substantial mass and metal loss from their disk. Here, we investigate the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 64 isolated dwarf galaxies ($6.0&lt;$log(M$_*/M_{\odot}$)$&lt;9.5$) at $z=0$ from the Marvel-ous Dwarfs and Marvelous Massive Dwarfs hydrodynamic simulations. Our galaxies produce column densities broadly consistent with current observations. We investigate these column densities in the context of mass and metal retention rates and the physical properties of the CGM. We find $48\pm11\%$ of all baryons within $R_{200c}$ reside in the CGM, with $\sim70\%$ of CGM mass existing in a warm gas phase, $10^{4.5}&lt;T&lt;10^{5.5}$ K that dominates beyond $r/R_{200c}\sim0.5$. Further, the warm and cool ($10^{4.0}&lt;T&lt;10^{4.5}$ K) gas phases each retain $5-10\%$ of metals formed by the dwarf galaxy. The significant fraction of mass and metals residing in the warm CGM phase provides an interpretation for the lack of observed low ion detections beyond $b/R_{200c}\sim0.5$ at $z\sim0$, as the majority of mass in this region exists in higher ions. We find a weak correlation between galaxy mass and total CGM metal retention despite the fraction of metals lost from the halo increasing from $\sim10\%$ to $&gt;40\%$ towards lower masses. Our findings highlight the CGM (primarily its warm component) as a key reservoir of mass and metals for dwarf galaxies across stellar masses and underscore its importance in understanding the baryon cycle in the low-mass regime. Finally, we provide individual galaxy properties of our full sample and quantify the fraction of ultraviolet observable mass to support future observational programs, particularly those aimed at performing a metal budget around dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-halo connection of disc galaxies over six orders of magnitude in stellar mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Abridged) The relations between stellar ($M_\ast$), gas ($M_{\rm gas}$), baryonic ($M_{\rm bar} = M_\ast + M_{\rm gas}$), and dark matter halo mass ($M_{200}$) provide unique constraints on galaxy formation and cosmology. The shape of the relations constrains how galaxies regulate their growth through gas accretion, star formation, and feedback; their scatter probes the stochasticity of galaxy assembly.
  Here, we assemble a sample of 49 nearby gas-rich dwarf and massive disc galaxies with unmatched ancillary data. We obtain their gas kinematics and derive their dark matter properties through rotation curve decomposition. Our sample allows us to study the galaxy-halo connection across nearly six orders of magnitude in $M_\ast$. We find that the $M_{\rm gas}-M_{200}$ relation rises monotonically, with galaxies having around 4 per cent of the average cosmological baryon fraction in cold gas. Contrastingly, the $M_\ast-M_{200}$ relation shows a more complex behaviour. A particularly interesting finding is that of a population of baryon-deficient' dwarfs (BDDs) with stellar masses $\sim 1-1.5$ orders of magnitude lower than expected from current models. Yet, baryon-rich galaxies also exist, and we find a large spread in the baryon retention fraction across our galaxies. We compare our findings with semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations. While the simulations broadly reproduce most observed features, they struggle to match the BDDs and do not capture the diversity in baryon fractions. Understanding these differences will shed new light on how feedback regulates galaxy formation. Finally, we study the dark matter halo concentration-mass relation. We find that below $M_{200} \sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, the concentrations are systematically lower than expected. We discuss whether these results stem from the influence of baryonic physics or the environment.</description>

      <title>The effect of measurement uncertainties on the inferred stability of planes of satellite galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations have revealed that the MW, Andromeda, Centaurus A (and potentially other galaxies) host spatially thin and kinematically coherent planes of satellites. Such structures are highly improbable within the standard LCDM cosmological model, and the dynamical stability of these planes has been a subject of debate for a long time. Accurately determining their stability requires a thorough understanding of orbital parameters such as proper motion, distance, and line-of-sight velocity, in addition to the gravitational potential of the host galaxy. However, many of these remain insufficiently constrained, leading to significant uncertainties in any analysis. This research aims to explore the impact of measurement errors in proper motions and distances of the satellite galaxies and in the adopted host halo mass on the inferred stability of satellite planes in Milky-Way-like potentials. Test satellite galaxies orbiting a host galaxy are simulated, mock observed by adding various degrees and types of observational errors, and then backward-integrated. Trends and correlations between the initial conditions and the applied uncertainties on the inferred orbital stability of the satellite systems are analyzed. Additionally, the effects of adopting incorrect potentials and the impact of different orbital eccentricities are considered. Uncertainties in proper motions lead to an inferred, ostensible widening of an intrinsically stable satellite plane, with its width increasing linearly with the adopted proper motion uncertainties. Even uncertainties on the level of Gaia systematics strongly affect the plane's inferred past width. Moreover, the potential with a low halo mass showed a significant impact on the stability of these planes, while the remaining two host models showed similar effects. Uncertainties in satellite distance also contribute noticeably to the inferred, apparent instability.</description>

      <title>Traces of the evolution of cosmic void galaxies: An Integral Field Spectroscopy based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies in the most underdense regions of the Universe, known as cosmic voids, exhibit astrophysical properties that suggest a distinct evolutionary path compared to galaxies in denser environments. Numerical simulations indicate that the assembly of void galaxies occurs later, leading to galaxies with younger stellar populations, low metallicities, and a high gas content in their halos, which provides the fuel to sustain elevated star formation activity. Our objective in this work is to test these numerical predictions with observational data by comparing galaxies in voids with galaxies in non-void environments. We used voids identified in SDSS data and galaxies from the MaNGA survey, which provides galaxies with integral field spectroscopy (IFS). We separated the galaxies into void and non-void samples, mimicked the magnitude distribution, and compared their integrated astrophysical properties as well as the metallicity and age profiles through a stacking technique, ETGs and LTGs separately. We find that void galaxies have younger and less metal-rich stellar populations. Regarding gas mass, we do not find differences across environments. When dividing galaxies into ETGs and LTGs, we observe that ETGs show negative gradients in both age and metallicity, with void galaxies consistently appearing younger and less metal-rich. For LTGs, age gradients are also negative, showing younger populations in void galaxies. However, we do not find statistically significant differences in stellar metallicity gradients between void and non-void environments. Our results show how the astrophysical properties of galaxies in voids differ from those of galaxies in the rest of the Universe. This suggests that the void environment plays a role in the evolution of its galaxies, delaying their assembly and growth.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs II: inclination damping for partially embedded satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of black holes on orbits with small inclinations ($i &lt; 2^\circ$) to the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei. We perform 3D adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations within a shearing frame, studying the damping of inclination by black hole-gas gravitation. We find that for objects with $i&lt;3H_0R_0^{-1}$, where $H_0R_0^{-1}$ is the disc aspect ratio, the inclination lost per midplane crossing is proportional to the inclination preceding the crossing, resulting in a net exponential decay in inclination. For objects with $i&gt;3H_0R_0^{-1}$, damping efficiency decreases for higher inclinations. We consider a variety of different AGN environments, finding that damping is stronger for systems with a higher ambient Hill mass: the initial gas mass within the BH sphere-of-influence. We provide a fitting formula for the inclination changes as a function of Hill mass. We find reasonable agreement between the damping driven by gas gravity in the simulations and the damping driven by accretion under a Hill-limited Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton prescription. We find that gas dynamical friction consistently overestimates the strength of damping, especially for lower inclination systems, by at least an order of magnitude. For regions in the AGN disc where coplanar binary black hole formation by gas dissipation is efficient, we find that the simulated damping timescales are especially short with $\tau_d &lt; 10P_\mathrm{SMBH}$. We conclude that as the timescales for inclination damping are shorter than the expected interaction time between isolated black holes, the vast majority of binaries formed from gas capture should form from components with negligible inclination to the AGN disc.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Jet Dynamics and Collimation Characteristics of 0241+622 on Parsec Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted a detailed analysis of the jet structure and dynamics of the source 0241+622 on milliarcsecond (mas) scales. We stacked images from multiple epochs to better recover the crosssection of the jet. By analyzing the relationship between jet width and distance, we observed that the jet exhibits a parabolic shape from the core, spanning a region from 0.12 to 6.1 mas. This structure suggests the acceleration and collimation processes of the jet. Beyond 18 mas from the core, the jet adopts a conical shape, and the expansion speed of the jet becomes faster within the range from 4500 to 6500 mas. We obtained the core shift of this source using five pairs of data from VLBA at 1.6 GHz to 43 GHz. Based on previous studies, through proper motion analysis of the jet components, we estimated the angle between the jet and the line of sight to be approximately 65.7{\deg}, so 1 mas corresponds to 0.95 pc (de-projected distance). We then obtained the velocity field of the source within 3.14 mas from the central black hole and found that the jet exhibits accelerated motion within this range. At approximately 6.1 mas from the core, we observed that the jet width begins to decrease, which we identified as possibly corresponding to the Bondi radius of this source. The reduction in jet width may be related to changes in the external environmental pressure, particularly within the Bondi radius, indicating that the jet dynamics and collimation characteristics are strongly influenced by the surrounding medium conditions.</description>
