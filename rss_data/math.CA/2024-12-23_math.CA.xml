      <title>The common ground of DAE approaches. An overview of diverse DAE frameworks emphasizing their commonalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze different approaches to differential-algebraic equations with attention to the implemented rank conditions of various matrix functions. These conditions are apparently very different and certain rank drops in some matrix functions actually indicate a critical solution behavior. We look for common ground by considering various index and regularity notions from literature generalizing the Kronecker index of regular matrix pencils. In detail, starting from the most transparent reduction framework, we work out a comprehensive regularity concept with canonical characteristic values applicable across all frameworks and prove the equivalence of thirteen distinct definitions of regularity. This makes it possible to use the findings of all these concepts together. Additionally, we show why not only the index but also these canonical characteristic values are crucial to describe the properties of the DAE.</description>

      <title>Representation of finite order solutions to linear differential equations with exponential sum coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a necessary and sufficient condition on the existence of finite order entire solutions of linear differential equations
  $$
  f^{(n)}+a_{n-1}f^{(n-1)}+\cdots+a_1f'+a_0f=0,\eqno(+)
  $$ where $a_i$ are exponential sums for $i=0,\ldots,n-1$ with all positive (or all negative) rational frequencies and constant coefficients. Moreover, under the condition that there exists a finite order solution of (+) with exponential sum coefficients having rational frequencies and constant coefficients, we give the precise form of all finite order solutions, which are exponential sums. It is a partial answer to Gol'dberg-Ostrovski\v{i} Problem and Problem 5 in \cite{HITW2022} since exponential sums are of completely regular growth.</description>

      <title>Fractionally modulated discrete Carleson's Theorem and pointwise Ergodic Theorems along certain curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $c\in(1,2)$ we consider the following operators \[ \mathcal{C}_{c}f(x) = \sup_{\lambda \in [-1/2,1/2)}\bigg| \sum_{n \neq 0}f(x-n) \frac{e^{2\pi i\lambda \lfloor |n|^{c} \rfloor}}{n}\bigg|\text{,}\quad \mathcal{C}^{\mathsf{sgn}}_{c}f(x) = \sup_{\lambda \in [-1/2,1/2)}\bigg| \sum_{n \neq 0}f(x-n) \frac{e^{2\pi i\lambda \mathsf{sign(n)} \lfloor |n|^{c} \rfloor}}{n}\bigg| \text{,}
  \] and prove that both extend boundedly on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$, $p\in(1,\infty)$. The second main result is establishing almost everywhere pointwise convergence for the following ergodic averages
  \[
  A_Nf(x)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(T^nS^{\lfloor n^c\rfloor}x)\text{,}
  \]
  where $T,S\colon X\to X$ are commuting measure-preserving transformations on a $\sigma$-finite measure space $(X,\mu)$, and $f\in L_{\mu}^p(X)$, $p\in(1,\infty)$. The point of departure for both proofs is the study of exponential sums with phases $\xi_2 \lfloor |n^c|\rfloor+ \xi_1n$ through the use of a simple variant of the circle method.</description>

      <title>Smoothing of the higher-order Stokes phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For nearly a century and a half the Stokes phenomenon had been perceived as a discontinuous change in the asymptotic representation of a function. In 1989 Berry demonstrated how it is possible to smooth out this discontinuity in broad classes of problems with the prefactor for the exponentially small contribution that is being switched on/off taking the universal form of an error function. Following pioneering work of Berk {\it et al.} \cite{BNR82} and the Japanese school of formally exact asymptotics \cite{Aokietal1994,AKT01}, the concept of the higher-order Stokes phenomenon was introduced in \cite{HLO04} and \cite{CM05}, whereby the ability for the exponentially small terms to cause a Stokes phenomenon may change, depending on the values of parameters in the problem, corresponding to the associated singularities in the Borel plane transitioning between different Riemann sheets. Until now, the higher-order Stokes phenomenon has also been treated as a discontinuous event. In this paper we show how the higher-order Stokes phenomenon is, in fact, also smooth and occurs universally with a prefactor that takes the form of a new special function, based on a Gaussian convolution of an error function that gives rise to a rich structure. We provide a rigorous derivation of the result, with examples spanning the gamma function, a second-order nonlinear ODE and the telegraph equation, giving rise to a ghost-like smooth contribution that is present in the vicinity of a Stokes line, but which rapidly tends to zero on either side. We also include a rigorous derivation and example of the effect of the smoothed higher-order Stokes phenomenon on the individual terms in the asymptotic series, where the additional contributions appear prefactored by an error function.</description>

      <title>Fourier Decay from $L^2$-Flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach for establishing rates of decay for the Fourier transform of a wide class of dynamically defined measures. Among the key features of the method is the systematic use of the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in \cite{Khalil-Mixing}, coupled with non-concentration estimates for the derivatives of the underlying dynamical system. This method yields polylogarithmic Fourier decay for Diophantine self-similar measures, and polynomial decay for Patterson-Sullivan measures of convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, Gibbs measures associated to non-integrable $C^2$ conformal systems, as well as stationary measures for carpet-like non-conformal iterated function systems. Applications include essential spectral gaps on convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, fractal uncertainty principles, and equidistribution properties of typical vectors in fractal sets.</description>
