      <title>Return point memory in knitted fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunable mechanical response of knitted fabrics underpins applications ranging from soft robotics and artificial muscles to morphing electromagnetic field sensors. Elasticity in fabrics emerges from the bending of yarn in the knitted structure; however, properties beyond elasticity are relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that knitted fabrics subjected to cyclic uniaxial stress exhibit significant hysteresis and the remarkable ability to "remember" their response to previous deformations -- reminiscent of classical return point memory in magnetic systems. The hysteretic behavior deviates from the two standard models of hysteresis that usually apply to solid-state materials, viscoelasticity and plasticity. Thus, we develop a phenomenological extension of the Preisach model of hysteresis which well replicates our data, and discuss implications of these results on the underlying mechanisms of memory in knitted fabrics.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium modeling of lyotropic liquid crystals: from binary simulations to multi-component theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamically consistent theoretical framework for lyotropic liquid crystals (LCs) based on the GENERIC (General Equation for the Non-Equilibrium Reversible-Irreversible Coupling) formalism. This formalism ensures conservation of energy and production of entropy, while coupling concentration, momentum balance, and liquid crystalline order. Starting from a binary nematic-isotropic mixture, we derive a theory for these key variables, which is then extended to multi-component systems.
  The binary equations are solved numerically using a Julia-based solver that relies on an upwind finite-difference scheme, enabling stable and efficient simulations capable of handling multiple time scales while satisfying fundamental mathematical constraints. The results of simulations are consistent with experimental observations of topological core defects in chromonic LCs, as well as flow-driven droplet shape transitions under Couette and Poiseuille flows.
  This work provides a platform for simulations of multi-component lyotropic LCs that can be extended to systems with multiple interfaces, active materials, and materials subject to external fields.</description>

      <title>Size control guidelines for chemically active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological cells and synthetic analogues use liquid-liquid phase separation to dynamically compartmentalize their environment for various applications. In many cases, multiple droplets need to coexist, and their size needs to be controlled, which is challenging because large droplets tend to grow at the expense of smaller ones. Chemical reactions can, in principle, control droplet sizes, but there are no clear guidelines on how to robustly achieve size control. To provide guidelines, we consider a binary fluid model driven out of equilibrium by chemical reactions. We reveal two different classes of size-controlled droplets, depending on the ratio of droplet radius to the reaction-diffusion length. Moreover, we determine parameter regimes in which droplets become small. Taken together, our theory allows us to separately predict the chemical reactions necessary for maintaining droplets of a given class or size.</description>

      <title>Harnessing swarms for directed migration of interacting active particles via optimal global control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of global control strategies to enhance the directed migration of swarms of interacting self-propelled particles confined in a channel. Uncontrolled dynamics naturally leads to wall accumulation, clogging, and band formation due to the interplay between self-organization and confinement. This work explores whether a uniform global control, such as magnetic field acting on all particles, can optimize collective transport. Using a discrete Vicsek-like model, it is found that simple global alignment controls, optimized via reinforcement learning, efficiently suppress unfavorable configurations and significantly increase the net particle flux along a prescribed channel direction. These results highlight that coarse, system-level observations are sufficient to achieve near-optimal control, even in regimes with strong fluctuations or partial ordering.</description>

      <title>Adaptive hydrogels with spatiotemporal stiffening using pH-modulating enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive material systems that autonomously respond to external stimuli are crucial for advancing next-generation smart devices. Biological systems achieve autonomous behavior by utilizing chemical energy from out-of-equilibrium reactions to power life-like functions without requiring external energy inputs. Although responsive hydrogels with embedded enzymatic reactions offer a promising platform for implementing adaptive behavior in synthetic systems, previous studies have focused on controlling the supramolecular self-assembly of responsive building blocks rather than modulating network crosslinking. Here, we demonstrate direct enzymatic modulation of crosslinking density in a double-network hydrogel to achieve autonomous self-stiffening in response to a chemical stimulus. Our adaptive system embeds glucose oxidase within a polyacrylamide-alginate double-network hydrogel containing Ca(EDTA)2- complexes that render the crosslinked alginate network pH-responsive through a competitive calcium binding mechanism. Chemical waves emerging from enzymatic reaction activation propagate at speeds ranging from 15 to 44 um/min, driving spatiotemporal mechanical transitions that increase material stiffness by up to 2.1-fold. By integrating signal sensing and chemomechanical transduction within this responsive hydrogel, we realized adaptive behavior that autonomously converts localized chemical inputs into system-wide mechanical outputs. This positions our adaptive hydrogels as promising model systems to guide the design of intelligent materials for soft robotics and biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>Protein Diffusion and Stokes-Einstein Deviation in Supercooled Cryoprotectant Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vitrification during cryopreservation requires a detailed understanding of the dynamic behavior of biological solutions. We investigate ferritin diffusion in glycerol-water mixtures at supercooled temperatures using X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). Diffusion coefficients were measured from ambient conditions to $T = 210$ K and analyzed using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation, yielding an arrest temperature of $T_0 = 85 \pm 11$ K for ferritin ($R_{\rm h} = 7.3$ nm), markedly lower than $T_0 = 122 \pm 4$ K for larger nanoparticles ($R_{\rm h} = 50$ nm). Below $T \approx 230$ K, ferritin diffusion exceeds the Stokes-Einstein prediction by up to a factor of 2.7, revealing nanoscale deviations from bulk viscosity. A fluctuating-friction model quantitatively links this enhancement to local friction heterogeneity, with fluctuations increasing upon cooling and reaching $\sim 80\%$ of the mean friction at $T=210$ K. These results establish a molecular-scale connection between protein diffusion and solvent dynamical heterogeneity in cryoprotected solutions.</description>

      <title>X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy of hydrated lysozyme at elevated pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure provides a powerful parameter to control the protein conformation state, which at sufficiently high values can lead to unfolding. Here, we investigate the effects of increasing pressure up to $0.4$ GPa on hydrated lysozyme proteins, by measuring the nanoscale stress relaxation induced and probed by X-rays. Structural and dynamical information at elevated pressures was obtained using X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) in combination with a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The dynamical analysis revealed a slowing down of the system up to $0.2$ GPa, followed by a re-acceleration at $0.4$ GPa. A similar non-monotonic behavior was observed both in the Porod and Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) exponents, consistently indicating a crossover between $0.2$ and $0.4$ GPa. These findings suggest the presence of pressure-induced structural changes that impact protein collective stress-relaxation as the system transitions from a jammed state to an elastically driven regime. These results may be relevant for a deeper understanding of protein stability under compression as well as for practical high-pressure technologies, including food processing and pharmaceutical applications.</description>

      <title>Modulation of DNA rheology by a transcription factor that forms aging microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins and nucleic acids form non-Newtonian liquids with complex rheological properties that contribute to their function in vivo. Here we investigate the rheology of the transcription factor NANOG, a key protein in sustaining embryonic stem cell self-renewal. We discover that at high concentrations NANOG forms macroscopic aging gels through its intrinsically disordered tryptophan-rich domain. By combining molecular dynamics simulations, mass photometry and Cryo-EM, we also discover that NANOG forms self-limiting micelle-like clusters which expose their DNA-binding domains. In dense solutions of DNA, NANOG micelle-like structures stabilize intermolecular entanglements and crosslinks, forming microgel-like structures. Our findings suggest that NANOG may contribute to regulate gene expression in a unconventional way: by restricting and stabilizing genome dynamics at key transcriptional sites through the formation of an aging microgel-like structure, potentially enabling mechanical memory in the gene network.</description>

      <title>How Quorum Sensing Shapes Clustering in Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles undergoing persistent motion can accumulate either through excluded-volume interactions or through quorum sensing, where self-propulsion decreases at high local density. Using kinetic balance theory and simulations, we show that the interplay of these two mechanisms produces a reentrant, non-monotonic behavior in which clustering passes through a pronounced minimum as quorum-sensing strength or persistence time varies. Beyond a threshold quorum-sensing strength, we find long-lived transient states that retain memory of initial conditions, including kinetically arrested active gels. Although quorum sensing can mimic attractive interactions, it also acts strongly in dilute regions, producing an effective cluster bistability that is captured by our theory. Our results explain collective states observed experimentally in synthetic and biological active systems.</description>

      <title>Probing the Microscopic Origin of Toughness in Multiple Polymer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple polymer networks, such as double-network elastomers comprising a sacrificial and a matrix network, exhibit exceptional mechanical resilience, commonly attributed to the formation of an extended damage zone before a crack can grow. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying their toughness remain poorly understood. Here, we combine advanced light scattering methods and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the microscopic relaxation dynamics and stress redistribution at the polymer strand scale of single-network and double-network elastomers under uni-axial loading. Dynamic light scattering experiments show that microscopic rearrangements and bond-breaking events are localized near the crack tip in single networks, readily causing the crack to advance. In contrast, double networks exhibit delocalized microscopic rearrangements well ahead of and not directly correlated with crack propagation, enabling the dissipation of energy over broader regions and timescales. Numerical simulations of the damage zone show that bond breaking in the matrix network of double networks leads to widespread stress redistribution, mitigating catastrophic damage localization. This enhanced ability to redistribute stress in a non-local manner allows a much larger extension before localized macroscopic failure occurs, explaining the superior toughness of double networks. Our findings identify early, delocalized bond-breaking events combined with more efficient dissipation pathways through enhanced microscopic rearrangements as the key microscopic mechanisms responsible for the outstanding toughness and extensibility of multiple elastomer networks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced particle diffusion in fluctuating binary environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate single-particle diffusion in a two-state Langevin model where the friction coefficient randomly switches between low-friction (liquid-like) and high-friction (glassy-like) states. The dynamics are governed by the ratio between the friction switching time $\tau$ and the intrinsic velocity relaxation time $\tau_0$. For fast switching ($\tau/\tau_0 \lesssim 1$) the motion is homogeneous and Brownian, whereas for slow switching ($\tau/\tau_0 \gg 1$) the particle exhibits intermittent dynamics and an enhanced diffusion coefficient. Analysis of the single-particle overlap function $Q(t)$ and the dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$ reveals decoupling of the diffusion coefficient from the average friction upon cooling, which coincides with increasing temporal dynamic heterogeneity. This minimal model provides a transparent framework for understanding single-particle transport in media with fluctuating local mobility, including supercooled liquids and phase-separated soft materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multistability-induced hysteresis has been widely studied in mechanical systems, but such behavior has proven more difficult to reproduce experimentally in flow networks. Natural flow networks like animal and plant vasculature can exhibit complex nonlinear behavior to facilitate fluid transport, so multistable flows may inform their functionality. To probe such phenomena in an analogous model system, we utilize an electronic network of hysteretic bistable resistors designed to have tunable negative differential resistivity. We demonstrate our system's capability to generate complex global memory states in the form of voltage patterns, which is mediated by the tunable nonlinearity of each element's current-voltage characteristic. We investigate avalanching behavior arising from effective interactions, and demonstrate how to encode explicit interactions of arbitrary form by taking advantage of the tunable circuitry design.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of Chiral Active Brownian Particles at Low Densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral active matter is a variant of active matter systems in which the motion of the constituent particles violates mirror symmetry. In this letter, we simulate two-dimensional chiral Active Brownian Particles, the simplest chiral model in which each particle undergoes circular motion, and show that the system crystallizes at low densities well below the melting point of the equilibrium counterpart. Crystallization is only possible if the orbital radius is long enough to align the circulating particles, but short enough for neighboring particles to avoid collisions. Of course, the system must be driven sufficiently far from equilibrium, since chirality cannot affect thermodynamic properties in classical equilibrium systems. The fluid-crystal phase diagram shows a re-entrant melting transition as a function of the radius of the circles. We show that at least one of the two transitions follows the same two-step melting scenario as in equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of discrete-symmetry flocks: sandwich state, traveling domains and motility-induced pinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polar flocks in discrete active systems are often assumed to be robust, yet recent studies reveal their fragility under both imposed and spontaneous fluctuations. Here, we revisit the four-state active Potts model (APM) and show that its globally ordered phase is metastable across a broad swath of parameter space. Small counter-propagating droplets disrupt the flocking phase by inducing a persistent sandwich state, where the droplet-induced opposite-polarity lane remains embedded within the original flock, particularly pronounced at low noise, influenced by spatial anisotropy. In contrast, small transversely propagating droplets, when introduced into the flock, can trigger complete phase reversal due to their alignment orthogonal to the dominant flow and their enhanced persistence. At low diffusion and strong self-propulsion, such transverse droplets also emerge spontaneously, fragmenting the flock into multiple traveling domains and giving rise to a short-range order (SRO) regime. We further identify a motility-induced pinning (MIP) transition in small diffusion and low-temperature regimes when particles of opposite polarity interact, flip their state, hop, and pin an interface. Our comprehensive phase diagrams, encompassing full reversal, sandwich coexistence, stripe bands, SRO, and MIP, delineate how thermal fluctuations, self-propulsion strength, and diffusion govern flock stability in discrete active matter systems.</description>

Abstract: The rheological behaviour of a polymer was investigated by performing numerical simulations in complex flow and comparing them to experiments. For our simulations, we employed a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics scheme, utilizing an integral fractional model based on the K-BKZ framework. The results are compared with experiments performed on melt-state isotactic polypropylene under medium and large amplitude oscillatory shear.
  The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the model is able to capture and predict both the linear and the non-linear viscoelastic behaviours of the polymer melt. Results show that equipping SPH with an integral fractional model is promising approach for the simulation of complex polymeric materials under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Topological Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Water Structure at Charged Interfaces Studied by Depth Resolved Vibrational SFG/DFG Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The molecular water structure at charged aqueous interfaces is shaped by interfacial electric fields, which can induce significant anisotropy in the molecular orientations extending over nanometer-scale distances. Despite great relevance, very little is known about the details of this depth-dependent anisotropic water structure, mainly due to the lack of appropriate experimental techniques. Here, we present a depth-resolved study of the water anisotropy at the interface to insoluble charged surfactants using a newly developed technique which allows for directly correlating nonlinear vibrational spectra with depth information on the nanometer scale. We demonstrate that the obtained data allows for a full reconstruction of the nonlinear vibrational responses as function of depth. The results for the case of low salinity solutions show the presence of two pronounced regions within the interfacial anisotropy with largely deviating degrees of preferential molecular orientations. A spectral analysis of the depth-dependent vibrational responses furthermore reveals that the natural local hydrogen-bond structure of bulk water remains largely unperturbed throughout the interfacial region, including water in direct proximity of the surface charges. These findings significantly refine our understanding of the anisotropic water structure at the interface to hydrophilic charged surfactants and showcase the large potential of our depth-resolved spectroscopic technique.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength transparent microfluidics for UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray scattering studies of photoactive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.</description>
