      <title>Dissipative Superfluidity in a Molecular Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental realization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of dipolar molecules, we develop superfluid transport theory for a dissipative BEC to show that a weak uniform two-body loss can induce phase rigidity, leading to superfluid transport of bosons. A generalized f-sum rule is shown to hold for a dissipative superfluid as a consequence of weak U(1) symmetry. It is also demonstrated that dissipation enhances the stability of a molecular BEC with dipolar interactions. Possible experimental situations for measuring the superfluid fraction and the spectral function are discussed.</description>

      <title>Beyond mean-field effects in dynamics of BEC in the double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of a quasi-1D BEC loaded in a double-well potential is studied. The beyond mean-field corrections to the energy in the form of the Lee-Huang-Yang term are taken into account. One-dimensional geometry is considered. The problem is described in the scalar approximation by the extended Gross-Pitaevskii (EGP) equation with the attractive quadratic nonlinearity, due to the Lee-Huang-Yang correction, and the effective cubic mean-field nonlinearity describing the residual intra- and inter-species interactions. To describe tunneling and localization phenomena, a two-mode model was obtained. The frequencies of the Josephson oscillations are found and confirmed by the full numerical simulations of the EGP equation. The parametric resonance in the Josephson oscillations, when the height of the barrier is periodically modulated, is studied. The predictions of the dimer model, including the case of the one-dimensional Lee-Huang-Yang superfluid, have been proven.</description>

      <title>Mutual dipolar drag in a bilayer Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional spin-polarized dipolar Fermi gases confined in a double-layer system and calculate the momentum transfer between the layers as a function of temperature to investigate the transport properties of the system. We use the Hubbard approximation to describe the correlation effects and the screening between the dipoles within a single layer. The effective interlayer interaction between the dipoles across the layers is obtained by the random-phase approximation. We calculate the interaction strength and the layer separation distance dependence of the drag rate, and we show that there is a critical distance below which the system is unstable. In addition, we calculate the typical behavior of the collective modes related to the density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Meandering conduction channels and the tunable nature of quantized charge transport</title>

Abstract: The discovery of the quantum Hall effect founded the field of topological condensed matter physics. Its amazingly accurate quantisation of the Hall conductance, now enshrined in quantum metrology, is topologically protected: it is stable against any reasonable perturbation. Conversely, topological protection thus implies a form of censorship, as it completely hides any local information from the observer. The spatial distribution of the current in the sample is such a piece of information, which however has now become accessible thanks to spectacular experimental advances. It is an old question whether an original, and intuitively compelling, picture of the current flowing in a narrow channel along the sample edge is the physically correct one. Motivated by recent experiments $\textit{locally}$ imaging the quantized current flow in a Chern insulating (Bi, Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructure, [Rosen et al., PRL 129, 246602 (2022); Ferguson et.al, Nat. Mater. 22, 1100-1105 (2023)], we theoretically demonstrate the possibility of a broad `edge state' meandering away from the sample boundary deep into the sample bulk. Further, we show that varying experimental parameters permits continuously tuning between narrow edge states and meandering channels all the way to incompressible bulk transport. This accounts for various features observed in, and differing between, experiments. Overall, this underscores the robustness of topological condensed matter physics, but it also unveils a phenomenological richness hidden by topological censorship -- much of which we believe remains to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Field-sensitive dislocation bound states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet is grown on a substrate, the interplay of momentum-dependent spin splittings arising from altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a nodal band structure with band degeneracies enforced by a $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. If we break the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry by an exchange field, the band degeneracies are found to be immediately lifted, leading to a topological band structure characterized by nontrivial strong and weak topological indices. Remarkably, both the strong topological index and the $Z_{2}$-valued weak topological indices depend sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. As a consequence of the bulk-defect correspondence, we find that the unique dependence of weak topological indices on the exchange field in this system dictates that the presence or absence of topological bound states at lattice dislocations also depends sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. When the substrate is an $s$-wave superconductor, we find that a similar dependence of band topology on the exchange field gives rise to field-sensitive dislocation Majorana zero modes. As topological dislocation bound states are easily detectable by scanning tunneling microscopy, our findings unveil a promising experimental diagnosis of altermagnetic materials among an ever growing list of candidates.</description>

      <title>Validity of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem asserts that microscopic details of the system can impose non-trivial constraints on the system's low-energy properties. While traditionally applied to short-range interaction systems, where locality ensures a vanishing spectral gap in large system size limit, the impact of long-range interactions on the LSM theorem remains an open question. Long-range interactions are prevalent in experimental platforms such as Rydberg atoms, dipolar quantum gases, polar molecules, optical cavities, and trapped ions, where the interaction decay exponent can be experimentally tuned. We extend the LSM theorem in one dimension to long-range interacting systems and find that the LSM theorem holds for exponentially or power-law two-body interactions with a decay exponent $\alpha &gt; 2$. However, for power-law interactions with $\alpha &lt; 2$, the constraints of the LSM theorem on the ground state do not apply. Numerical simulations of long-range versions of the Heisenberg and Majumdar-Ghosh models, both satisfying the LSM symmetry requirements, are also provided. Our results suggest promising directions for experimental validation of the LSM theorem in systems with tunable long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and eigenstate correlations in strongly disordered quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The many-body localised phase of quantum systems is an unusual dynamical phase wherein the system fails to thermalise and yet, entanglement grows unboundedly albeit very slowly in time. We present a microscopic theory of this ultraslow growth of entanglement in terms of dynamical eigenstate correlations of strongly disordered, interacting quantum systems in the many-body localised regime. These correlations involve sets of four or more eigenstates and hence, go beyond correlations involving pairs of eigenstates which are usually studied in the context of eigenstate thermalisation or lack thereof. We consider the minimal case, namely the second R\'enyi entropy of entanglement, of an initial product state as well as that of the time-evolution operator, wherein the correlations involve quartets of four eigenstates. We identify that the dynamics of the entanglement entropy is dominated by the spectral correlations within certain special quartets of eigenstates. We uncover the spatial structure of these special quartets and the ensuing statistics of the spectral correlations amongst the eigenstates therein, which reveals a hierarchy of timescales or equivalently, energyscales. We show that the hierarchy of these timescales along with their non-trivial distributions conspire to produce the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement, characteristic of the many-body localised regime. The underlying spatial structures in the set of special quartets also provides a microscopic understanding of the spacetime picture of the entanglement growth. The theory therefore provides a much richer perspective on entanglement growth in strongly disordered systems compared to the commonly employed phenomenological approach based on the $\ell$-bit picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental viability of cooling ultracold atomic gases with quantum feedback control. Our study shows that the trade-off between the resolution and destructiveness of optical imaging techniques imposes constraints on the efficacy of feedback cooling, and that rapid rethermalization is necessary for cooling thermal gases. We construct a simple model to determine the limits to feedback cooling set by the visibility of density fluctuations, measurement-induced heating, and three-body atomic recombination. We demonstrate that feedback control can rapidly cool high-temperature thermal clouds in quasi-2D geometries to degenerate temperatures with minimal atom loss compared to traditional evaporation. Our analysis confirms the feasibility of feedback cooling ultracold atomic gases, providing a pathway to new regimes of cooling not achievable with current approaches.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical descriptions of dissipative dynamics of strongly interacting Bose gases in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop semiclassical methods for describing real-time dynamics of dissipative Bose-Hubbard systems in a strongly interacting regime, which can be realized in experiments with ultracold gases. Specifically, we present two kinds of SU(3) truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for solving an effective Lindblad master equation of the systems. The first one employs the discrete TWA for finite levels or spin systems and is based on a classical equation of motion in which the onsite dissipation term, as well as the onsite interaction term, is linearized in the phase space variables. The other approach utilizes a stochastic Langevin equation, including decoherence effects in terms of nonlinear drift force and stochastic force terms, in which the initial conditions of trajectories are weighted with a quasiprobability distribution for a typical initial quantum state. We apply these methods to the systems with two-body losses and compare their results with the exact numerical solutions for a small system. We show that the former approach can simulate correctly longer-time dynamics than the latter one. We also calculate the time evolution for a large size setup that is comparable to experiments. We numerically demonstrate that the discrete TWA approach is able to qualitatively capture the continuous quantum Zeno effect on dynamics subjected to a gradual change of the ratio between the hopping amplitude and the onsite interaction across the superfluid-Mott insulator crossover, which has been observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Wave function matching transformation for solving the quantum many-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for solving quantum many-body systems called wave function matching. Wave function matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wave functions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible due to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancelations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter, and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by new insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii, and nuclear matter saturation in ab initio calculations.</description>

Abstract: For decades, frustrated quantum magnets have been a seed for scientific progress and innovation in condensed matter. As much as the numerical tools for low-dimensional quantum magnetism have thrived and improved in recent years due to breakthroughs inspired by quantum information and quantum computation, higher-dimensional quantum magnetism can be considered as the final frontier, where strong quantum entanglement, multiple ordering channels, and manifold ways of paramagnetism culminate. At the same time, efforts in crystal synthesis have induced a significant increase in the number of tangible frustrated magnets which are generically three-dimensional in nature, creating an urgent need for quantitative theoretical modeling. We review the pseudo-fermion (PF) and pseudo-Majorana (PM) functional renormalization group (FRG) and their specific ability to address higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnetism. First developed more than a decade ago, the PFFRG interprets a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian in terms of Abrikosov pseudofermions, which is then treated in a diagrammatic resummation scheme formulated as a renormalization group flow of $m$-particle pseudofermion vertices. The article reviews the state of the art of PFFRG and PMFRG and discusses their application to exemplary domains of frustrated magnetism, but most importantly, it makes the algorithmic and implementation details of these methods accessible to everyone. By thus lowering the entry barrier to their application, we hope that this review will contribute towards establishing PFFRG and PMFRG as the numerical methods for addressing frustrated quantum magnetism in higher spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Neural-network quantum state study of the long-range antiferromagnetic Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum phase transitions in the transverse field Ising chain with algebraically decaying long-range (LR) antiferromagnetic interactions using the variational Monte Carlo method with the restricted Boltzmann machine employed as a trial wave function ansatz. First, we measure the critical exponents and the central charge through the finite-size scaling analysis, verifying the contrasting observations in the previous tensor network studies. The correlation function exponent and the central charge deviate from the short-range (SR) Ising values at a small decay exponent $\alpha_\mathrm{LR}$, while the other critical exponents examined are very close to the SR Ising exponents regardless of $\alpha_\mathrm{LR}$ examined. However, in the further test of the critical Binder ratio, we find that the universal ratio of the SR limit does not hold for $\alpha_\mathrm{LR} &lt; 2$, implying a deviation in the criticality. On the other hand, we find evidence of the conformal invariance breakdown in the conformal field theory (CFT) test of the correlation function. The deviation from the CFT description becomes more pronounced as $\alpha_\mathrm{LR}$ decreases, although a precise breakdown threshold is yet to be determined.</description>

      <title>Anomaly in open quantum systems and its implications on mixed-state quantum phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type. By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we incorporate them in a unified framework that enables a direct calculation of their anomalies. In the case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases as long as the weak symmetry is imposed. Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial steady states and long-time dynamics for open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. Notably, we identify a novel $(1+1)$-D mixed-state quantum phase that has no counterpart in closed systems, where the steady state shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We further establish the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.</description>
