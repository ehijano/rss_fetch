      <title>Sharp lower bounds for the first eigenvalue of Steklov-type eigenvalue problems on a compact surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a compact surface with smooth boundary and the geodesic curvature $k_g \ge {c &gt; 0}$ along $\partial \Omega$ for some constant $c \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that, if the Gaussian curvature satisfies $K \ge -\alpha$ for a constant $\alpha \ge 0$, then the first eigenvalue $\sigma_1$ of the Steklov-type eigenvalue problem satisfies \[ \sigma_1 + \frac{\alpha}{\sigma_1} \ge c. \] Moreover, equality holds if and only if $\Omega$ is a Euclidean disk of radius $\frac{1}{c}$ and $\alpha = 0$. Furthermore, we obtain a sharp lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the fourth-order Steklov-type eigenvalue problem on $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Quantum propagation for Berezin-Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.05279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the asymptotic behaviour of the quantum propagator generated by a Berezin-Toeplitz operator with real-valued principal symbol. We also give precise asymptotics for smoothed spectral projectors associated with the operator in the autonomous case; this leads us to introducting quantum states associated with immersed Lagrangian submanifolds. These descriptions involve geometric quantities of two origins, coming from lifts of the Hamiltonian flow to the prequantum bundle and the canonical bundle respectively. The latter are the main contribution of this article and are connected to the Maslov indices appearing in trace formulas, as will be explained in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>Bounds to the mean curvature of leaves of CMC foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this present paper is to bring the results proved by Barbosa, Kenmotsu and Oshikiri (1991) and its ideas to a perspective where the Ricci curvature is bounded from below. For instance, for a foliation by CMC hypersurfaces on a compact (without boundary) Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below by $-nK_0\leq 0$ and such that the mean curvature $H$ of the leaves of the foliation satisfies $|H|\geq \sqrt{K_0}$, we prove that $|H|\equiv \sqrt{K_0}$ and all the leaves are totally umbilical. This gives, in particular, a generalization for the result proved by Barbosa, Kenmotsu and Oshikiri (1991), where the above result was proved in the case $K_0=0$. We also obtain a proof of the following: for a foliation by CMC hypersurfaces on a compact (without boundary) Riemannian manifold $M$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below by $-nK_0\leq 0$, the mean curvature $H$ of the leaves of the foliation satisfies $|H|\leq \sqrt{K_0}$. Furthermore, if the foliation contains a leaf $L$ whose absolute mean curvature is $|H_L|=\sqrt{K_0}$, then either $K_0=0$ and all the leaves of $\mathfrak{F}$ are totally geodesic, or $K_0&gt;0$ and there is a totally umbilical leaf.</description>

      <title>Arnold-Thom conjecture for the arrival time of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following \L ojasiewicz's uniqueness theorem and Thom's gradient conjecture, Arnold proposed a stronger version about the existence of limit tangents of gradient flow lines for analytic functions. We prove \L ojasiewicz's theorem and Arnold's conjecture in the context of arrival time functions for mean curvature flows in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ with neck or non-degenerate cylindrical singularities. In particular, we prove the conjectures for all mean convex mean curvature flows of surfaces, including the cases when the arrival time functions are not $C^2.$ The results also apply to mean curvature flows starting from two-spheres or generic closed surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the homotopy invariance of the twisted Lie algebroid cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted Lie algebroid cohomologies, i.e. with values in representations, are shown to be Lie algebroid homotopy-invariant. Several important classes of examples are discussed. As an application, a generalized version of the Poincar\'e lemma is given in the transitive case. Together with the Mayer-Vietoris theorem, which holds in this more general context as well, this leads to a K\"unneth formula for the cohomologies of Lie algebroids with values in representations. In particular, this comprehensive paper gives a systematic way to compute explicitly the twisted Lie algebroid cohomologies of some transitive and almost transitive Lie algebroids.</description>

      <title>The Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: P. Salani [Adv. Math., 229 (2012)] introduced the $k$-torsional rigidity associated with a $k$-Hessian equation and obtained the Brunn-Minkowski inequalities $w.r.t.$ the torsional rigidity in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Following this work, we first construct, in the present paper, a Hadamard variational formula for the $k$-torsional rigidity with $1\leq k\leq n-1$, then we can deduce a $k$-torsional measure from the Hadamard variational formula. Based on the $k$-torsional measure, we propose the Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity and confirm the existence of its smooth non-even solutions by the method of a curvature flow. Specially, a new proof method for the uniform lower bound estimation in the $C^0$ estimation for the solution to the curvature flow is presented with the help of invariant functional $\Phi(\Omega_t)$.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of synthetic null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a synthetic framework for the geometric and analytic study of null (lightlike) hypersurfaces in non-smooth spacetimes. Drawing from optimal transport and recent advances in Lorentzian geometry and causality theory, we define a \emph{synthetic null hypersurface} as a triple $(H, G, \mathfrak{m})$: $H$ is a closed achronal set in a topological causal space, $G$ is a gauge function encoding affine parametrizations along null generators, and $\mathfrak{m}$ is a Radon measure serving as a synthetic analog of the rigged measure. This generalizes classical differential geometric structures to potentially singular spacetimes.
  A central object is the \emph{synthetic null energy condition} ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$), defined via the concavity of an entropy power functional along optimal transport, with parametrization given by the gauge $G$. This condition is invariant under changes of gauge and measure within natural equivalence classes. It agrees with the classical Null Energy Condition in the smooth setting and it applies to low-regularity spacetimes. A key property of ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$) is the stability under convergence of synthetic null hypersurfaces, inspired by measured Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.
  As a first application, we obtain a synthetic version of Hawking's area theorem. Moreover, we extend the celebrated Penrose's singularity theorem to continuous spacetimes and prove the existence of trapped regions in the general setting of topological causal spaces satisfying the synthetic ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$).</description>

      <title>The linearizability of singular foliations is a Morita invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hausdorff Morita equivalence is an equivalence relation on singular foliations, which induces a bijection between their leaves. Our main statement is that linearizability along a leaf is invariant under Hausdorff Morita equivalence. The proof relies on a characterization of tubular neighborhood embeddings using Euler-like vector fields.</description>
