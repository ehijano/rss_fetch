      <title>Extreme radiation emission regime for electron beams in strong focusing ion channels and undulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental comparison between undulator and ion channel radiation is presented. Conventional theory for both devices fails to describe high $k$ and $K/\gamma$ regimes accurately, providing an underestimation of particle trajectory amplitude and period. This may lead to incorrect estimation of radiation emission in many setups of practical interest, such as the ion column. A redefinition of plasma density and undulator strength expressions leads to a more reliable prediction of particle behaviour, reproducing the closest possible conditions in the two devices and correctly matching expected betatron oscillation amplitude and wavelength for a wide range of $K/\gamma$ values. Differences in spectral features of the two devices can then be addressed via numerical simulations of single particle and beam dynamics. In this paper we outline a theoretical framework and compare its results with numerical simulation applied to setups eligible for possible radiation sources.</description>

      <title>Chisel-edged screens to reduce loss in highly overmoded THz iris lines with finite screen thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we report observations on the growth trends of diffraction power loss and ohmic power loss, as functions of screen thickness, in highly overmoded THz iris-line waveguides that are constructed from thin screens. Recent theoretical developments have given a detailed field description, including eigen and transient analyses, that characterizes such waveguides under paraxial dipole-mode excitation. Informed by these analyses, we can better estimate -- and minimize -- power loss effects due to finite screen thickness in practical realizations. A geometric variation is proposed whereby we limit the growth trend in ohmic loss, even when using relatively thicker screens in practice.</description>

      <title>Strain Optimization for ReBCO High-Temperature Superconducting Stellarator Coils in SIMSOPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides an optimization mechanism to ensure the compatibility of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxide) high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes with non-planar stellarator coils. ReBCO coils enable higher field strengths and operating temperatures for the magnet systems of future fusion reactors but are sensitive to strain due to their brittle, ceramic functional layer. We have implemented a metric to optimize strain on stellarator coils made from ReBCO superconductors into the stellarator optimization framework \texttt{SIMSOPT} and used it to design new stellarator coil configurations. To ensure structural integrity of coils wound with HTS tape, we introduce a penalty on binormal curvature and torsion along a coil. It can be used to optimize the orientation of the winding path for a given coil filament or to jointly optimize orientation and coil filament. We apply the strain optimization to three cases. For the EPOS (Electrons and Positrons in an Optimized Stellarator) design, we combine the strain penalty with an objective for quasisymmetry into a single-stage optimization; this enables us to find a configuration with excellent quasisymmetry at the smallest possible size compatible with the use of ReBCO tape. For CSX (Columbia Stellarator eXperiment), in addition to HTS strain, we add a penalty to prevent net tape rotation to ease the coil winding process. If the strain is calculated for a coil at reactor scale, we find a considerable variation of the binormal and torsional strain over the cross section of the large winding pack (0.5\,m x 0.5\,m). By exploiting the overall orientation of the winding pack as a degree of freedom, we can reduce binormal and torsional strains below limits for every ReBCO stack.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Compressors for MeV-UED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic compressors offer an attractive path toward jitter-free bunch compression in MeV-UED. Compared with RF bunchers, magnetic compressors do not introduce additional timing jitter and can be configured to minimize timing jitter due to upstream energy fluctuation. In this work we discuss the principles of designing magnetic compressors for MeV-UED. Start-to-end simulation of a dogleg compressor is presented. Results show a bunch length of 11 fs and arrival time jitter of 8 fs can be achieved at 100 fC charge with small emittance growth.</description>
