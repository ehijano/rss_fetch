      <title>Estimation of the complier causal hazard ratio under dependent censoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in studying the causal effect of an endogenous binary treatment on a dependently censored duration outcome. By dependent censoring, it is meant that the duration time ($T$) and right censoring time ($C$) are not statistically independent of each other, even after conditioning on the measured covariates. The endogeneity issue is handled by making use of a binary instrumental variable for the treatment. To deal with the dependent censoring problem, it is assumed that on the stratum of compliers: (i) $T$ follows a semiparametric proportional hazards model; (ii) $C$ follows a fully parametric model; and (iii) the relation between $T$ and $C$ is modeled by a parametric copula, such that the association parameter can be left unspecified. In this framework, the treatment effect of interest is the complier causal hazard ratio (CCHR). We devise an estimation procedure that is based on a weighted maximum likelihood approach, where the weights are the probabilities of an observation coming from a complier. The weights are estimated non-parametrically in a first stage, followed by the estimation of the CCHR. Novel conditions under which the model is identifiable are given, a two-step estimation procedure is proposed and some important asymptotic properties are established. Simulations are used to assess the validity and finite-sample performance of the estimation procedure. Finally, we apply the approach to estimate the CCHR of both job training programs on unemployment duration and periodic screening examinations on time until death from breast cancer. The data come from the National Job Training Partnership Act study and the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York experiment respectively.</description>

      <title>Online Multivariate Regularized Distributional Regression for High-dimensional Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic electricity price forecasting (PEPF) is a key task for market participants in short-term electricity markets. The increasing availability of high-frequency data and the need for real-time decision-making in energy markets require online estimation methods for efficient model updating. We present an online, multivariate, regularized distributional regression model, allowing for the modeling of all distribution parameters conditional on explanatory variables. Our approach is based on the combination of the multivariate distributional regression and an efficient online learning algorithm based on online coordinate descent for LASSO-type regularization. Additionally, we propose to regularize the estimation along a path of increasingly complex dependence structures of the multivariate distribution, allowing for parsimonious estimation and early stopping. We validate our approach through one of the first forecasting studies focusing on multivariate probabilistic forecasting in the German day-ahead electricity market while using only online estimation methods. We compare our approach to online LASSO-ARX-models with adaptive marginal distribution and to online univariate distributional models combined with an adaptive Copula. We show that the multivariate distributional regression, which allows modeling all distribution parameters - including the mean and the dependence structure - conditional on explanatory variables such as renewable in-feed or past prices provide superior forecasting performance compared to modeling of the marginals only and keeping a static/unconditional dependence structure. Additionally, online estimation yields a speed-up by a factor of 80 to over 400 times compared to batch fitting.</description>

      <title>Optimal Shrinkage Estimation of Fixed Effects in Linear Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shrinkage methods are frequently used to estimate fixed effects to reduce the noisiness of the least squares estimators. However, widely used shrinkage estimators guarantee such noise reduction only under strong distributional assumptions. I develop an estimator for the fixed effects that obtains the best possible mean squared error within a class of shrinkage estimators. This class includes conventional shrinkage estimators and the optimality does not require distributional assumptions. The estimator has an intuitive form and is easy to implement. Moreover, the fixed effects are allowed to vary with time and to be serially correlated, and the shrinkage optimally incorporates the underlying correlation structure in this case. In such a context, I also provide a method to forecast fixed effects one period ahead.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Student's t-distribution with method of moments moving estimator for nonstationary time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real life time series are usually nonstationary, bringing a difficult question of model adaptation. Classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH assume arbitrary type of dependence. To avoid their bias, we will focus on recently proposed agnostic philosophy of moving estimator: in time $t$ finding parameters optimizing e.g. $F_t=\sum_{\tau&lt;t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_\tau))$ moving log-likelihood, evolving in time. It allows for example to estimate parameters using inexpensive exponential moving averages (EMA), like absolute central moments $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ evolving for one or multiple powers $p\in\mathbb{R}^+$ using $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. Application of such general adaptive methods of moments will be presented on Student's t-distribution, popular especially in economical applications, here applied to log-returns of DJIA companies. While standard ARMA-ARCH approaches provide evolution of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, here we also get evolution of $\nu$ describing $\rho(x)\sim |x|^{-\nu-1}$ tail shape, probability of extreme events - which might turn out catastrophic, destabilizing the market.</description>
