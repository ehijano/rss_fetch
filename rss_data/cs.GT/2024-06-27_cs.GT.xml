      <title>Demand Analysis and Customized Product Offering Design on E-Commerce Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It can be observed that the purchasing decision of an individual consumer in an electronic marketplace is determined by a set of factors, such as personal characteristics of the consumer, product pricing, minimum price-quantity combination offered, decision-making space, and underlying motivation of the consumer. These factors are combined to form a consumer's choice problem domain, which plays a pivotal role in the product offering. In this study, we attempt to focus on how the products? Offered can be customized by incorporating the quantity and pack size of the products along with the factors above to form a more extensive domain for examining the combined effects of all of these factors on demand. Accordingly, the demand function is defined by a novel method invoking the extended domain of choice problem in the electronic marketplace. Consequently, the predictable uncertainty associated with the consumer's demand function may disappear, increase the likelihood of earning optimum revenue through customized combinations of the components of the extended domain of choice problem, and improve the understanding of the fluctuations in consumer demand. Finally, we propose a generalized price response function with standard properties applicable to E-Commerce.</description>

      <title>Weakly-Popular and Super-Popular Matchings with Ties and Their Connection to Stable Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a slightly different definition of popularity in bipartite graphs $G=(U,W,E)$ with two-sided preferences, when ties are present in the preference lists. This is motivated by the observation that if an agent $u$ is indifferent between his original partner $w$ in matching $M$ and his new partner $w'\ne w$ in matching $N$, then he may probably still prefer to stay with his original partner, as change requires effort, so he votes for $M$ in this case, instead of being indifferent.
  We show that this alternative definition of popularity, which we call weak-popularity allows us to guarantee the existence of such a matching and also to find a weakly-popular matching in polynomial-time that has size at least $\frac{3}{4}$ the size of the maximum weakly popular matching. We also show that this matching is at least $\frac{4}{5}$ times the size of the maximum (weakly) stable matching, so may provide a more desirable solution than the current best (and tight under certain assumptions) $\frac{2}{3}$-approximation for such a stable matching. We also show that unfortunately, finding a maximum size weakly popular matching is NP-hard, even with one-sided ties and that assuming some complexity theoretic assumptions, the $\frac{3}{4}$-approximation bound is tight.
  Then, we study a more general model than weak-popularity, where for each edge, we can specify independently for both endpoints the size of improvement the endpoint needs to vote in favor of a new matching $N$. We show that even in this more general model, a so-called $\gamma$-popular matching always exists and that the same positive results still hold.
  Finally, we define an other, stronger variant of popularity, called super-popularity, where even a weak improvement is enough to vote in favor of a new matching. We show that for this case, even the existence problem is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Truthful Aggregation of LLMs with an Application to Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online platforms generate hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue per year by showing advertisements alongside their own content. Currently, these platforms are integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into their services. This makes revenue generation from LLM-generated content the next major challenge in online advertising. We consider a scenario where advertisers aim to influence the responses of an LLM to align with their interests, while platforms seek to maximize advertiser value and ensure user satisfaction. We introduce an auction mechanism for this problem that operates without LLM fine-tuning or access to model weights and provably converges to the output of the optimally fine-tuned LLM for the platform's objective as computational resources increase. Our mechanism ensures that truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for advertisers and it aligns each advertiser's utility with their contribution to social welfare - an essential feature for long-term viability. Additionally, it can incorporate contextual information about the advertisers, significantly accelerating convergence. Via experiments with a publicly available LLM, we show that our mechanism significantly boosts advertiser value and platform revenue, with low computational overhead. While our motivating application is online advertising, our mechanism can be applied in any setting with monetary transfers, making it a general-purpose solution for truthfully aggregating the preferences of self-interested agents over LLM-generated replies.</description>

      <title>Contextual Dynamic Pricing with Strategic Buyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized pricing, which involves tailoring prices based on individual characteristics, is commonly used by firms to implement a consumer-specific pricing policy. In this process, buyers can also strategically manipulate their feature data to obtain a lower price, incurring certain manipulation costs. Such strategic behavior can hinder firms from maximizing their profits. In this paper, we study the contextual dynamic pricing problem with strategic buyers. The seller does not observe the buyer's true feature, but a manipulated feature according to buyers' strategic behavior. In addition, the seller does not observe the buyers' valuation of the product, but only a binary response indicating whether a sale happens or not. Recognizing these challenges, we propose a strategic dynamic pricing policy that incorporates the buyers' strategic behavior into the online learning to maximize the seller's cumulative revenue. We first prove that existing non-strategic pricing policies that neglect the buyers' strategic behavior result in a linear $\Omega(T)$ regret with $T$ the total time horizon, indicating that these policies are not better than a random pricing policy. We then establish that our proposed policy achieves a sublinear regret upper bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Importantly, our policy is not a mere amalgamation of existing dynamic pricing policies and strategic behavior handling algorithms. Our policy can also accommodate the scenario when the marginal cost of manipulation is unknown in advance. To account for it, we simultaneously estimate the valuation parameter and the cost parameter in the online pricing policy, which is shown to also achieve an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound. Extensive experiments support our theoretical developments and demonstrate the superior performance of our policy compared to other pricing policies that are unaware of the strategic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Individual and Collective Welfare in Risk Sharing with Many States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of a large (but finite) state space on models of efficient risk sharing. A group of risk-averse agents agree on a risk-sharing agreement in an economy without aggregate risk. The economy is subject to a perturbation, or shock, that prompts a renegotiation of the agreement. If agents insist on an $\ep$-utility improvement to accept a new agreement, then the probability of a post-shock acceptable agreement vanishes exponentially to zero as the number of states grows. We use similar arguments to consider a model where agents have multiple prior preferences, and show that the existence of an $\ep$-Pareto improving trade requires that some sets of priors have vanishingly small measure. Our results hinge on the "shape does not matter" message of high dimensional isoperimetric inequalities.</description>

      <title>Game theory of undirected graphical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $n$-player game $X$ in normal form can be modeled via undirected discrete graphical models where the discrete random variables represent the players and their state spaces are the set of pure strategies. There exists an edge between the vertices of the graphical model whenever there is a dependency between the associated players. We study the Spohn conditional independence (CI) variety $\mathcal{V}_{X,\mathcal{C}}$, which is the intersection of the independence model $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}}$ with the Spohn variety of the game $X$. We prove a conjecture by the first author and Sturmfels that $\mathcal{V}_{X,\mathcal{C}}$ is of codimension $n$ in $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}}$ for a generic game $X$ with binary choices. We show that the set of totally mixed CI equilibria i.e., the restriction of the Spohn CI variety to the open probability simplex is a smooth semialgebraic manifold for a generic game $X$ with binary choices. If the undirected graph is a disjoint union of cliques, we analyze certain algebro-geometric features of Spohn CI varieties and prove affine universality theorems.</description>
