      <title>Forbush Decreases during strong Geomagnetic Storms: Time Delays, Rigidity Effects, and ICME-Driven Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between Forbush decreases (FDs) and associated geomagnetic storms, and their links to interplanetary solar wind parameters, using high-resolution minute data. FDs are classified by main-phase decrease steps and analyzed with superposed epoch analysis. Fast, turbulent, high-field sheath structures occur before and during coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven FDs, whereas corotating interaction region events show delayed amplification and more perturbed dynamics. Time lags between FD and storm onsets are examined for space weather forecasting. FD amplitude correlates more strongly with moderate and strong CME-driven storms than with extreme storms, likely due to complex magnetospheric responses from successive events and prolonged southward IMF Bz. Events with fast shocks and sheath regions show stronger correlations than those without shocks. Energy dependence, derived from twelve neutron monitor stations worldwide, reveals a two-step linear rigidity spectrum: sharp FD amplitude decrease at low rigidity and a more gradual drop at higher rigidity.</description>

      <title>Foreground and internal free-free absorption in particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries : Insights from the radio emission of WR 147</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio emission from massive binary systems is generally of composite nature, showing both a thermal emission component from the winds and a non-thermal component from relativistic electrons accelerated in the colliding-wind region. Understanding the processes ruling their radio spectrum is essential to investigate the role of these objects in the production of non-thermal particle populations in our galaxy. Our objective is to explore how the processes at work in particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries (PACWBs) alter their spectral energy distribution, following a simple phenomenological description. We focus mainly on the role of free-free absorption (FFA) at low frequencies. Our intention is to use WR 147 as a test case, before tentatively extrapolating to a more generic behaviour. We processed recent Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array data, optimised for spectral analysis, combined with older measurements published in the literature at other frequencies. We analysed the radio spectrum considering both a more classical foreground free-free absorption (f-FFA) model and, for the first time, an internal free--free absorption (i-FFA) model. Our results show that the f-FFA model does not reproduce the spectral energy distribution of WR 147 at low frequencies. The i-FFA model is more efficient in providing a more complete description of the SED down to 610 MHz. This model is the only one to account for a change in the spectral index at low frequencies without any exponential drop in flux, as predicted by the f-FFA model. In addition, the upper limit at 150 MHz shows that two turnovers occur in the radio spectrum of WR 147, suggesting the effect of both i-FFA and f-FFA is seen in two regions of the spectrum.

      <title>An automated, self-calibration based pipeline for high-fidelity solar imaging with LOFAR: SIMPL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is capable of imaging spectroscopy of the Sun in the 10-240 MHz frequency range, with high spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution. However, the complex and rapidly varying nature of solar radio emission - spanning several orders of magnitude in brightness further exacerbated by the strong ionospheric phase distortions during daytime observations, poses major challenges for calibration, imaging, and automation. We aim to develop a fully automated, high-fidelity imaging pipeline optimized for LOFAR solar observations, capable of handling the intrinsic variability of solar emission and producing science-ready images with minimal human intervention. We have built the Solar Imaging Pipeline for LOFAR (SIMPL), which integrates excision of radio-frequency interference (RFI) for the solar-specific scenarios, calibration strategies, and self-calibration. The pipeline is designed to enable scalable and uniform processing of large archival datasets. SIMPL achieves more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in imaging dynamic range compared to previous efforts and reliably produces high-quality spectroscopic snapshot images. It has been tested across a wide range of solar conditions. It is currently being employed to process a decade of LOFAR solar observations, providing science-ready FITS images for the community and enabling both comprehensive and novel studies of solar radio phenomena -- ranging from quiet Sun emission and faint non-thermal features to active regions and their associated dynamic events, such as transient bursts.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection of Ellerman bombs in the H$\alpha$ line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ellerman bombs (EBs) are small and short-lived magnetic reconnection events in the lower solar atmosphere, most commonly reported in the line wings of the H$\alpha$ line. These events are thought to play a role in heating the solar chromosphere and corona, but their size, short lifetime, and similarity to other brightenings make them difficult to detect. We aim to automatically detect and statistically analyze EBs at different heliocentric angles to find trends in their physical properties. We developed an automated EB detection pipeline based on a star-finding algorithm. This pipeline was used on ten high-resolution H$\alpha$ datasets from the 1-meter Swedish Solar Telescope (SST). This pipeline identifies and tracks EBs in time, while separating them from visually similar pseudo-EBs. It returns key parameters such as size, contrast, lifetime, and occurrence rates based on a dynamic threshold and the more classical static `contrast threshold` of 1.5 times the mean quiet-Sun (QS) intensity. For our dynamic threshold, we found a total of 2257 EBs from 28,772 individual detections across our datasets. On average, the full detection set exhibits an area of 0.44 arcsec$^2$ (0.37 Mm$^2$), a peak intensity contrast of 1.4 relative to the QS, and a median lifetime of 2.3 min. ...</description>

      <title>Effects of light-mass fermionic dark matter on the equilibrium and stability of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) can be used as laboratories to test strong gravity and high-density regimes, once their equation of state is not so uncertain as the one of neutron stars. This makes them also a useful tool to constrain dark-matter models. In this work, we study dark matter white dwarfs (DMWD) composed of white dwarf matter admixed with fermionic dark matter in a two-fluid general relativistic framework. Dark matter particles are considered to have masses between $0.1-10$ GeV. The equilibrium configurations and stability are derived, showing that the DMWD can be more compact, with masses around 1.3 $M\odot$ and radii around 500 km. The increasing compactness leads to changes in the fundamental modes of radial oscillations ($\sim20\%$ for 0.1 GeV DM), which produce detectable shifts in GW frequencies. The interplay between dark matter and normal matter thus provides a compelling avenue for interpreting deviations in observed WD properties and for placing constraints on DM characteristics through astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Can stellar physics explain GW231123?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17} M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52} M_\odot $ -- well within or above the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160 \rm M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing a significant ingredient that correlates masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap, implying that stellar evolution alone is sufficient to explain GW231123. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.</description>

      <title>Pinched Magnetic Fields in the High-mass Protocluster W3 IRS5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present polarization maps of dust emission at 340 GHz in the luminous high-mass protocluster, W3 IRS5, observed with the Submillimeter Array. The projected magnetic fields appear fairly organized with a pinched morphology in the northern part and a concave shape in the southern part. We fit the polarization maps with a two-component magnetic field model: an hourglass model centered at the continuum peak, SMM2, and an empirical sphere centered at the O-type star, IRS7. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we calculate a projected field strength of $B_\mathrm{pos} = 1.4 \; \mathrm{mG}$. Along with the Zeeman measurement, a total magnetic field strength of $B_\mathrm{tot} = 1.6 \; \mathrm{mG}$ is obtained. We find that the gravitational energy is the most dominant, followed by magnetic energy, and then turbulent energy. Small values of the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir} = 0.8$, and the ratio of timescales, $t_\mathrm{ff}/t_\mathrm{corss} = 0.6$, suggest an ongoing collapse. We also show collimated molecular outflows in the $\mathrm{CO \; (3-2)}$ and $\mathrm{SiO \; (8-7)}$ transitions. The morphology of magnetic fields and the surrounding \HII regions put forward a scenario for W3 IRS5. A gravitationally unstable dense core formed within a neutral gas ridge plowed by the expansions of W3 A and W3 B. The core began to contract, causing gravity to pull the magnetic field lines inward, which resulted in a pinched field morphology. Subsequent expansion of W3 F, ionized by IRS7, perturbed the magnetic field, creating concave patterns. The dynamical interactions among protostars led to misalignment of their outflows.</description>

      <title>Cosmic cascades: How disk substructure regulates the flow of water to inner planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influx of icy pebbles to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks constitutes a fundamental ingredient in most planet formation theories. The observational determination of the magnitude of this pebble flux and its dependence on disk substructure (disk gaps as pebble traps) would be a significant step forward. In this work we analyze a sample of 21 T Tauri disks (with ages $\approx 0.5{-}2\mathrm{~Myr}$) using JWST/MIRI spectra homogeneously reduced with the JDISCS pipeline and high-angular-resolution ALMA continuum data. We find that the 1500/6000 K water line flux ratio measured with JWST - a tracer of cold water vapor and pebble drift near the snowline - correlates with the radial location of the innermost dust gap in ALMA continuum observations (ranging from 8.7 to 69 au), confirming predictions from recent models that study connections between the inner and outer disk reservoirs. We develop a population synthesis exploration of pebble drift in gapped disks and find a good match to the observed trend for early and relatively effective gaps, while scenarios where pebble drift happens quickly, gaps are very leaky, or where gaps form late are disfavored on a population level. Inferred snowline pebble mass fluxes (ranging between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-3}~M_\oplus/\mathrm{yr}$ depending on gap position) are comparable to fluxes used in pebble accretion studies and those proposed for the inner Solar System, while system-to-system variations suggest differences in the emerging planetary system architectures and water budgets.</description>

      <title>Arecibo Wow! II: Revised Properties of the Wow! Signal from Archival Ohio SETI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wow! Signal, detected in 1977 by the Ohio State University SETI project, remains one of the most intriguing unexplained radio transients. The most recent significant revision of its properties took place in the late 1990s; however, further advances were limited by readily available data from this event. Here we retrieved and analyzed decades of previously unpublished Ohio SETI observations, enabling the most comprehensive re-evaluation of the properties of the Wow! Signal to date with modern methods. Our results reveal significant revisions to its parameters that may help explain why its source has been so difficult to identify. We refine its potential origin to two adjacent fields centered on the right ascension $\alpha=19^{\mathrm h}25^{\mathrm m}02^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$ or $19^{\mathrm h}27^{\mathrm m}55^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$, and the declination $\delta=-26^{\deg}57' \pm 20'$ (J2000), a location both narrower and slightly displaced from earlier estimates. We measure a higher peak flux density exceeding 250 Jy and a frequency of $1420.726 \pm 0.005$ MHz, implying a galactic source with a substantially higher radial velocity than previously assumed. Our analysis provides additional support for the hypothesis that the Wow! Signal most likely had an astrophysical origin rather than being attributed to radio interference. In particular, we confirm that small, cold HI clouds can produce narrowband signals similar to its detection, which might suggest a common origin. These findings provide the most precise constraints to date on the location, intensity, and frequency of the Wow! Signal and offer a new path to identify its origin.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic approaches to rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega $ within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\cal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R &lt;&lt; 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum at small frequencies $\omega$ is specified for calculations of the adiabatic moment of inertia (MI) within the Kerr metric coordinate approach in the outer Boyer-Lindquist and inner Hogan forms. The NS MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\cal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal-angle correlation, $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sums of the volume and surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of strong gravitation and surface effects. We found the significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius due to the correlation term $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$. With this term, the adiabaticity condition fails for the NS J0740+6620, with the mass about $M_\odot$ for a strong gravitation, in contrast to the NS J0030+0451 for smaller mass, and many other NSs.</description>

      <title>Signature of the explosion mechanism of Type-Ia SNe in substructures of the remnant: the case of Tycho's SNR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type-Ia supernovae (SNe), or runaway thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (WDs), play a critical role in the chemical evolution of galaxies, and are important cosmological distance indicators due to their 'standardizable' lightcurves. Growing evidence, however, suggests greater diversity in their observed lightcurves (and spectra) than thought previously. This is usually attributed to a variety of WD explosion mechanisms and progenitor system properties, but a direct link between the explosion mechanisms and Type-Ia SN observables remains elusive. Here we present a novel approach to identify explosion mechanisms of Type-Ia SNe, by analyzing the sizes of small-scale turbulent substructures of different elements in their extended ejecta, i.e., in Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Our three-dimensional hydrodynamical models show that substructures in an SNR dominated by iron-group elements may have a typical size different from substructures dominated by intermediate mass elements (e.g., Si, S) in the same SNR. This size difference is governed by the explosion mechanism. Applying this approach to Tycho's SNR, we find that its observed structure is most consistent with the explosion of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD via the double-detonation mechanism. Extending this method to other well-characterized SNRs can let us connect the inferred explosion mechanism to the associated historical SNe, which often have spectra reconstructed through light echo observations.</description>

      <title>Heartbeat Stars Recognition Based on Recurrent Neural Networks: Method and Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the variety of their light curve morphologies, the vast majority of the known heartbeat stars (HBSs) have been discovered by manual inspection. Machine learning, which has already been successfully applied to the classification of variable stars based on light curves, offers another possibility for the automatic detection of HBSs. We propose a novel feature extraction approach for HBSs. First, the orbital frequencies are calculated automatically according to the Fourier spectra of the light curves. Then, the amplitudes of the first 100 harmonics are extracted. Finally, these harmonics are normalized as feature vectors of the light curve. A training data set of synthetic light curves is constructed using ELLC, and their features are fed into recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for supervised learning, with the expected output being the eccentricity of these light curves. The performance of the RNNs is evaluated using a test data set of synthetic light curves, achieving 95$\%$ accuracy. When applied to known HBSs from the OGLE, Kepler, and TESS surveys, the networks achieve an average accuracy of 86$\%$. This method successfully identifies four new HBSs within the eclipsing binary catalog of Kirk et al. The use of orbital harmonics as features for HBSs proves to be a practical approach that significantly reduces the computational cost of neural networks. RNNs show excellent performance in recognizing this type of time series data. This method not only allows efficient identification of HBSs but can also be extended to recognize other types of periodic variable stars.</description>

      <title>DAmodel: Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling of DA White Dwarfs for Spectrophotometric Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards ($16.5 &lt; V &lt; 19.5$) alongside three CALSPEC standards, from 912 \r{A} to 32 $\mu$m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (surface gravity $\log g$, effective temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$, extinction $A_V$, dust relation parameter $R_V$) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) UVIS and IR photometry, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding $&lt;0.004$ mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred spectral energy distributions from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VIII. The impact of external photoevaporation on disk masses and radii in Upper Scorpius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disk evolution can be deeply influenced by the UV radiation emitted by neighboring massive stars (mainly of spectral type O and B). We show that the process of external photoevaporation, which causes an outside-in depletion of disk material due to environmental UV radiation, can lead to a significant decrease in disk size, and moderate in disk mass and lifetime even at moderate irradiation levels (1-10 G$_{0}$). In this work we investigate the role of external photoevaporation in shaping the masses and sizes of the ten AGE-PRO disks in the Upper Scorpius region, which we estimate to be subject to FUV fluxes ranging between 2 and 12 G$_{0}$, on average. We compare the disk masses and sizes resulting from 1D numerical viscous evolution simulations in which the effect of external photoevaporation is included, to the values retrieved from the AGE-PRO observations. While the pure viscous framework fails in adequately explaining the observed disk properties in Upper Scorpius, with the inclusion of external photoevaporation we can successfully reproduce gas disk sizes for 7 out of 10 sources within a factor &lt;2, when the initial disk mass is 1-10% of the stellar mass. We emphasize the importance of accounting for the environmental irradiation when comparing star-forming regions of different ages, even when moderate FUV irradiation fields are experienced, as in the case of Upper Scorpius.</description>

      <title>Metal-polluted Population III galaxies and How to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observing Population III (hereafter PopIII) galaxies, the hosts of first-generation stars, remains challenging even with the JWST. The current few candidates have been identified through the combination of a prominent HeII emission and the absence of metal lines, a well-known but extremely brief signature of metal-free systems. Here, we accurately model the evolution of the emission from PopIII galaxies to increase the number of candidates in JWST observations. To achieve this, we employ a locally calibrated galaxy-formation model that self-consistently follows the star formation and chemical evolution initiated by the first stars. We find that PopIII galaxies can emit metal lines in their ``self-polluted'' phase, while galaxies host only metal-free stars but the gas has been chemically-enriched by the first supernovae. In this phase, PopIII galaxies have $\rm [OIII]/H\beta \approx 1$, which opens the pool of candidates to more easily detectable sources. We predict that the high HeII emission of PopIII galaxies can last up to $\rm \approx 20 \, Myrs$ and that it is partly maintained in the ``hybrid'' phase, when PopIII and PopII stars co-exist in the host galaxy. We propose novel diagnostics involving UV metal lines to select PopIII candidates in high-z JWST surveys. In JADES, we identify 9 candidate galaxies with $&gt;25\%$ of their stellar mass in metal-free stars, showcasing the effectiveness of our method. Ultimately, the key to discovering PopIII galaxies could be to catch them during their first episodes of chemical enrichment.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOgee Survey VIII. Final ASPCAP results for all clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bulge globular clusters(BGCs) are exceptional tracers of the formation and chemodynamical evolution of this oldest Galactic component. However, until now, observational difficulties have prevented us from taking full advantage of these powerful Galactic archeological tools. CAPOS, the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey, addresses this key topic by observing a large number of BGCs, most of which have been poorly studied. We aim to obtain accurate mean values for metallicity,[alpha/Fe],and radial velocity, as well as abundances for 11 other elements. We present final parameters based on ASPCAP for all 18 CAPOS BGCs. We carry out a stringent membership selection, finding 303 with SNR&gt;70 and 125 with lower SNR. We reinforced the finding that stars with high [N/Fe] abundances show higher [Fe/H] than their lower [N/Fe] counterparts. Mg,Ca and global alpha abundances show similar trends, while Si is well-behaved. The [Fe/H] value of these 2nd population stars is corrected to derive the mean metallicity. Mean metallicities are determined to a precision of 0.05 dex,[alpha/Fe] to 0.06 dex, and radial velocity to 3.4 km/s. No clusters show strong evidence for internal metallicity variation, including M22. Abundances for 11 other elements using only 1st population stars are calculated and are generally in good agreement with the literature. We develope a new chemodynamical GC classification scheme, synthesizing several recent studies. We also compile up-to-date metallicities. The BGC metallicity distribution is bimodal, with peaks at [Fe/H]=-0.45 and -1.1, with the metal-poor peak strongly dominant, while exsitu GCs are unimodal, with a peak at -1.6. Surprisingly, we find only a small, statistically insignificant difference in the mean [Si/Fe] of in and exsitu GCs. The 4 GCs with the lowest [Si/Fe] values are all exsitu, relatively young, and 3 belong to Sagittarius, but no other correlations are evident.</description>
