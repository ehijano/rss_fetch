      <title>Boson peak as a phenomenon participated by the vast majority of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the excess vibrational density of states (DOS) beyond Debye's theory in amorphous solids (often referred to as the Boson peak) has been attributed to the presence of quasi-localized vibrational modes in recent years. However, by dispersing the total DOS onto each degree of freedom (DOF), the results of this report provide evidence that \(99.9\%\) of DOFs, and hence almost all particles, contribute to the Boson peak (BP). These results challenge the prevailing opinion that BP is contributed by a minority of particles and highlight its long-neglected global and collective origin.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{R}$-transforms for Non-Hermitian Matrices: A Spherical Integral Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a connection between the formalism of $\mathcal{R}$-transforms for non-Hermitian random matrices and the framework of spherical integrals, using the replica method. This connection was previously proved in the Hermitian setting and in the case of bi-invariant random matrices. We show that the $\mathcal{R}$-transforms used in the non-Hermitian context in fact originate from a single scalar function of two variables. This provides a new and transparent way to compute $\mathcal{R}$-transforms, which until now had been known only in restricted cases such as bi-invariant, Hermitian, or elliptic ensembles.</description>

      <title>Facets of Many Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) appears to be a robust example of ergodicity breaking in many-body interacting systems. Here, we review different aspects of MBL, concentrating on various ways the disorder may be introduced into the system studied. In particular, we consider both the random and quasiperiodic diagonal (i.e., on-site) disorder as well as bond disorder as realized in randomly distributed atoms interacting via long-range interactions. We also review the quantum sun model, which seems to be the ideal, albeit artificial, model exhibiting MBL.</description>

      <title>Charge Transport and Multiplication in Lateral Amorphous Selenium Devices Under Cryogenic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic photon sensing for high-energy physics motivates photosensor technologies that combine large-area scalability with internal gain and stable operation at low temperature. Amorphous selenium is a promising photoconductor, yet its field- and temperature-dependent transport and avalanche response in lateral geometries have not been systematically established. This work reports field-resolved photocurrent measurements of lateral a-Se devices from 93 K to 297 K under 401 nm excitation at fields up to 120 V/um. Below avalanche onset, the external quantum efficiency was described by the Onsager model, yielding effective post-thermalization separations that decrease with decreasing temperature. The field-assisted detrapping region was evaluated using several transport models, with the data favoring field-assisted hopping and thermally-assisted tunneling as the mechanisms that best capture the temperature evolution of the photocurrent. The boundaries between field-assisted detrapping, transport-limited conduction, and avalanche shift with temperature; at 93 K the response transitions directly from detrapping into avalanche. Avalanche multiplication was analyzed using the Lucky-drift model. These results provide the first systematic characterization of cryogenic avalanche behavior in lateral a-Se detectors and establish quantitative trends relevant to low-temperature, high-gain photodetector design.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Computers for MIMO Detection: From Sparsification to 2D Parallel Tempering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic computers built from p-bits offer a promising path for combinatorial optimization, but the dense connectivity required by real-world problems scales poorly in hardware. Here, we address this through graph sparsification with auxiliary copy variables and demonstrate a fully on-chip parallel tempering solver on an FPGA. Targeting MIMO detection, a dense, NP-hard problem central to wireless communications, we fit 15 temperature replicas of a 128-node sparsified system (1,920 p-bits) entirely on-chip and achieve bit error rates significantly below conventional linear detectors. We report complete end-to-end solution times of 4.7 ms per instance, with all loading, sampling, readout, and verification overheads included. ASIC projections in 7 nm technology indicate about 90 MHz operation with less than 200 mW power dissipation, suggesting that massive parallelism across multiple chips could approach the throughput demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, sparsification introduces sensitivity to the copy-constraint strength. Employing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering (2D-PT), which exchanges replicas across both temperature and constraint dimensions, we demonstrate over 10X faster convergence without manual parameter tuning. These results establish an on-chip p-bit architecture and a scalable algorithmic framework for dense combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Controlling thermal conductivity in harmonic chains with correlated mass and bond disorder: Analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate heat transport in one-dimensional harmonic chains with mass disorder and weak bond disorder, coupled at both ends to oscillator heat baths through weak impedance mismatches. The model incorporates correlations in mass disorder, in bond disorder, and between the two. We find that the scaling of thermal conductivity $\kappa$ with system size $N$ is determined solely by either mass disorder or bond disorder. This indicates that cross-correlations between the two types of disorder play no important role in the scaling behavior of $\kappa$. Consequently, by tuning the self-correlations, it is possible to control how the thermal conductivity scales with the system size. Such control could have potential applications in thermoelectric devices and thermal insulation technologies.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium DC Current Generation in a Driven Dissipative Haldane Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of topology with nonequilibrium driving and dissipation in open quantum systems has recently attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate a driven, dissipative Haldane model using large-scale numerical simulations of Lindblad dynamics. We show that the system evolves into a time-periodic quasi-steady state when subjected to driving and dissipation, with the ground-state topological invariant, the Chern number, no longer being quantized. Nevertheless, remnants of the underlying band topology persist in this state. To quantify this regime, we introduce an occupation-weighted Chern number that captures the topology of this nonequilibrium steady state. We further analyze charge transport in the presence of simultaneous driving and damping and demonstrate that a finite DC bulk current emerges when inversion symmetry is broken by a staggered sublattice potential. The magnitude and direction of this current are controlled by the driving amplitude, revealing a tunable nonequilibrium transport response rooted in broken symmetries and residual topology.</description>

      <title>Learning About Learning: A Physics Path from Spin Glasses to Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>DDNet: A Unified Physics-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Semiconductor Device Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of semiconductor devices plays a critical role in the development of new technology nodes and next-generation devices. Semiconductor device designers largely rely on advanced simulation software to solve the drift-diffusion equations, a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe carrier transport in semiconductor devices. While these tools perform well for forward modeling, they are not suitable to address inverse problems, for example, determining doping profiles, material, and geometrical parameters given a desired device performance. Meanwhile, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have grown in popularity in recent years thanks to their ability to efficiently and accurately solve inverse problems at minimal computational cost compared to forward problems. In this study, we introduce the Drift-Diffusion Network (DDNet), a unified physics-informed deep learning solver for the forward and inverse mesh-free solutions of the drift-diffusion equations of semiconductor device modeling. Using prototypical device configurations in one- and two spatial dimensions, we show that DDNet achieves low absolute and relative error compared to traditional simulation software while additionally solving user-defined inverse problems with minimal computational overhead. We expect that DDNet will benefit semiconductor device modeling by facilitating exploration and discovery of novel device structures across comprehensive parameter sets in a fully automated way.</description>

      <title>Exact Relation Between Wehrl-R\'enyi Entropy and Many-Body Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is key to understanding correlations and emergent phenomena in quantum many-body systems. For $N$ qubits (distinguishable spin-$1/2$ particles) in a pure quantum state, many-body entanglement can be characterized by the purity of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem, defined as the trace of the square of this reduced density matrix. Nevertheless, this approach depends on the choice of subsystem. In this letter, we establish an exact relation between the Wehrl-R\'enyi entropy (WRE) $S_W^{(2)}$, which is the 2nd R\'enyi entropy of the Husimi function of the entire system, and the purities of all possible subsystems. Specifically, we prove the relation $e^{-S_W^{(2)}} = (6\pi)^{-N} \sum_A \mathrm{Tr}({{\hat \rho}_A}^2)$, where $A$ denotes a subsystem with reduced density matrix ${\hat \rho}_A$, and the summation runs over all $2^N$ possible subsystems. Furthermore, we show that the WRE can be experimentally measured via a concrete scheme. Therefore, the WRE is a subsystem-independent and experimentally measurable characterization of the overall entanglement in pure states of $N$ qubits. It can be applied to the study of strongly correlated spin systems, particularly those with all-to-all couplings that do not have a natural subsystem division, such as systems realized with natural atoms in optical tweezer arrays or superconducting quantum circuits. We also analytically derive the WRE for several representative many-body states, including Haar-random states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the W state.</description>
