      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Hybrid Continuous-Discrete Ground-State Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for a hybrid continuous-discrete algorithm that integrates continuous-time deterministic dynamics with Metropolis-Hastings steps to combine search dynamics with and without detailed balance. Our purpose is to study the non-equilibrium dynamics that leads to the ground state of rugged energy landscapes in this general setting. Our results show that MH-driven dynamics reach ``easy'' ground states faster, indicating a stronger bias in the non-equilibrium dynamics of the algorithm with reversible transition probabilities. To validate this, we construct a set of Ising problem instances with a controllable bias in the energy landscape that makes one degenerate solution more accessible than another. The constructed hybrid algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in convergence and ground-state sampling accuracy, achieving a 100x speedup on GPUs compared to simulated annealing, making it well-suited for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Improving the mean-field approximation in continuous models of population dynamics with nonlocal dispersal: applications to vegetation pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spot patterns, in which vegetation patches form a hexagonal lattice, are frequent in nature and could serve as an early-warning indicator of abrupt vegetation collapses. Consequently, they have been intensively studied using both individual-based models and density-based field equations. Yet, the relationship between these two approaches remains unclear, particularly in scenarios where vegetation dynamics exhibit strong long-range spatial correlations and traditional mean-field approximations fail. To solve this issue, we develop a new method that refines mean-field approximations by describing both the dynamics of the biomass density field and its spatial correlations. This new approach harnesses the strengths of both individual and density-based mdoels, treating spatial correlations explicitly and allowing for the identification of spatial instabilities resulting in periodic patterns. Our results indicate that this new approximation predicts the parameter regimes where regular periodic patterns emerge more accurately than mean-field models, suggesting that it could provide a more robust framework to perform further nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>A simple intelligent adaptive network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For real-world complex system constantly enduring perturbation, to achieve survival goal in changing yet unknown environments, the central problem is constantly adapting themself to external environments according to environmental feedback. Such adaptability is considered the nature of general intelligence. Inspired by thermodynamics, we develop a self-adaptive network utilizing only macroscopic information to achieve desired landscape through reconfiguring itself in unknown environments. By continuously estimating environment entropy, our network can adaptively realize desired landscape represented by topological measures. Our network achieves adaptation under several scenarios, including confinement on phase space and geographic constraint. A unique power law distinguishes our network from memoryless systems. Furthermore, our simple strategy could enable brain network and communication network to adaptively maintain essential topological characteristics. Compared to data-driven methods, our self-adaptive network is understandable without careful choice of learning architectures and parameters. Our self-adaptive network could help to understand adaptive intelligence through the lens of thermodynamics.</description>
