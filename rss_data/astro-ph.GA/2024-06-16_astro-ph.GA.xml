      <title>Bar formation and evolution in the cosmological context: Inputs from the Auriga simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic bars drive the internal evolution of spiral galaxies, while their formation is tightly coupled to the properties of their host galaxy and dark matter halo. To explore what drives bar formation in the cosmological context and how these structures evolve throughout cosmic history, we use the Auriga suite of magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations. We find that bars are robust and long-lived structures, and we recover a decreasing bar fraction with increasing redshift which plateaus around $\sim20\%$ at $z\sim3$. We find that bars which form at low and intermediate redshifts grow longer with time, while bars that form at high redshifts are born `saturated' in length, likely due to their merger-induced formation pathway. This leads to a larger bar-to-disc size ratio at high redshifts as compared to the local Universe. We subsequently examine the multi-dimensional parameter space thought to drive bar formation. We find that barred galaxies tend to have lower Toomre $Q$ values at the time of their formation, while we do not find a difference in the gas fraction of barred and unbarred populations when controlling for stellar mass. Barred galaxies tend to be more baryon-dominated at all redshifts, assembling their stellar mass earlier, while galaxies that are baryon-dominated but that do not host a bar, have a higher ex-situ bulge fraction. We explore the implications of the baryon-dominance of barred galaxies on the Tully-Fisher relation, finding an offset from the unbarred relation; confirming this in observations would serve as additional evidence for dark matter, as this behaviour is not readily explained in modified gravity scenarios.</description>

      <title>Emergence of red, star-forming galaxies (red misfits) in a {\Lambda}CDM universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of red misfits (RM) using a cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation from the $\rm \small EAGLE$ project. Similar to observations, the RM possess less dust, higher stellar metallicities, and older stellar populations compared to blue, star-forming galaxies (BA) at the same $M_\star$. Lagrangian particle-tracking reveals that the older ages of RM have resulted from a combined effect of higher star formation efficiency (SFE), and the earlier onset and faster net depletion of their interstellar medium (ISM). For the centrals, the latter was partially due to higher efficiency of escape from ISM, driven by stronger stellar and/or AGN feedback (depending on the mass). There was an additional contribution to this escape from gas stripping for satellite RM, as suggested by the higher group masses ($\gtrsim 0.5$ dex) and ${\rm H_2}/{\rm H\,{\small I}}$ ratios ($\gtrsim 0.3$ dex). Moreover, accretion of circumgalactic gas (CGM) onto the galaxy has been less efficient for the satellites. On the metallicity front, the offsets are largely due to the disparity in SFE, causing varying degrees of enrichment through the mass-transfers associated with stellar winds and supernovae. We ascribe this SFE disparity to the lower specific angular momentum ($j$) of freshly accreted CGM for RM, which ultimately manifested in the ISM kinematics due to interactions with cooling flows. The impact on $j_{\rm ism}$ was further intensified by poorer alignment with the flow's $\vec{j}$, particularly for the satellites. Our results illuminate potential origins of RM, and motivate further exploration of this peculiar class through a synergy between observations and simulations.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas excitation in the circumgalactic medium of MACS1931-26</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of galaxies is largely affected by exchanging material with their close environment, the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this work, we investigate the CGM and the interstellar medium (ISM) of the bright central galaxy (BCG) of the galaxy cluster, MACS1931-26 at z~0.35. We detected [CI](2-1), CO(1-0), and CO(7-6) emission lines with the APEX 12-m and NRO 45-m telescopes. We complemented these single-dish observations with CO(1-0), CO(3-2), and CO(4-3) ALMA interferometric data and inferred the cold molecular hydrogen physical properties. Using a modified large velocity gradient (LVG) model, we modelled the CO and CI emission of the CGM and BCG to extract the gas thermodynamical properties, including the kinetic temperature, the density, and the virialisation factor. Our study shows that the gas in the BCG is highly excited, comparable to the gas in local ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), while the CGM is likely less excited, colder, less dense, and less bound compared to the ISM of the BCG. The molecular hydrogen mass of the whole system derived using [CI](2-1) is larger than the mass derived from CO(1-0) in literature, showing that part of the gas in this system is CO-poor. Additional spatially resolved CI observations in both transitions, CO(1-0) and [CI](2-1), and the completion of the CO SLED with higher CO transitions are crucial to trace the different phases of the gas in such systems and constrain their properties.</description>

      <title>Dust-Evacuated Zones Near Massive Stars: Consequences of Dust Dynamics on Star-forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars form within dense cores composed of both gas and dust within molecular clouds. However, despite the crucial role that dust plays in the star formation process, its dynamics is frequently overlooked, with the common assumption being a constant, spatially uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size spectrum. In this study, we introduce a set of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star forming molecular clouds from the {\small STARFORGE} project. These simulations expand upon the earlier radiation MHD models, which included cooling, individual star formation, and feedback. Notably, they explicitly address the dynamics of dust grains, considering radiation, drag, and Lorentz forces acting on a diverse size spectrum of live dust grains. We find that interactions between radiation and dust significantly influence the properties of gas surrounding and accreting onto massive stars. Specifically, we find that once stars exceed a certain mass threshold ($\sim 2 M_{\odot}$), their emitted radiation can evacuate dust grains from their vicinity, giving rise to a dust-suppressed zone of size $\sim 100$ AU. Commencing during the early accretion stages and preceding the Main-sequence phase, this process results in a mass-dependent depletion in the accreted dust-to-gas (ADG) mass ratio within both the circumstellar disc and the star. We predict massive stars ($\gtrsim 10 M_{\odot}$) would exhibit ADG ratios that are approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of their parent clouds. Consequently, stars, their discs, and circumstellar environments would display notable deviations in the abundances of elements commonly associated with dust grains, such as carbon and oxygen.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Nitrogen Isotope Ratios: Measurements on tracers of C$^{14}$N and C$^{15}$N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen isotope ratio 14N/15N is a powerful tool to trace Galactic stellar nucleosynthesis and constraining Galactic chemical evolution. Previous observations have found lower 14N/15N ratios in the Galactic center and higher values in the Galactic disk. This is consistent with the inside-out formation scenario of our Milky Way. However, previous studies mostly utilized double isotope ratios also including 12C/13C, which introduces additional uncertainties. Here we therefore present observations of C14N and its rare isotopologue, C15N, toward a sample of star forming regions, measured by the IRAM 30 m and/or the ARO 12 m telescope at $\lambda$ ~3 mm wavelength. For those 35 sources detected in both isotopologues, physical parameters are determined. Furthermore we have obtained nitrogen isotope ratios using the strongest hyperfine components of CN and C15N. For those sources showing small deviations from Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium and/or self-absorption, the weakest hyperfine component, likely free of the latter effect, was used to obtain reliable 14N/15N values. Our measured 14N/15N isotope ratios from C14N and C15N measurements are compatible with those from our earlier measurements of NH3 and 15NH3 (Paper I), i.e., increasing ratios to a Galacticentric distance of ~9 kpc. The unweighted second order polynomial fit yields $\frac{{\rm C^{14}N}}{{\rm C^{15}N}} = (-4.85 \pm 1.89)\;{\rm kpc^{-2}} \times R_{\rm GC}^{2} + (82.11 \pm 31.93) \;{\rm kpc^{-1}} \times R_{\rm GC} - (28.12 \pm 126.62)$. Toward the outer galaxy, the isotope ratio tends to decrease, supporting an earlier finding by H13CN/HC15N. Galactic chemical evolution models are consistent with our measurements of the 14N/15N isotope ratio, i.e. a rising trend from the Galactic center region to approximately 9 kpc, followed by a decreasing trend with increasing $R_{\rm GC}$ toward the outer Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Indefinitely Flat Circular Velocities and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation from Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a new deprojection formula to infer the gravitational potential around isolated galaxies from weak gravitational lensing. The results imply circular velocity curves that remain flat for hundreds of kpc, greatly extending the classic result from 21 cm observations. Indeed, there is no clear hint of a decline out to 1 Mpc, well beyond the expected virial radii of dark matter halos. Binning the data by mass reveals a correlation with the flat circular speed that closely agrees with the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation known from kinematic data. These results apply to both early and late type galaxies, indicating a common universal behavior.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU): Observations of Filamentary Structures in the Abell S1136 Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present radio observations of the galaxy cluster Abell S1136 at 888 MHz, using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder radio telescope, as part of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe Early Science program. We compare these findings with data from the Murchison Widefield Array, XMM-Newton, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the Digitised Sky Survey, and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Our analysis shows the X-ray and radio emission in Abell S1136 are closely aligned and centered on the BCG, while the X-ray temperature profile shows a relaxed cluster with no evidence of a cool core. We find that the diffuse radio emission in the centre of the cluster shows more structure than seen in previous low-resolution observations of this source, which appeared formerly as an amorphous radio blob, similar in appearance to a radio halo; our observations show the diffuse emission in the Abell S1136 galaxy cluster contains three narrow filamentary structures visible at 888 MHz, between$\sim 80$ and 140 kpc in length; however the properties of the diffuse emission do not fully match that of a radio (mini-)halo or (fossil) tailed radio source.</description>

      <title>ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey: Physical characterization of near-infrared-dark intrinsically faint ALMA sources at z=2-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) spectral line-scan observations at 3-mm and 2-mm bands of three near-infrared-dark (NIR-dark) galaxies behind two massive lensing clusters MACS J0417.5-1154 and RXC J0032.1+1808. Each of these three sources is a faint (de-lensed $S_{\text{1.2 mm}}$ $&lt;$ 1 mJy) triply lensed system originally discovered in the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey. We have successfully detected CO and [C I] emission lines and confirmed that their spectroscopic redshifts are $z=3.652$, 2.391, and 2.985. By utilizing a rich multi-wavelength data set, we find that the NIR-dark galaxies are located on the star formation main sequence in the intrinsic stellar mass range of log ($M_*$/$M_\odot$) = 9.8 - 10.4, which is about one order of magnitude lower than that of typical submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). These NIR-dark galaxies show a variety in gas depletion times and spatial extent of dust emission. One of the three is a normal star-forming galaxy with gas depletion time consistent with a scaling relation, and its infrared surface brightness is an order of magnitude smaller than that of typical SMGs. Since this galaxy has an elongated axis ratio of $\sim 0.17$, we argue that normal star-forming galaxies in an edge-on configuration can be heavily dust-obscured. This implies that existing deep WFC3/F160W surveys may miss a fraction of typical star-forming main-sequence galaxies due to their edge-on orientation.</description>

      <title>Metallicity relations in LMC and SMC from the slope of Red Giant Branch stars in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red giants are an excellent tool for probing the history of star formation and subsequent metallicity evolution in the galaxies. The well-defined red giant branch (RGB) stars of the globular clusters can be used to determine their slopes and to calibrate the RGB slope parameters, age, and metallicity relations. We obtained deep near-IR $JHK$ stellar photometry of 23 LMC/SMC globular clusters. The cluster sample covers a wide range in metallicities $(-1.76&lt;{\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;-0.32)$ and ages $(0.6\,{\rm Gyr}&lt;t&lt;14\,{\rm Gyr})$. The slope of the RGBs of each cluster was calculated and used to derive the relations between slope-age-metallicity. We have found that the RGB slope do not shows any statistically significant age dependence. The young and old clusters are found to be distributed differently in RGB slope-metallicity space, and the younger populations show a slightly less steep RGB slope dependence than the whole cluster sample. The population of the younger clusters shows a negative slope, whereas the older clusters show a positive slope.</description>

      <title>Candidate Young Stellar Objects in the S-cluster: The Kinematic Analysis of a Sub-population of the Low-mass G-objects close to Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of several L-band emission sources in the S cluster has led to a rich discussion of their nature. However, a definitive answer to the classification of the dusty objects requires an explanation for the detection of compact Doppler-shifted Br$\gamma$ emission. The ionized hydrogen in combination with the observation of mid-infrared $L$-band continuum emission suggests that most of these sources are embedded in a dusty envelope. These embedded sources are part of the S-cluster, and their relationship to the S-stars is still under debate. Until now, the question of the origin of these two populations is vague, although all explanations favor migration processes for the individual cluster members.
  This work revisits the S-cluster and its dusty members orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr~A* on bound Keplerian orbits from a kinematic perspective. The aim is to explore the Keplerian parameters for patterns that might imply a non-random distribution of the sample. Additionally, various analytical aspects are considered to address the nature of the dusty sources. Based on the photometric analysis, we estimated the individual $H-K$ and $K-L$ colors for the source sample and compared the results to known cluster members. The classification revealed a noticeable contrast between the S-stars and the dusty sources. To fit the flux-density distribution, we utilized the radiative transfer code HYPERION and implemented a Young Stellar Object Class I model. We obtained the position angle from the Keplerian fit results, and additionally, we analyzed the distribution of the inclinations and the longitudes of the ascending node. The colors of the dusty sources suggest a stellar nature consistent with the spectral energy distribution in the near and mid-infrared domains.</description>

      <title>Subhalos are Distributed Anisotropically About Their Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distributions of subhalos about their hosts in two suites of zoom-in N-body simulations of halo growth -- one suite focused on Milky Way Mass halos ($\sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and another focused on cluster ($\sim 10^{15} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) halos in the Symphony simulation suite. We find, in agreement with previous work on this subject, that subhalos are distributed anisotropically about their host halos. In particular, the positions of subhalos lie preferentially near the major axes of their host halos, possibly implying that satellite galaxies will exhibit a similar alignment. Furthermore, we show that in two-dimensional projection subhalos are more likely to be observed near the halo center (where the central galaxy presumably resides) when the host halo is projected nearly along its major axis. This projection effect is significant. Within a projected radius of $5\%$ of the virial radius of the host halo, the fraction of mass in subhalos is $\sim 44\%$ larger for Milky Way mass halos and as much as $\sim 145\%$ larger for cluster halos when projected along the major axis as compared to the average from a random projection. This result has consequences for many applications including the interpretation of gravitational lenses. Finally, we find that the orbital angular momentum vector of subhalos is aligned with the angular momentum vector of their host halo, indicating that a significant component of a halo's angular momentum may be carried in its subhalos. This has consequences for galaxy formation models which use host halo angular momentum as a proxy for galaxy momentum.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Predictors of LyC Escape I: A Survival Analysis of the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand how galaxies reionized the universe, we must determine how the escape fraction of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons (fesc) depends on galaxy properties. Using the z~0.3 Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we develop and analyze new multivariate predictors of fesc. These predictions use the Cox proportional hazards model, a survival analysis technique that incorporates both detections and upper limits. Our best model predicts the LzLCS fesc detections with a root-mean-square (RMS) scatter of 0.31 dex, better than single-variable correlations. According to ranking techniques, the most important predictors of fesc are the equivalent width (EW) of Lyman-series absorption lines and the UV dust attenuation, which track line-of-sight absorption due to HI and dust. The HI absorption EW is uniquely crucial for predicting fesc for the strongest LyC emitters, which show properties similar to weaker LyC emitters and whose high fesc may therefore result from favorable orientation. In the absence of HI information, star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) and [O III]/[O II] ratio are the most predictive variables and highlight the connection between feedback and fesc. We generate a model suitable for z&gt;6, which uses only the UV slope, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, and [O III]/[O II]. We find that $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ is more important in predicting fesc at higher stellar masses, whereas [O III]/[O II] plays a greater role at lower masses. We also analyze predictions for other parameters, such as the ionizing-to-non ionizing flux ratio and Ly=alpha escape fraction.

      <title>Multivariate Predictors of LyC Escape II: Predicting LyC Escape Fractions for High-Redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST is uncovering the properties of ever increasing numbers of galaxies at z&gt;6, during the epoch of reionization. Connecting these observed populations to the process of reionization requires understanding how efficiently they produce Lyman continuum (LyC) photons and what fraction (fesc) of these photons escape into the intergalactic medium. By applying the Cox proportional hazards model, a survival analysis technique, to the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we develop new, empirical, multivariate predictions for fesc. The models developed from the LzLCS reproduce the observed fesc for z~3 samples, which suggests that LyC emitters may share similar properties at low and high redshift. Our best-performing models for the z~3 galaxies include information about dust attenuation, ionization, and/or morphology. We then apply these models to z$\gtrsim$6 galaxies. For large photometric samples, we find a median predicted fesc=0.047-0.14. For smaller spectroscopic samples, which may include stronger emission line galaxies, we find that $\geq$33% of the galaxies have fesc &gt;0.2, and we identify several candidate extreme leakers with fesc $\geq$0.5. The current samples show no strong trend between predicted fesc and UV magnitude, but limited spectroscopic information makes this result uncertain. Multivariate predictions can give significantly different results from single variable predictions, and the predicted fesc for high-redshift galaxies can differ significantly depending on whether star formation rate surface density or radius is used as a measure of galaxy morphology. We provide all parameters necessary to predict fesc for additional samples of high-redshift galaxies using these models.</description>

      <title>The Japanese Vision for the Black Hole Explorer Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a next-generation space very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) mission concept that will extend the ground-based millimeter/submillimeter arrays into space. The mission, closely aligned with the science priorities of the Japanese VLBI community, involves an active engagement of this community in the development of the mission, resulting in the formation of the Black Hole Explorer Japan Consortium. Here we present the current Japanese vision for the mission, ranging from scientific objectives to instrumentation. The Consortium anticipates a wide range of scientific investigations, from diverse black hole physics and astrophysics studied through the primary VLBI mode, to the molecular universe explored via a potential single-dish observation mode in the previously unexplored 50-70\,GHz band that would make BHEX the highest-sensitivity explorer ever of molecular oxygen. A potential major contribution for the onboard instrument involves supplying essential elements for its high-sensitivity dual-band receiving system, which includes a broadband 300\,GHz SIS mixer and a space-certified multi-stage 4.5K cryocooler akin to those used in the Hitomi and XRISM satellites by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Additionally, the Consortium explores enhancing and supporting BHEX operations through the use of millimeter/submillimeter facilities developed by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, coupled with a network of laser communication stations operated by the National Institute of Information and Communication Technology.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and the characteristics of circumstellar discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of circumstellar discs (CDs) produced in hydrodynamical simulations of gravoturbulent core collapse considering Kolmogorov and Burger-type turbulence. We report that massive discs are more prevalent in the Kolmogorov regime than for Burger-type turbulence. A significant number of discs are formed with a radius of $\sim$ 15 au in both cases. However, the number of extended discs with radii $&gt;$ 15 au is significantly larger in case of Kolmogorov turbulence. The two regimes of turbulence, in general, yield disc radii in the ranges of 7 au $-$ 30 au, and 13 au $-$ 39 au, respectively. The corresponding ranges of the disc masses are 30.37 $M_{\rm Jup}$ $-$ 0.92 M$_{\odot}$, and 2.09 $M_{\rm Jup}$ $-$ 0.13 M$_{\odot}$, respectively. Moreover, the ratio $M_{\rm disc}$/$M_{\rm star}$ is higher in models of Kolmogorov-type turbulence than in models of Burgers-type turbulence. We do not find any correlation between $R_{\rm disc}$ and $M_{\rm disc}$ over the explored range of initial temperatures (8 K $-$ 14 K) and the type of turbulence. Also, for these initial thermal variations, the turbulent circumstellar disc structures do not exhibit signs of turbulent diffusion. Nonetheless, both sub and supersonic velocity dispersions cause variations in the specific angular momentum (AM) of infalling gas, especially for CDs with radii $\sim$ 16 au $-$ 21 au. The radial profiles of CDs do not correlate with the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Age and Stellar Model Choice on Globular Cluster Color-to-Metallicity Conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photometric colors of globular clusters (GCs) act as effective proxies for metallicity, since all normally used optical/IR color indices exhibit a nonlinear but monotonic relation between their integrated color and their metallicity. One color index, (g - z) or (F475W - F850LP), has been spectroscopically calibrated in several studies, providing leverage to define color-to-metallicity conversions for other indices. In this paper, building on the work of arXiv:2307.01863, we study the GC color-metallicity relation in more detail by testing the dependence of the relations on different suites of stellar models and different assumed GC ages. Though noticeable differences between models exist, we find that the net effect on the derived GCS metallicity distributions is small.</description>

      <title>Halo Radius (Splashback Radius) of Groups and Clusters of Galaxies on small scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of a study of the distribution of galaxies in the projection along the radius ($R \leq 3R_{200c}$) for 157~groups and clusters of galaxies in the local Universe (0.01 &lt; $z$ &lt; 0.10) with line-of-sight velocity dispersions~200~km~s$^{-1}$ &lt; $ \sigma$ &lt; 1100~km~s$^{-1}$. We introduce a new observed boundary for the halos of clusters of galaxies, which we identify with the splashback radius $R_{\rm{sp}}$. We also identified the core of groups/clusters of galaxies with the radius$R_c$. These radii are determined by the observed integrated distribution of the number of galaxies as a function of squared angular radius from the center of the group/cluster, which (usually) coincides with the brightest galaxy. We found for the entire sample that the boundary of dark matter $R_{\rm{sp}}$ for groups/clusters of galaxies is proportional to the radius $R_{\rm{200c}}$ of the virialized region. We measured the mean radius $\langle R_{\rm{sp}} \rangle = 1.14\pm0.02$~Mpc for groups of galaxies ($\sigma \leq 400$~km~s$^{-1}$) and $\langle R_{\rm{sp}} \rangle = 2.00\pm0.07$~Mpc for clusters of galaxies ($\sigma &gt; 400$~km~s$^{-1}$). The mean ratio of radii is $\langle R_{\rm{sp}}/R_{\rm{200c}} \rangle = 1.40\pm0.02$}, or $\langle R_{\rm{sp}}/R_{\rm{200m}} \rangle = 0.88\pm0.02$.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Neutral Hydrogen in the Heliosphere: New Horizons Observations in the Context of Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar neutral (ISN) hydrogen is the most abundant species in the outer heliosheath and the very local interstellar medium (VLISM). Charge exchange collisions in the outer heliosheath result in filtration, reducing the ISN hydrogen density inside the heliosphere. Additionally, these atoms are intensively ionized close to the Sun, resulting in a substantial reduction of their density within a few au from the Sun. The products of this ionization - pickup ions (PUIs) - are detected by charged particle detectors. The Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on New Horizons provides, for the first time, PUI observations from the distant heliosphere. We analyze the observations collected between 22 and 52 au from the Sun to find the ISN hydrogen density profile and compare the results with predictions from global heliosphere models. We conclude that the density profile derived from the observations is inconsistent with steady-state model predictions. This discrepancy is not explained by time variations close to the Sun and thus may be related to the temporal evolution of the outer boundaries or VLISM conditions. Furthermore, we show that the cold and hot models of ISN hydrogen distribution are not a good approximation closer to the termination shock. Therefore, we recommend a new fiduciary point based on the available New Horizons observations at 40 au from the Sun, at ecliptic direction (285.62{\deg}, 1.94{\deg}), where the ISN hydrogen density is 0.11 cm$^{-3}$. The continued operation of New Horizons should give better insight into the source of the discussed discrepancy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I summarize the stellar side of the cosmological lithium problem(s). Evidence from independent studies is accumulating and indicates that stars may very well be fully responsible for lowering their surface lithium from the predicted primordial value to observed levels through internal element-transport mechanisms collectively referred to as atomic diffusion. While atomic diffusion can be modelled from first principles, stellar evolution uses a parametrized representation of convection making it impossible to predict convective-boundary mixing as a vital stellar process moderating atomic diffusion. More work is clearly needed here for a fully quantitative picture of lithium (and metallicity) evolution as stars age. Lastly, note that inferred stellar lithium-6 abundances have all but disappeared.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Explorer Cryocooling Instrument</title>

Abstract: The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a space-based very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) mission aimed at precision black hole measurements, detecting the photon ring around black holes, exploring spacetime, spin, and mass properties, and validating predictions of General Relativity. These objectives are achieved using cryogenic receivers with quantum-limited sensitivities across a broad frequency range. Dual-band receivers at 80-106 GHz and 240-320 GHz require operating temperatures of 20 K and 4.5 K, respectively. A cryocooling system with two cold stages will be employed: a 20 K stage handling a 125 mW heat load and a 4.5 K stage handling a 10 mW heat load.
  To design the cryocooling system, the mission leverages existing space industry technology at high Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), informed by missions such as Planck, JEM/SMILES, Hitomi, and XRISM, and advancements from the ACTDP/JWST program. Integrating the cryocooler with the receivers and broader instrument involves careful consideration of thermal challenges, including linking the cold ends of each cooling stage to minimize heat losses and ensuring adequate passive cooling for the cryocooler warm end heat rejection.
  Key challenges and trade-offs include sizing the mass and reducing power consumption while meeting the receiver cold temperature requirements, which impact the scientific objectives. This paper addresses efforts to balance the scientific requirements with the limitations of technical cryocooling capabilities within the framework of a small-class (SMEX) space mission, presenting an overview of cooling needs, initial design considerations, a survey of 4 K spaceflight cryocooler developments, and trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in Multiphase Turbulence: Impacts on Dynamics and Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both multiphase gas and magnetic fields are ubiquitous in astrophysics. However, the influence of magnetic fields on mixing of the different phases is still largely unexplored. In this study, we use both turbulent radiative mixing layer (TRML) and turbulent box simulations to examine the effects of magnetic fields on cold gas growth rates, survival, and the morphology of the multiphase gas. Our findings indicate that, in general, magnetic fields suppress mixing in TRMLs while turbulent box simulations show comparatively marginal differences in growth rates and survival of the cold gas. We reconcile these two seemingly contrasting results by demonstrating that similar turbulent properties result in comparable mixing -- regardless of the presence or absence of magnetic fields. We, furthermore, find the cold gas clump size distribution to be independent of the magnetic fields but the clumps are more filamentary in the MHD case. Synthetic MgII absorption lines support this picture being marginally different with and without magnetic fields; both cases aligning well with observations. We also examine the magnetic field strength and structure in turbulent boxes. We generally observe a higher mean magnetic field in the cold gas phase due to flux freezing and reveal fractal-like magnetic field lines in a turbulent environment.</description>

      <title>On the Doublet Flux Ratio of Mg II Resonance Lines in and Around Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of metallic doublet emission lines, particularly Mg II 2796, 2803, provide crucial information for understanding galaxies and their circumgalactic medium. This study explores the effects of resonant scattering on the Mg II doublet lines and the stellar continuum in spherical and cylindrical geometries. Our findings show that under certain circumstances, resonance scattering can cause an increase in the doublet flux ratio and the escaping flux of the lines beyond what are expected in optically thin spherical media. As expected, the doublet ratio is consistently lower than the intrinsic ratio when the scattering medium is spherically symmetric and dusty. However, if the scattering medium has a disk shape, such as face-on disk galaxies, and is viewed face-on, the doublet ratio is predicted to be higher than two. These results may provide a valuable insight regarding the complexity of the shape and orientation of distant, spatially-unresolved galaxies. The importance of the continuum-pumped emission lines and expanding media is discussed to understand various observational aspects, including doublet flux ratios, which can be lower than 1.5 or higher than two, as well as symmetric or asymmetric line profiles. It is also discussed that the diffuse warm neutral medium would be an essential source of Mg II emission lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the B{\"o}hm-Vitense gap, a gap in the colours of stars that occurs when the atmosphere changes from radiative to convective in deep layers. We are using different algorithms for detecting gaps in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), including the k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) and UniDip algorithms. We propose using a combination of the k-NN algorithm and the UniDip algorithm and manual verification to identify gaps unlikely to be of a statistical origin. Using the $Gaia$ photometric system, i.e. $BP-RP$, we took the data of 130 star clusters and searched for gaps in the ranges of 0.40 to 0.47\,mag, and 0.56 to 0.60\,mag, respectively. We analysed all data statistically and identified the gaps in the individual clusters. Finally, we applied the kernel density estimator to see how the gaps are distributed.</description>

Abstract: We report the serendipitous multiwavelength discovery of a candidate dual black hole system with a separation of $\sim$100 pc, in the gas-rich luminous infrared galaxy MCG-03-34-64 (z=0.016). Hubble Space Telescope/ACS observations show three distinct optical centroids in the [O III] narrow-band and F814W images. Subsequent analysis of Chandra/ACIS data shows two spatially-resolved peaks of equal intensity in the neutral Fe K$\alpha$ (6.2-6.6 keV) band, while high-resolution radio continuum observations with the Very Large Array at 8.46 GHz (3.6 cm band) show two spatially-coincident radio peaks. Fast shocks as the ionizing source seem unlikely, given the energies required for production of Fe K$\alpha$. If confirmed, the separation of $\sim$100 pc would represent the closest dual AGN reported to date with spatially-resolved, multiwavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Size-Mass Relations for Simulated Low-Mass Galaxies: Mock Imaging versus Intrinsic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observationally-inferred size versus stellar-mass relationship (SMR) for low-mass galaxies provides an important test for galaxy formation models. However, the relationship relies on assumptions that relate observed luminosity profiles to underlying stellar mass profiles. Here we use the Feedback in Realistic Environments simulations of low-mass galaxies to explore how the predicted SMR changes depending on whether one uses star-particle counts directly or mock observations. We reproduce the SMR found in The Exploration of Local Volume Satellites survey remarkably well only when we infer stellar masses and sizes using mock observations. However, when we use star particles to directly infer stellar masses and half-mass radii, we find that our galaxies are too large and obey a SMR with too little scatter compared to observations. This discrepancy between the "true" galaxy size and mass and those derived in the mock observation approach is twofold. First, our simulated galaxies have higher and more varied MLRs at a fixed colour than those commonly-adopted, which tends to underestimate their stellar masses compared to their true, simulated values. Second, our galaxies have radially increasing MLR gradients therefore using a single MLR tends to under-predict the mass in the outer regions. Similarly, the true half-mass radius is larger than the half-light radius because the light is more concentrated than the mass. If our simulations are accurate representations of the real universe, then the relationship between galaxy size and stellar mass is even tighter for low-mass galaxies than is commonly inferred from observed relations.</description>

Abstract: We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding dark-matter-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the "fixed &amp; paired" variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.</description>

      <title>A JWST/MIRI and NIRCam Analysis of the Young Stellar Object Population in the Spitzer I region of NGC 6822</title>

Abstract: We present an imaging survey of the Spitzer I star-forming region in NGC 6822 conducted with the NIRCam and MIRI instruments onboard JWST. Located at a distance of 490 kpc, NGC 6822 is the nearest non-interacting low-metallicity ($\sim$0.2 $Z_{\odot}$) dwarf galaxy. It hosts some of the brightest known HII regions in the local universe, including recently discovered sites of highly-embedded active star formation. Of these, Spitzer I is the youngest and most active, and houses 90 color-selected candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) identified from Spitzer Space Telescope observations. We revisit the YSO population of Spitzer I with these new JWST observations. By analyzing color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) constructed with NIRCam and MIRI data, we establish color selection criteria and construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to identify candidate YSOs and characterize the full population of young stars, from the most embedded phase to the more evolved stages. In this way, we have identified 140 YSOs in Spitzer I. Comparing to previous Spitzer studies of the NGC 6822 YSO population, we find that the YSOs we identify are fainter and less massive, indicating that the improved resolution of JWST allows us to resolve previously blended sources into multiple objects.</description>

      <title>Near Real-Time Gravitational Wave Data Analysis of the Massive Black Hole Binary with TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave (GW) detectors can detect the merger of massive black holes. The early warning and localization of GW events before merging can be used to inform electromagnetic telescopes and conduct multimessenger observations. However, this requires real-time data transmission and analysis capabilities. The geocentric orbit of the space-borne GW detector TianQin makes it possible to conduct real-time data transmission. In this study, we develop a search and localization pipeline for massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with TianQin under both regular and real-time data transmission modes. We demonstrate that, with real-time data transmission, MBHBs can be accurately localized on the fly. With the approaching merger, each analysis can be finished in only 40 min. For an MBHB system at a distance of 1 Gpc, if we receive data every hour, then we can pinpoint its location to within less than 1 deg$^2$ on the final day before the merger.</description>

      <title>Galaxy lens reconstruction based on strongly lensed gravitational waves: similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06463</link>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) galaxy lens reconstruction is a crucial step for many GW lensing science applications. However, dark siren GW lensing (i.e. lensed GW without observed electromagnetic (EM) counterpart) suffers from similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy. We review these two degeneracies and discuss their implications on GW-based lens reconstruction and two well-known GW lensing science cases: the Hubble constant measurement and test for modified GW propagation. Building upon previous works, our conclusions are:1) GWs can only infer the scale-free lens mass model parameters, the dimensionless source position, the GW luminosity distance and the time delay scaling (a combination of Einstein radius, lens redshift, and cosmology).2) Lens reconstruction (of singular isothermal ellipsoid lens) with only two GW signals is unlikely to yield a complete lens model, while four (three) signals can measure all the above parameters accurately (with large uncertainties).3) The similarity transformation degeneracy causes the lens redshift/Einstein radius/cosmology to be degenerate in dark siren measurements. Breaking the degeneracy can be achieved by supplementing the GWs with EM observation of lens redshifts/Einstein radius (source redshift is not required).4) The mass-sheet degeneracy causes the GW luminosity distance to be entirely degenerate with a constant mass sheet.5) Contrary to expectation, the Hubble constant is degenerate with the mass-sheet even when supplemented with lens reconstruction/redshift/Einstein radius and can only be lifted with lens galaxy velocity dispersion measurement, while modified GW propagation test discussed in prior literature is unaffected by the degeneracy. These properties highlight the need for GW observations to be supplemented by EM observations, which could become accessible through a lens archival search or a rapid EM follow-up.</description>
