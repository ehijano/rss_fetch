      <title>Subjective and Objective Quality-of-Experience Evaluation Study for Live Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, live video streaming has gained widespread popularity across various social media platforms. Quality of experience (QoE), which reflects end-users' satisfaction and overall experience, plays a critical role for media service providers to optimize large-scale live compression and transmission strategies to achieve perceptually optimal rate-distortion trade-off. Although many QoE metrics for video-on-demand (VoD) have been proposed, there remain significant challenges in developing QoE metrics for live video streaming. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of subjective and objective QoE evaluations for live video streaming. For the subjective QoE study, we introduce the first live video streaming QoE dataset, TaoLive QoE, which consists of $42$ source videos collected from real live broadcasts and $1,155$ corresponding distorted ones degraded due to a variety of streaming distortions, including conventional streaming distortions such as compression, stalling, as well as live streaming-specific distortions like frame skipping, variable frame rate, etc. Subsequently, a human study was conducted to derive subjective QoE scores of videos in the TaoLive QoE dataset. For the objective QoE study, we benchmark existing QoE models on the TaoLive QoE dataset as well as publicly available QoE datasets for VoD scenarios, highlighting that current models struggle to accurately assess video QoE, particularly for live content. Hence, we propose an end-to-end QoE evaluation model, Tao-QoE, which integrates multi-scale semantic features and optical flow-based motion features to predicting a retrospective QoE score, eliminating reliance on statistical quality of service (QoS) features.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Popularity of Events on Web by Sparsity and Mutual-Excitation Guided Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The content of a webpage described or posted an event in the cyberspace inevitably reflects viewpoints, values and trends of the physical society. Mapping an event on web to the popularity score plays a pivot role to sense the social trends from the cyberspace. However, the complex semantic correspondence between texts and images, as well as the implicit text-image-popularity mapping mechanics pose a significant challenge to this non-trivial task. In this paper, we address this problem from a viewpoint of understanding the interpretable mapping mechanics. Concretely, we organize the keywords from different events into an unified graph. The unified graph facilitates to model the popularity of events via two-level mappings, i.e., the self excitation and the mutual excitation. The self-excitation assumes that each keyword forms the popularity while the mutual-excitation models that two keywords would excite each other to determine the popularity of an event. Specifically, we use Graph Neural Network (GNN) as the backbone to model the self-excitation, the mutual excitation and the context of images into a sparse and deep factor model. Besides, to our best knowledge, we release a challenge web event dataset for the popularity prediction task. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>AIM 2024 Challenge on Efficient Video Super-Resolution for AV1 Compressed Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) is a critical task for enhancing low-bitrate and low-resolution videos, particularly in streaming applications. While numerous solutions have been developed, they often suffer from high computational demands, resulting in low frame rates (FPS) and poor power efficiency, especially on mobile platforms. In this work, we compile different methods to address these challenges, the solutions are end-to-end real-time video super-resolution frameworks optimized for both high performance and low runtime. We also introduce a new test set of high-quality 4K videos to further validate the approaches. The proposed solutions tackle video up-scaling for two applications: 540p to 4K (x4) as a general case, and 360p to 1080p (x3) more tailored towards mobile devices. In both tracks, the solutions have a reduced number of parameters and operations (MACs), allow high FPS, and improve VMAF and PSNR over interpolation baselines. This report gauges some of the most efficient video super-resolution methods to date.</description>

      <title>A Simple but Strong Baseline for Sounding Video Generation: Effective Adaptation of Audio and Video Diffusion Models for Joint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we build a simple but strong baseline for sounding video generation. Given base diffusion models for audio and video, we integrate them with additional modules into a single model and train it to make the model jointly generate audio and video. To enhance alignment between audio-video pairs, we introduce two novel mechanisms in our model. The first one is timestep adjustment, which provides different timestep information to each base model. It is designed to align how samples are generated along with timesteps across modalities. The second one is a new design of the additional modules, termed Cross-Modal Conditioning as Positional Encoding (CMC-PE). In CMC-PE, cross-modal information is embedded as if it represents temporal position information, and the embeddings are fed into the model like positional encoding. Compared with the popular cross-attention mechanism, CMC-PE provides a better inductive bias for temporal alignment in the generated data. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the two newly introduced mechanisms and also demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Single-Branch Embedding Network for Recommendation in Cold-Start and Missing Modality Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering (CF) and provide recommendations based on past collective interactions. Therefore, the performance of CF algorithms degrades when few or no interactions are available, a scenario referred to as cold-start. To address this issue, previous work relies on models leveraging both collaborative data and side information on the users or items. Similar to multimodal learning, these models aim at combining collaborative and content representations in a shared embedding space. In this work we propose a novel technique for multimodal recommendation, relying on a multimodal Single-Branch embedding network for Recommendation (SiBraR). Leveraging weight-sharing, SiBraR encodes interaction data as well as multimodal side information using the same single-branch embedding network on different modalities. This makes SiBraR effective in scenarios of missing modality, including cold start. Our extensive experiments on large-scale recommendation datasets from three different recommendation domains (music, movie, and e-commerce) and providing multimodal content information (audio, text, image, labels, and interactions) show that SiBraR significantly outperforms CF as well as state-of-the-art content-based RSs in cold-start scenarios, and is competitive in warm scenarios. We show that SiBraR's recommendations are accurate in missing modality scenarios, and that the model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared embedding space, hence reducing the modality gap.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Acoustic Similarity in Emotional Speech and Music via Self-Supervised Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech and music shares similarities due to their acoustic overlap, which has led to interest in transferring knowledge between these domains. However, the shared acoustic cues between speech and music, particularly those encoded by Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models, remain largely unexplored, given the fact that SSL models for speech and music have rarely been applied in cross-domain research. In this work, we revisit the acoustic similarity between emotion speech and music, starting with an analysis of the layerwise behavior of SSL models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Music Emotion Recognition (MER). Furthermore, we perform cross-domain adaptation by comparing several approaches in a two-stage fine-tuning process, examining effective ways to utilize music for SER and speech for MER. Lastly, we explore the acoustic similarities between emotional speech and music using Frechet audio distance for individual emotions, uncovering the issue of emotion bias in both speech and music SSL models. Our findings reveal that while speech and music SSL models do capture shared acoustic features, their behaviors can vary depending on different emotions due to their training strategies and domain-specificities. Additionally, parameter-efficient fine-tuning can enhance SER and MER performance by leveraging knowledge from each other. This study provides new insights into the acoustic similarity between emotional speech and music, and highlights the potential for cross-domain generalization to improve SER and MER systems.</description>

      <title>Arena: A Patch-of-Interest ViT Inference Acceleration System for Edge-Assisted Video Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of edge computing has made real-time intelligent video analytics feasible. Previous works, based on traditional model architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, etc.), employ various strategies to filter out non-region-of-interest content to minimize bandwidth and computation consumption but show inferior performance in adverse environments. Recently, visual foundation models based on transformers have shown great performance in adverse environments due to their amazing generalization capability. However, they require a large amount of computation power, which limits their applications in real-time intelligent video analytics. In this paper, we find visual foundation models like Vision Transformer (ViT) also have a dedicated acceleration mechanism for video analytics. To this end, we introduce Arena, an end-to-end edge-assisted video inference acceleration system based on ViT. We leverage the capability of ViT that can be accelerated through token pruning by only offloading and feeding Patches-of-Interest to the downstream models. Additionally, we design an adaptive keyframe inference switching algorithm tailored to different videos, capable of adapting to the current video content to jointly optimize accuracy and bandwidth. Through extensive experiments, our findings reveal that Arena can boost inference speeds by up to 1.58\(\times\) and 1.82\(\times\) on average while consuming only 47\% and 31\% of the bandwidth, respectively, all with high inference accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion via Hypergraph Autoencoder and Contrastive Learning for Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) seeks to identify the speakers' emotions expressed in each utterance, offering significant potential across diverse fields. The challenge of MERC lies in balancing speaker modeling and context modeling, encompassing both long-distance and short-distance contexts, as well as addressing the complexity of multimodal information fusion. Recent research adopts graph-based methods to model intricate conversational relationships effectively. Nevertheless, the majority of these methods utilize a fixed fully connected structure to link all utterances, relying on convolution to interpret complex context. This approach can inherently heighten the redundancy in contextual messages and excessive graph network smoothing, particularly in the context of long-distance conversations. To address this issue, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts hypergraph connections by variational hypergraph autoencoder (VHGAE), and employs contrastive learning to mitigate uncertainty factors during the reconstruction process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal against the state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets. We release the code to support the reproducibility of this work at https://github.com/yzjred/-HAUCL.</description>

      <title>Exploring Event-based Human Pose Estimation with 3D Event Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human pose estimation is a fundamental and appealing task in computer vision. Although traditional cameras are commonly applied, their reliability decreases in scenarios under high dynamic range or heavy motion blur, where event cameras offer a robust solution. Predominant event-based methods accumulate events into frames, ignoring the asynchronous and high temporal resolution that is crucial for distinguishing distinct actions. To address this issue and to unlock the 3D potential of event information, we introduce two 3D event representations: the Rasterized Event Point Cloud (RasEPC) and the Decoupled Event Voxel (DEV). The RasEPC aggregates events within concise temporal slices at identical positions, preserving their 3D attributes along with statistical information, thereby significantly reducing memory and computational demands. Meanwhile, the DEV representation discretizes events into voxels and projects them across three orthogonal planes, utilizing decoupled event attention to retrieve 3D cues from the 2D planes. Furthermore, we develop and release EV-3DPW, a synthetic event-based dataset crafted to facilitate training and quantitative analysis in outdoor scenes. Our methods are tested on the DHP19 public dataset, MMHPSD dataset, and our EV-3DPW dataset, with further qualitative validation via a derived driving scene dataset EV-JAAD and an outdoor collection vehicle. Our code and dataset have been made publicly available at https://github.com/MasterHow/EventPointPose.</description>
