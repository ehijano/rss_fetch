      <title>Phases of Interacting Fibonacci Anyons on a Ladder at Half-Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional many-body quantum systems can exhibit topological order and support collective excitations with anyonic statistics different from the usual fermionic or bosonic ones. With the emergence of these exotic point-like particles, it is natural to ask what phases can arise in interacting many-anyon systems. To study this topic, we consider the particular case of Fibonacci anyons subject to an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor repulsion on a two-leg ladder. Focusing on the case of half-filling, for low interaction strengths an ''anyonic'' metal is found, whereas for strong repulsion, the anyons form an insulating charge-density wave. Within the latter regime, we introduce an effective one-dimensional model up to sixth order in perturbation theory arising from anyonic superexchange processes. We numerically identify four distinct phases of the effective model, which we characterize using matrix product state methods. These include both the ferro- and antiferromagnetic golden chain, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase, and an incommensurate phase.</description>

      <title>What is the topological dual of the XXZ spin Chain?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a dual symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Hamiltonian for the $U(1)$ symmetric anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain-a model that has traditionally been used to study spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, with an intervening extended Luttinger liquid phase. By performing a non-local unitary transformation, we explicitly construct a local fermionic Hamiltonian that exhibits two nontrivial topological phases separated by an extended Luttinger liquid regime. We demonstrate the topological nature of these phases by analyzing the entanglement structure, deriving a non-local string order parameter, and constructing an exact zero mode operator that connects states in different fermionic parity sectors.</description>

      <title>Chiral Wigner crystal phases induced by Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the impact of Berry phase on the Wigner crystal (WC) state of a two-dimensional electron system. We consider first a model of Bernal bilayer graphene with a perpendicular displacement field, and we show that Berry curvature leads to a new kind of WC state in which the electrons acquire a spontaneous orbital angular momentum when the displacement field exceeds a critical value. We determine the phase boundary of the WC state in terms of electron density and displacement field at low temperature. We then derive the general effective Hamiltonian that governs the ordering of the physical electron spin. We show that this Hamiltonian includes a chiral term that can drive the system into chiral spin-density wave or spin liquid phases. The phenomena we discuss are relevant for the valley-polarized Wigner crystal phases observed in multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Continuous transition from Fermi liquid to A fractional Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments in moir\'e materials have observed fractional Chern insulators (FCI) at zero magnetic field, providing an opportunity to study the transition from FCI to the more conventional phases such as Fermi liquid (FL) and superconductor (SC) by tuning the interaction strength or bandwidth. In this work, we formulate a critical theory for a continuous transition at the filling $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ between the FL and a FCI* phase that hosts an additional neutral sector, but has the same transport signatures as the usual FCI. In our framework, this corresponds to a transition from a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) to a superfluid* phase of the composite bosons. The Fermi liquid close to the transition has an additional factor $|z_i-z_j|^6$ in its wavefunction. Also, the transport behavior at high temperature on the FL side is actually like an `anyon gas' phase on top of the FCI, with $\rho_{xy}$ close to $\frac{3}{2}\frac{h}{e^2}$. FL behavior with $\rho_{xy} \approx 0$ is recovered only at very low temperature. We also briefly discuss the possibility of a chiral superconductor as the descendant of this strongly correlated FL and the potential relevance to the twisted MoTe$_2$ system.</description>

      <title>calcQPI: A versatile tool to simulate quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.</description>

      <title>Magnetism of kagome metals $\left(\text{Fe}_{1-x} \text{Co}_{x}\right) \text{Sn}$ studied by $\mu$SR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the magnetic properties of the metallic kagome system $\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{1-x} \mathrm{Co}_{x}\right) \mathrm{Sn}$ by a combination of Muon Spin Relaxation ($\mu \mathrm{SR}$), magnetic susceptibility and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) measurements, in single crystal specimens with Co concentrations $\mathrm{x}=0,0.11,0.8$. In the undoped antiferromagnetic compound FeSn, we find possible signatures for a previously unidentified phase that sets in at $T^*\sim 50$ K, well beneath the Neel temperature $T_N \sim 376$ K, as indicated by a peak in the relaxation rate $1/T_1$ observed in zero field (ZF) and longitudinal field (LF) $\mu \mathrm{SR}$ measurements, with a corresponding anomaly in the ac and dc-susceptibility, and an increase in the static width $1/T_2$ in ZF measurements. No signatures of spatial symmetry breaking are found in STM down to $7$ K. In $\mathrm{Fe}_{0.2} \mathrm{Co}_{0.8} \mathrm{Sn}$, we find canonical spin glass behavior with freezing temperature $T_{g} \sim 3.5 \mathrm{~K}$; the ZF and LF time spectra exhibit results similar to those observed in dilute alloy spin glasses CuMn and AuFe, with a critical behavior of $1 / T_{1}$ at $T_{g}$ and $1 / \mathrm{T}_{1}\rightarrow 0$ as $T \rightarrow 0$. The absence of spin dynamics at low temperatures makes a clear contrast to the spin dynamics observed by $\mu \mathrm{SR}$ in many geometrically frustrated spin systems on insulating kagome, pyrochlore, and triangular lattices. The spin glass behavior of CoSn doped with dilute Fe moments is shown to originate primarily from the randomness of doped Fe moments rather than due to geometrical frustration of the underlying lattice.</description>

      <title>Scan calculation of the density of states: real space cluster perturbation theory applied to inhomogeneous Hubbard model in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectral analysis of a one-dimensional Hubbard model with a parabolic potential, using a real-space cluster perturbation theory (rCPT) designed to study spatially inhomogeneous electron systems with strong correlation. It is a natural extension of the conventional CPT to inhomogeneous cases by computing local Green's functions while averaging over multiple cluster boundaries. We find that the local density of states of at each site mirrors that of a homogeneous system with the same local filling. This insight offers a perspective on spectral evolution in inhomogeneous systems used to scan the occupancy-dependent features of the homogeneous system, making this setup a practical one-shot spectroscopy tool for ultracold atoms in harmonic traps.</description>

      <title>Monopole Traps for Position-Based Information Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a spin-ice-based heterostructure capable of encoding magnetic monopole quasiparticle positions for non-volatile information storage applications. Building upon two-dimensional magnetic monopole gases formed at the interface between 2-in-2-out spin ice and all-in-all-out antiferromagnetic pyrochlore iridate, the design introduces a 3-in-1-out/1-in-3-out fragmented barrier layer into the spin-ice matrix, defining two energetically stable monopole traps. The occupancy of these traps can be deterministically controlled by an externally applied magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations reveal robust bistable switching, thermal stability below 0.22 K, and fully reversible field-driven transitions, demonstrating the system's potential for reliable, repeatable memory operation. Crucially, the heterostructure exhibits emergent ferromagnetism linked to monopole position, enabling non-destructive readout of the memory state via spatially resolved magnetic imaging. Unlike topological carriers such as skyrmions, monopoles confined at the sub-nanometer scale offer three orders of magnitude higher information density. These results establish these monopole-trap heterostructures as a scalable platform for next-generation ultra-compact memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality by Interaction Frustration in a Square-Planar Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental and theoretical investigations on ThCr$_2$Ge$_2$C, a metallic compound in which Cr$_2$C planes form a square-planar lattice. Neutron powder diffraction, magnetization, and specific heat measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic order or short-range spin freezing down to 70~mK. Quantum critical behavior was indicated through logarithmic divergences in both the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat divided by temperature. Resistivity measurements exhibit non-Fermi-liquid behavior, with a Fermi liquid recovered under magnetic fields or high pressures. First-principles calculations identify competing nearest-neighbor ($J_1$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($J_2$) exchange interactions, with $J_2/J_1 \sim -0.5$, pointing to strong magnetic frustration. The interaction frustration is reduced, and magnetically ordered phases are stabilized upon the application of negative or positive pressures. This work offers a rare example of zero-field, ambient pressure quantum criticality mainly driven by interaction frustration in a square lattice.</description>

      <title>Sequential Circuit as Generalized Symmetry on Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized symmetry extends the usual notion of symmetry to ones that are of higher-form, acting on subsystems, non-invertible, etc. The concept was originally defined in the field theory context using the idea of topological defects. On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is moved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask how to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the unitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit constrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for symmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome, which we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines the symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast, for unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the Cheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full description. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator representations play an important role in our discussion.</description>

      <title>Observation of spin-conserving two-spinon continuum in the $S$=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain system Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ using Cu $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a Cu $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of spin excitations in the $S$=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain system Sr$_2$CuO$_3$. The spectral weight observed below the charge-transfer gap appears in two-spinon continuum, indicating the fractionalization of a spin-conserving ($\Delta S = 0$) magnetic excitation into two-spinon states. The intensity of these excitations reaches a maximum near the midpoint between the center and the boundary of the Brillouin zone, and decreases toward the zone boundary; this behavior contrasts with that of the spin-flip ($\Delta S = 1$) excitations typically observed via inelastic neutron scattering or Cu $L_3$-edge RIXS. The momentum dependence of the intensity is described by the spin-exchange dynamical structure factor. A phenomenological analysis of the symmetry between the polarization and the $d$ orbital explains the resonance condition for the two-spinon excitations.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Order and Magnetic Frustration in the Honeycomb Heavy-Fermion System Ce(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_{x}$)$_6$Al$_3$: $^{27}$Al and $^{195}$Pt NMR Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-fermion systems with magnetic frustration offer a rich platform for investigating the interplay among Kondo screening, magnetic frustration, and quantum criticality. We report comprehensive $^{27}$Al and $^{195}$Pt nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on polycrystalline Ce(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_{x}$)$_6$Al$_3$ ($x = 0$, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). For $x = 0$, the Knight shift, linewidth, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate reveal a paramagnetic heavy-fermion ground state persisting down to 0.1~K, characterized by a coherence temperature $T_{\mathrm{coh}} \simeq 15$~K. Substituting Pd induces antiferromagnetic order at $T_{\mathrm{N}} \simeq 3.5$~K, while suppressing $T_{\mathrm{coh}}$. Comparison between $x = 0.1$ and $x = 0.3$ reveals a crossover from itinerant spin-density-wave antiferromagnetism to more localized-moment antiferromagnetism, indicating a shift toward the localized side of the Doniach phase diagram. These findings establish Ce(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_{x}$)$_6$Al$_3$ as a tunable platform to explore the competition between Kondo screening and magnetic frustration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast disordering observed after photo-excitation challenges the conventional picture of photo-induced transitions where symmetry-breaking takes place along a single collective coordinate. We propose that key spectroscopic signatures of these transient disordered states can be revealed through stochastic resonance, a hallmark of nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Studying the disordered phase of Holstein model we show that, at given frequency, the linear response as a function of temperature has a peak, which indicates enhanced coherent switching between metastable configurations. From this resonance, we extract the intrinsic stochastic transition timescale and energy barrier separating equivalent local minima. This mechanism offers a new perspective to identify and characterize hidden disordered phases in driven many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Floquet Theory of lattice electrons coupled to an off-resonant cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Floquet theory and the High-Frequency expansion to derive an effective Hamiltonian for electrons coupled to an off resonant cavity mode, either in its vacuum or driven by classical light. For vacuum fields, we show that long-range hopping and cavity-mediated interactions arise as a direct consequence of quantum fluctuations. As an application, this method is applied to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. At high light-matter coupling, our results reveal significant deviations from mean-field predictions, with our framework capturing light-matter entanglement through the Floquet micromotion. Furthermore, the cavity-mediated interactions appearing at first order are shown to be crucial to the description of the system at sufficiently strong light-matter coupling for a fixed cavity frequency. Finally, a drive resonant with the cavity is added with the SSH chain displaying dynamical behavior dependent on the cavity parameters.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Modulation of Flat Bands via Controllable Charge-Density-Waves Defects in 4Hb-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron correlation is a main driver of exotic quantum phases and their interplay. The 4Hb-TaS2 system, possessing intrinsic heterostructure of 1T- and 1H-TaS2 monolayers, offers a unique opportunity to control electron correlation by distorting the atomic lattice or tuning interlayer coupling. Here, we investigated intrinsically deformed charge-density-waves (CDW) in the 1T layer of 4Hb-TaS2 to elucidate and control their effects on flat bands using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) combined with first-principles calculations. We identified two types of CDW defects: Type 1 has structural distortion and locally suppressed flat bands, while Type 2 features an increased flat band filling factor of intact CDW structure. Density functional theory calculations indicate that a sulfur vacancy in the 1T layer distorts the CDW structure and gives rise to a Type 1, whereas a sulfur vacancy in the 1H layer reduces the interlayer charge transfer and lead to a Type 2. Furthermore, we demonstrated creating and erasing individual CDW defects via STM manipulation. Our findings provide a pathway to not only tune flat bands but also selectively manipulate the interaction between CDW, the atomic lattice, and interlayer coupling in strongly correlated systems with atomic precision.</description>

      <title>Anyon Condensation in Virasoro TQFT: Wormhole Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11486v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyon condensation in wormhole geometries is investigated in the Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) formulation, a proposed reformulation of 3d AdS quantum gravity. We first review some elementary techniques of VTQFT and summarize a gauging scheme for non-invertible symmetries referred to as anyon condensation. We then exhibit that anyon condensation is applicable to VTQFT even though the category of Wilson lines associated with it is not strictly a modular tensor category (MTC) due to the continuously infinite label $p\in\mathbb{R}_+$. More specifically, it is shown that the partition function of the wormhole factorizes upon condensing the so-called diagonal condensable anyon $\mathcal{A}=\int_{0}^{\infty}dp\,L_p\boxtimes\overline{L}_p$ in VTQFT. The resulting $2$d boundary theory is Liouville CFT by symmetry TFT construction, and to our knowledge, this is among the very few explicit computational examples of gauging \textit{continuous non-invertible} symmetries in the literature.</description>

      <title>Persistent spin currents in superconducting altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductors are famously capable of supporting persistent electrical currents, that is, currents that flow without any measurable decay as long as the material is kept in the superconducting state. We introduce here a class of materials -- superconducting altermagnets -- that can both generate and carry persistent {\em spin} currents. This includes spin-polarized electrical supercurrent as well as pure spin supercurrent that facilitates spin transport in the absence of any charge transport. A key to this remarkable property is the realization that the leading superconducting instability of altermagnetic metals consists of two independent condensates formed of spin-up and spin-down electrons. In the non-relativistic limit the two condensates are decoupled and can thus naturally support persistent currents with any spin polarization, including pure spin supercurrents realized in the charge counterflow regime. We describe a novel ``spin-current dynamo effect'' that can be used to generate pure spin supercurrent in such systems by driving a charge current along certain crystallographic directions. Away from the non-relativistic limit, when spin-orbit interactions and magnetic disorder are present, we find that the spin current generically develops spatial oscillations but, importantly, no dissipation or decay. This is in stark contrast to spin currents in normal diffusive metals which tend to decay on relatively short lengthscales. We illustrate the above properties by performing model calculations relevant to two distinct classes of altermagnets and various device geometries.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of microstructured devices of the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn5 for investigations of isolated grain boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grain boundaries are critical for determining the functionality of polycrystalline materials. Here we present on the structural $\&amp;$ transport properties of grain boundaries in the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. We provide a detailed recipe for the fabrication of isolated grain boundary devices from of as-grown polycrystalline samples of CeCoIn$_5$. Electron backscattered diffraction imaging of polycrystalline CeCoIn$_5$ samples reveals an abundance of $90^\circ$ misorientation grain boundaries suggesting a preferential nucleation of CeCoIn$_5$ grains with 90$^\circ$ misorientation over a random distribution of grain orientations. Transport measurements across grain boundary devices establish coherence of superconductivity and allows us to establish a lower bound on the critical current density for the grain boundaries. Our work opens new possibilities for fabrication of quantum devices such as Josephson-junctions out of bulk unconventional superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Excitations of a Half-Filled Tl-based Cuprate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong electron correlations drive Mott insulator transitions. Yet, there exists no framework to classify Mott insulators by their degree of correlation. Cuprate superconductors, with their tunable doping and rich phase diagrams, offer a unique platform to investigate the evolution of those interactions. However, spectroscopic access to a clean half-filled Mott-insulating state is lacking in compounds with the highest superconducting onset temperature. To fill this gap, we introduce a pristine, half-filled thallium-based cuprate system, Tl$_2$Ba$_5$Cu$_4$O$_{10+x}$ (Tl2504). Using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), we probe long-lived magnon excitations and uncover a pronounced kink in the magnon dispersion, marked by a simultaneous change in group velocity and lifetime broadening. Modeling the dispersion within a Hubbard-Heisenberg approach, we extract the interaction strength and compare it with other cuprate systems. Our results establish a cuprate universal relation between electron-electron interaction and magnon zone-boundary dispersion. Superconductivity seems to be optimal at intermediate correlation strength, suggesting an optimal balance between localization and itinerancy.</description>

      <title>Complexity in multiqubit and many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of $n$-qubit and many body systems is investigated. In case of an $n$-qubit system the disturbance due to depolarization and dephasing is identified based on a certain complexity quantity defined as the difference of the Shannon-entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of order two. In case of the effect of the depolarization the quantum system is replaced by a fully separable, i.e. classical state with probability $p$ while it remains unchanged with probability $1-p$. Whereas dephasing is modelled by destructing the appropriate off-diagonal elements of the density matrix also with probability $p$. For both cases the state with maximal complexity marks the border between the most quantum and most classical limits. Furthermore we also show that many body systems modelled using deformed random matrix ensembles, deformed two-body random interaction ensembles and also the system of one-dimensional Heisenberg-model of spins subject to a random, local magnetic field exhibiting many body localization transition, the states with maximal complexity mark the cross-over or the transition point between integrability and full quantum chaos. Finally we address the question of identifying the cross-over in the thermalization properties within large sets of quantum chaotic states using the survival probability of an excitation of a many body system. All these results show that the complexity parameter defined on a combination of the von Neumann entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of 2nd order is a meaningful and informative parameter to detect whenever a system is in a cross-over state between the otherwise trivial extremal cases of integrability or localization and quantum chaos or ergodic behavior.</description>

      <title>Universal Magnetic Phases in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) has emerged as a robust platform for exploring correlated topological phases, notably supporting fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states at zero magnetic field across a wide range of twist angles. The evolution of magnetism and topology with twist angle remains an open question. Here, we systematically map the magnetic phase diagram of tMoTe$_2$ using local optical spectroscopy and scanning nanoSQUID-on-tip (nSOT) magnetometry. We identify spontaneous ferromagnetism at moir\'e filling factors $\nu = -1$ and $-3$ over a twist angle range from 2.1$^\circ$ to 3.7$^\circ$, revealing a universal, twist-angle-insensitive ferromagnetic phase. At 2.1$^\circ$, we further observe robust ferromagnetism at $\nu = -5$, absent in the devices with larger twist angle -- a signature of the flattening of higher bands in this twist angle range. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal a contrasting twist-angle dependence of the Curie temperatures between $\nu = -1$ and $\nu = -3$, indicating distinct interplay between exchange interaction and bandwidth for the two Chern bands. Despite spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, we find no evidence of a topological gap at $\nu = -3$; however, fragile correlated topological phases could be obscured by the device disorder evident in our spatially resolved measurements. Our results establish a global framework for understanding and controlling magnetic order in tMoTe$_2$ and highlight its potential for accessing correlated topological phases in higher energy Chern band.</description>

      <title>Observation of Superconducting Solitons by Terahertz-Light-Driven Persistent Pseudo-Spin Coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overcoming the decoherence bottleneck remains a central challenge for advancing coherent superconducting quantum device and information technologies. Solitons -- non-dispersive wave packets stabilized by the collective synchronization of quantum excitations -- offer a robust pathway to mitigating dephasing, yet their realization in superconductors has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the observation of a driven soliton state in epitaxial thin films of an iron-based superconductor (Co-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$), induced by intense, multi-cycle terahertz (THz) periodic driving. The dynamical transition to this soliton state is marked by the emergence of Floquet-like spectral sidebands that exhibit a strongly nonlinear dependence on THz laser field strength and a resonant enhancement with temperature. Quantum kinetic simulations corroborate these observations, allowing us to underpin the emergence of synchronized Anderson pseudo-spin oscillations -- analogous to Dicke superradiance -- mediated by persistent order parameter oscillations. In this coherently driven state, the observed sidebands result from difference-frequency mixing between the THz drive and persistent soliton dynamics. These findings establish a robust framework for coherently driving and controlling superconducting soliton time-crystal-like phases using low dissipation, time-periodic THz fields, enabling prospects for THz-speed quantum gate operations, long-lived quantum memory, and robust quantum sensing based on enhanced macroscopic pseudo-spin coherence.</description>

      <title>In-Plane Magnetic Anisotropy and Large topological Hall Effect in Self-Intercalated Ferromagnet Cr1.61Te2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-intercalated chromium tellurides Cr1+xTe2 have garnered growing attention due to their high-temperature ferromagnetism, tunable spin structures and air stability, all of which are vital for versatile applications in next-generation memory and information technology. Here, we report strong magnetic anisotropy and a large topological Hall effect (THE) in self-intercalated Cr1.61Te2 single crystals, which are both highly desirable properties for future spintronic applications. Our results demonstrate that Cr1.61Te2 is a soft ferromagnet with strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Remarkably, distinct THE behaviors are observed in different temperature regimes, reflecting the intricate spin structures and competing exchange interactions. More interestingly, a large topological Hall resistivity, induced by microscopic non-coplanar spin structures, emerges in the temperature range 70-240 K, reaching a maximum value of 0.93 {\mu}{\Omega} cm at 150 K. Moreover, a sign-reversed and weak THE is observed at low temperatures below ~70 K, indicating the emergence of an additional topological spin structure with opposite topological charges. This work not only offers valuable insights into the correlation between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and topological phenomena in Cr1+xTe2 systems, but also provides a robust platform for engineering the evolution of complex spin textures that can be leveraged in diverse spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall effect induced by phonon skew-scattering via orbital magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal transport acts as a powerful tool for studying the excitations and physical properties of insulators, where a charge gap suppresses electronic conduction. Recently, the thermal Hall effect has been observed across various materials, including insulators and semiconductors, but its fundamental origin remains unclear. Here, I propose a promising mechanism to explain the emergence of the thermal Hall effect in these systems: axial chiral phonon skew scattering mediated by orbital magnetization. Starting from basic principles, I derive the form and magnitude of the orbital magnetization-phonon coupling using the well-established Haldane model. Using this coupling, I calculate the thermal Hall conductivity and Hall angle as functions of temperature, achieving semi-quantitative agreement with experimental findings. This work enhances our understanding of the role of electron-phonon coupling in thermal transport and provides a pathway to tailor thermal properties in a broad range of materials.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Bialgebras and Quantum Groups: Algebraic Structures and Tensor Network Realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to define coalgebra and bialgebra structures on two-dimensional (2D) square lattices, extending the algebraic theory of Hopf algebras and quantum groups beyond the one-dimensional (1D) setting. Our construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf algebras and to quantum groups. The approach is further applied to the quantum group $U_q[su(2)]$, for which we construct 2D generalizations of its generators, analyze $q$-deformed singlet states, and derive a 2D R-matrix satisfying an intertwining relation in the semiclassical limit. Additionally, we show how tensor network states, particularly PEPS, naturally induce 2D coalgebra structures when supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions. Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical symmetries in quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel non-equilibrium phase -- the quantum many-body scar (QMBS) phase -- that emerges in non-Hermitian many-body dynamics when scarred wavefunctions are selectively stabilized via non-Hermitian driving. Projective measurements, or non-Hermitian counterparts, preferentially reinforce QMBS, counteracting the entropy growth that drives thermalization. As a result, atypical, high-energy scarred wavefunctions that are negligible in the long-time dynamics of closed systems become non-equilibrium steady states. We establish the existence of the QMBS phase and its sharp, first-order phase transition from an ergodic thermal phase, through both analytical arguments and numerical simulations of three representative models: a random quantum circuit model, the $SU(q)$ spin model, and the paradigmatic spin-1 XY model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a bare-bone random matrix quantum impurity model, by hybridizing a localized spinless electronic level with a bath of random fermions in the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). While stripped out of correlations effects, this model reproduces some salient features of the impurity charge distribution obtained in previous works on interacting disordered impurity models. Computing by numerical sampling the impurity charge distribution in our model, we find a crossover from a Gaussian distribution (centered on half a charge unit) at large hybridization, to a bimodal distribution (centered both on zero and full occupations of the charge) at small hybridization. In the bimodal regime, a universal $(-3/2)$ power-law is also observed. All these findings are very well accounted for by an analytic surmise computed with a single random electron level in the bath. We also derive an exact functional integral for the general probability distribution function of eigenvalues and eigenstates, that formally captures the statistical behavior of our model for any number $N$ of fermionic orbitals in the bath. In the Gaussian regime and in the limit $N\to\infty$, we are able to solve exactly the random matrix theory (RMT) for the charge distribution, obtaining perfect agreement with the numerics. Our results could be tested experimentally in mesoscopic devices, for instance by coupling a small quantum dot to a chaotic electronic reservoir, and using a quantum point contact as local charge sensor for the quantum dot occupation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimensions and critical exponents for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model at five loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We renormalize the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model with an $O(N)$ symmetry to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^5)$ in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimensions and determine the anomalous dimensions of the fermion and scalar fields, $\beta$-functions as well as the scalar field's mass operator. These are used to construct several $N$ dependent critical exponents relevant for quantum transitions in semi-metals and in particular those connected with graphene in three dimensions when $N=2$. Improved exponent estimates for scalar fermion transitions on a honeycomb lattice, when $N=1$, as well as for $N=5$ are also given to compare with results from other techniques such as the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>The multiconfigurational ground state of a diradicaloid characterized at the atomic scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the tip-induced generation and scanning probe characterization of a singlet diradicaloid, consisting of two phenalenyl units connected by an sp-hybridized C$_{4}$ chain, on an ultrathin insulating NaCl surface. The bond-order contrast along the C$_{4}$ chain measured by atomic force microscopy and mapping of charge-state transitions by scanning tunneling microscopy, in conjunction with multiconfigurational calculations, reveal that the molecule exhibits a many-body ground state. Our study experimentally demonstrates the manifestation of strong electronic correlations in the geometric and electronic structures of a single molecule.</description>

      <title>Inducing ferromagnetism by structural engineering in a strongly spin-orbit coupled oxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are essential for the advancement of spin-orbitronic devices, as they enable efficient spin-charge conversion, complex magnetic structures, spin-valley physics, topological phases and other exotic phenomena. 5d transition-metal oxides such as SrIrO3 feature large SOC, but usually show paramagnetic behavior due to broad bands and a low density of states at the Fermi level, accompanied by a relatively low Coulomb repulsion. Here, we unveil ferromagnetism in 5d SrIrO3 thin films grown on SrTiO3 (111). Through substrate-induced structural engineering, a zigzag stacking of three-unit-cell thick layers along the [111] direction is achieved, stabilizing a ferromagnetic state at the interfaces. Magnetotransport measurements reveal an anomalous Hall effect below ~30 K and hysteresis in the Hall conductivity below 7 K, indicating ferromagnetic ordering. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism further supports these results. Theoretical analysis suggests that the structural engineering of the IrO6 octahedral network enhances the density of states at the Fermi level and thus stabilizes Stoner ferromagnetism. This work highlights the potential of structurally engineered 5d oxides for spin-orbitronic devices, where efficient control of SOC-induced magnetic phases by electric currents can lead to lower energy consumption and improved performance in next-generation device technologies.</description>

      <title>Unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring topological matters with exotic quantum states can update the understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single $d$-dimensional ($d$D) system. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Remarkably, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and firstly discover a $3$D unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both second-order (helical) and third-order (corner) topological states in one band gap and exhibits a novel bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Particularly, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>2D CFT and efficient Bethe ansatz for exactly solvable Richardson-Gaudin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work inaugurates a series of complementary studies on Richardson-Gaudin integrable models. We begin by reviewing the foundations of classical and quantum integrability, recalling the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the Richardson (reduced BCS) and Gaudin (central spin) models, and presenting a proof of their integrability based on the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and their generalizations to perturbed affine conformal blocks. Building on this foundation, we then describe an alternative CFT-based formulation. In this approach, the Bethe ansatz equations for these exactly solvable models are embedded within two-dimensional Virasoro CFT via irregular, degenerate conformal blocks. To probe new formulations within the Richardson-Gaudin class, we develop a high-performance numerical solver. The Bethe roots are encoded in the Baxter polynomial, with initial estimates obtained from a secular matrix eigenproblem and subsequently refined using a deflation-assisted hybrid Newton-Raphson/Laguerre algorithm. The solver proves effective in practical applications: when applied to picket-fence, harmonic oscillator, and hydrogen-like spectra, it accurately reproduces known rapidity trajectories and reveals consistent merging and branching patterns of arcs in the complex rapidity plane. We also explain how to generalize our computational approach to finite temperatures, allowing us to calculate temperature-dependent pairing energies and other thermodynamic observables directly within the discrete Richardson model. We propose an application of the solver to Gaudin-type Bethe equations, which emerge in the classical (large central charge) limit of Virasoro conformal blocks. We conclude by outlining future directions: direct minimization of the Yang-Yang function as an alternative root-finding strategy; revisiting time-dependent extensions; and ... .</description>

      <title>Matrix product states as thin torus limits of conformal correlators</title>

Abstract: We introduce one-parameter families of spin chain ansatz wavefunctions constructed from chiral conformal field theory correlators on a torus, with the modular parameter $\tau$ serving as the deformation parameter. In the cylinder limit $\tau\to\infty$, these wavefunctions reduce to infinite dimensional matrix product states. In contrast, in the thin torus limit $\tau\to0$, they become finite bond dimension matrix product states (MPS). Focusing on families derived from the SU(2)$_1$ and SU(2)$_2$ Wess-Zumino-Witten models, we show that in the thin torus limit they reproduce known MPS ground states, such as those of the Majumdar-Ghosh and AKLT spin chains.</description>

      <title>Genuine multipartite entanglement as a probe of many-body localization in disordered spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the quenched average genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) can approach its maximum value in the ergodic phase of a disordered quantum spin model. In contrast, GME vanishes in the many-body localized (MBL) phase, both in equilibrium and in the long-time dynamical steady state, indicating a lack of useful entanglement in the localized regime. To establish this, we analyze the disordered Heisenberg spin chain subjected to a random magnetic field and incorporating two- and three-body Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. We exhibit that the behavior of GME, in both static eigenstates and in dynamically evolved states from an initial Neel configuration, serves as a reliable indicator of the critical disorder strength required for the ergodic-to-MBL transition. The identified transition point aligns well with standard indicators such as the gap ratio and correlation length. Moreover, we find that the presence of DM interactions, particularly the three-body one, significantly stabilizes the thermal phase and delays the onset of localization. This shift in the transition point is consistently reflected in both static and dynamical analyses, reinforcing GME as a robust probe for MBL transitions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the uniform conductivity of a one dimensional degenerate fermion system placed in a random disorder potential so smooth that backward scattering can be neglected. We use the nonlinear Luttinger liquid model to consider effects of both interaction and the curvature of fermionic dispersion. The finite frequency conductivity, calculated in the lowest order of disorder potential, consists of two parts. First one is the elastic contribution, largely independent of temperature and interaction. Second one is the inelastic contribution, strongly dependent on temperature and frequency and appearing upon simultaneous presence of curvature, disorder and interaction. We argue that apart from such finite frequency conductivity, there should always remain the delta function peak of conductivity at zero frequency, whose weight is weakly dependent on the disorder.</description>

      <title>Two-Peak Heat Capacity Accounts for $R\ln(2)$ Entropy and Ground State Access in the Dipole-Octupole Pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08327v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high-quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K are reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However, a second sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, signifying the entrance to the ground state. The ground state appears to have gapped excitations, as even the most abrupt extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K fully accounts for the $R\ln(2)$ entropy associated with the pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$ at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$ for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical spin liquid to a quantum spin liquid (QSL). For both scenarios, comparison of the measured $C_P$ with NLC calculations suggests that weak interactions beyond the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian become relevant below $T \sim 0.25$ K. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI). Together with the peak in the heat capacity at $T_2$, this diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ is suggestive of a classical spin liquid regime above $T_2$ that is distinct from the zero-entropy quantum ground state below $T_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kitaev model, which involves bond-direction-dependent spin interactions on a honeycomb lattice, has attracted significant interest due to its exact solvability and potential uses in quantum computing. A key feature of this model is the half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity (HQTHC) under a magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice; however, HQTHC only appears at low temperatures. Here, in the higher temperature range beyond the HQTHC regime, we theoretically suggest an extrinsic phonon contribution to the thermal Hall effect in the Kitaev model through skew-scattering of chiral phonons by scalar spin chirality, previously examined in Mott insulators. We demonstrate the emergence of scalar spin chirality from fluctuating spins, estimate the resulting field strength and its symmetric form applied to chiral phonons, and obtain the associated thermal Hall conductivity in semi-quantitative agreement with existing experiments. This work offers a fundamental understanding of how spin-phonon interactions influence strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of various properties of quantum field theories is rapidly becoming a testing ground for demonstrating the prowess of quantum algorithms. Some examples include the preparation of ground states, as well as the investigation of various simple wave packets relevant for scattering phenomena. In this paper, we study the ability of quantum algorithms to prepare ground states in a matter-free non-Abelian $SO(3)$ lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D in a phase where the global charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is challenging for two reasons: the necessity of dealing with a large Hilbert space for gauge theories compared to that of quantum spin models, and the closing of the gap between the two ground states, which becomes exponentially small as a function of the volume. To deal with the large Hilbert space of gauge fields, we demonstrate how the exact imposition of the non-Abelian Gauss Law in the rishon representation of the quantum link operator significantly reduces the degrees of freedom. Further, to resolve the gap, we introduce symmetry-guided ans\"{a}tze in the Gauss-Law-resolved basis for trial states as the starting point for the quantum algorithms to prepare the two lowest energy states. In addition to simulation results for a range of two-dimensional system sizes, we also provide experimental results from the trapped-ion-based quantum hardware, IonQ, when working on systems with four quantum links. The experimental/simulation results derived from our theoretical developments indicate the role of metrics--such as the energy and the infidelity--to assess the obtained results.</description>

This framework is only build on several fundamental facts in quantum mechanics, while providing a novel, rigorous, and self-contained theory of statistics. Our definition of statistics can be computed directly using a computer, and the result aligns with existing physical theories.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides remarkable insights into the real space properties of many-body systems, but does not directly reveal the nature of their fundamental excitation spectrum. Here, we demonstrate that radio-frequency spectroscopy can reveal the quasi-particle nature of doped quantum many-body systems, crucial for our understanding of, e.g., high-temperature superconductors. In particular, we showcase how the existence and energy of magnetic polaron quasi-particles in doped Fermi-Hubbard systems may be probed, revealed by hallmark peaks in the spectroscopic spectrum. In combination with fundamental dualities of the Fermi-Hubbard model, we describe how these findings may be tested using several experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Effective perpendicular electric field as a probe for interlayer pairing in ambient-pressure superconducting La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films</title>

Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments on La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films have revealed a superconducting gap near the diagonal direction for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, confined to a narrow momentum region. Our numerical calculations indicate that interlayer pairing is dominant, resulting in an $s_\pm$-wave symmetry. We propose employing perpendicular electric fields, a practical method in thin film systems, to verify the pairing symmetry. Our calculations predict that such fields will induce Fermi arcs or nodal points and significantly modulate the gap near the diagonal, with the modulated region overlapping the area probed by ARPES. This approach provides an effective tool for probing pairing symmetry in bilayer nickelate thin films, especially given current limitations in experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fragmented Dopant Dynamics in Quantum Spin Lattices: Robust Localization and Sub-diffusion</title>

Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.</description>

      <title>Shallow quantum circuit for generating O(1)-entangled approximate state designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17871</link>

Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega(\log (t/\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, which improves the runtime of a state certification task by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and queries.</description>
