      <title>Metastability and ripening of multi-component liquid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how multi-component liquid mixtures undergo phase separation is central to elucidating biophysical organization in the cell. Here, combining analytical and numerical results, we characterise the dynamics of mixtures with disordered interactions among the components. We first study how two coexisting phases become unstable, leading to multiphase coexistence. We then show that the scaling of droplet radius as $t^{1/3}$ and droplet number as $n^{-2/3}$, characteristic of Ostwald ripening in two dimensions, can be severely delayed. This delay arises from glass-like relaxation and the emergence of long-lived metastable states characterized by different wetting angles.</description>

      <title>Sculpting 2D Crystals via Membrane Contractions before and during Solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When phospholipids crystallize within the otherwise fluid membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles, the resulting molecularly-thin "2D" solids exhibit great variety in their morphology evolution. For instance within membranes containing moderate amounts of the crystallizing component, crystals grow with a fixed morphology depending on vesicle size. Conversely for membranes containing large amounts of the crystallizing species, we find small compact crystals on vesicles of all sizes. However on large vesicles, growing crystals sprout flower petals that lengthen progressively. These behaviors result from two combined mechanisms: First, like other 2D solids, the shear rigidity of phospholipid crystals renders them intolerant to morphologies with non-zero Gaussian curvature. As a result and especially at elevated membrane tension, the cost of bending elasticity is reduced, at the expense of line energy, by the formation of flowers as opposed to compact crystals. Second, the composition-dependent tension rise during cooling relaxes via water permeation of the membrane with a time constant scaling as $R^2$. The amount of crystal formed for a small decrease in temperature determines this composition-dependent increase in stress from thermal contractions versus solidification. Surface Evolver computations motivated using the predicted tension evolution to develop a processing space that maps to experimental observations for initial and growing crystal morphology. Important variable groups are identified, including a scaled ratio of bending to line energy, a vesicle size-independent group for membrane contractions, and a time constant for stress relaxation. Though processing stresses ultimately relax, the crystal morphology persists well beyond the processing window.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law for Sequence-Induced Demixing of Compositionally Identical Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical incompatibility of polymers with different compositions scales inversely with their length. For instance, a mixture of A and B homopolymers of length $N$ segregates at $\chi_{AB}^{cr} = 2/N$. But what if the difference between the blend components is subtler? We demonstrate that a mixture of AB copolymers with identical composition -- equal amounts of A and B monomers -- but different primary sequences can still phase separate. Incompatibility arises from distinct positional correlations between monomers of different chains. Calculating the Gaussian fluctuation correction to the free energy reveals that critical incompatibility from sequence differences follows a distinct yet universal scaling with chain length, $\chi_{AB}^{cr} \sim 1 / \sqrt{N}$. This power law holds for both regular-sequence and statistical copolymers. A closed-form expression is derived for blends of block-alternating chains. The new theoretical scaling is confirmed by coarse-grained simulations, offering important insights into multiphase coexistence in biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Probing Anharmonic and Heterogeneous Carrier Dynamics Across Sublattice Melting in a Minimal Model Superionic Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the microscopic origin of sublattice melting and fast ion transport in superionic conductors remains elusive. Here, we introduce a chemically neutral minimal binary model consisting of a rigid host lattice stabilized by short-range steric repulsion and a soft carrier sublattice interacting via long-range Wigner-type forces. This contrast naturally produces distinct melting temperatures and an intermediate sublattice-melting phase in which carriers become fluidlike while the host remains crystalline. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify three dynamical regimes-crystalline, sublattice-melt, and fully molten-marked by sharp changes in diffusivity, structural correlations, and dynamic heterogeneity. Near sublattice melting, carrier motion is strongly anharmonic and spatially heterogeneous, beyond mean-field hopping descriptions. By tuning the density, we demonstrate that sublattice melting can be continuously controlled, establishing a direct link between lattice softness, anharmonicity, and collective ion transport. This work provides a unified microscopic foundation for designing mechanically robust, high-performance superionic conductors operable near ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Huygens' clocks at the microscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly coupled oscillators adjust their dynamics to work in unison: they synchronize. This ubiquitous phenomenon is observed for oscillating pendulum, electronic devices, as well as clapping crowds or flashing fireflies. In effect, synchronization constitutes an efficient mean to translate microscopic into large scale dynamics. While broadly studied theoretically, experimental investigations of synchronization of systems at the microscale are limited. Here we devise and study a model system of noisy and "measurably imperfect" colloidal oscillators: autonomous clocks made of an active swimmer revolving around a passive sphere. The distribution of natural frequency of the clock is achieved using passive spheres of various sizes, thus without altering the (phoretic) coupling between clocks. We observe that pairs of oscillators lock phases before slipping and returning to sync, and we characterize the synchronicity of the pair. We rationalize our findings with a stochastic model, formalizing synchronization as a classical Kramers escape problem in an adequate potential. This provides an analytical expression for the rate of synchronization of a pair set by the ratio between differences of natural frequency and environmental noise, and agrees qualitatively with the experiment. Our results set a blueprint for synchronization with micrometric autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Boundary compliance selects heterogeneous dynamics in shear-thickening suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of confining boundaries can fundamentally alter the flow behaviour of shear-thickening suspensions. We study a dense cornstarch suspension sheared beneath a viscous silicone-oil layer, using the oil viscosity to tune boundary compliance. Flow visualisation and rheometry reveal two distinct regimes. With compliant boundaries, long-lived heterogeneities emerge via density waves or persistent clusters, maintained by a balance between interface deformation and particle rearrangement. With more resistant confinement, we observe transient jamming events, marked by abrupt spanning of load-bearing structures across the suspension thickness and the emergence of secondary stress waves. The onset stress of these events remains constant at the DST threshold, independent of bounding viscosity. Our results reveal that boundary compliance selects the lifetime and morphology of heterogeneous structures, offering a means to amplify otherwise short-lived microscopic processes and providing new insight into the interplay between shear thickening, shear jamming, and confinement mechanics.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Superposition Rheometry of soft core-shell microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms of flow in suspensions of soft particles above the glass-transition volume fraction and in the jammed state were probed using Orthogonal Superposition Rheometry (OSR). A small amplitude oscillatory shear flow is superimposed orthogonally onto a steady shear flow, which allows monitoring the viscoelastic spectra of sheared jammed core-shell microgels during flow. The characteristic crossover frequency {\omega}c, deduced from the viscoelastic spectrum, provides information about the shear induced structural relaxation time, which is connected to the microscopic yielding mechanism of cage breaking. The shear rate evolution of the crossover frequency is used to achieve a superposition of all spectra and get a better insight of the flow mechanism. Despite their inherent softness, the hybrid core-shell microgels exhibit similarities with hard sphere-like flow behavior, with the main difference that for the microgels the transition from a glassy to a jammed state introduces a volume fraction dependence of the scaling of {\omega}c with shear rate. We further check the application of the Kramers-Kronig relations on the experimental low strain amplitude OSR data finding a good agreement. Finally, the low frequency response at high strain rates was investigated with open bottom cell geometry and instrumental limits were identified. Based on these limits, we discuss previous OSR data and findings in repulsive and attractive colloidal glasses, and compared them with the current soft particle gels.</description>

      <title>Vortex formation in the Vicsek model with internal chirality of self-propelling objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effect of internal chirality on collective motion of large number of active objects is studied by simulations of appropriately modified Vicsek model. We add a fixed angle to the noise and consider small ratios, p,
  between this angle and the maximal deviation from the average local direction of motion.
  When the above ratio is p=1/120, the traveling bands observed with the symmetrical noise are
  destroyed, and small bands moving in different directions
  appear. Circular rotating flocks of objects with the same orientation are formed for p=1/7.5. Stable vortexes in the stationary state were found from p=1/60
  to p=1/20. Velocity autocorrelation function shows equilibrium between the inflow and the outflow to and from the vortex. Long-time evolution is significantly influenced by a temporary trapping of the objects in the vortex. The ballistic behavior for the symmetrical noise changes to the diffusive
  behavior for the chirality leading to the onset of vortexes.</description>

      <title>Geometry and dynamical morphology of growing bacterial colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-equilibrium bacterial colony growth using a geometry-first, time-resolved analysis of morphology. From time-lapse microscopy data, we track the coupled evolution of area, perimeter, and boundary-sensitive shape descriptors along the full growth history. We find that non-equilibrium growth can exhibit extended intervals of compact area--perimeter scaling with exponent $\alpha \approx 2$, consistent with growth governed by a single effective geometric length scale, as well as time-localized breakdowns of this scaling during ongoing growth. These breakdowns coincide with transient boundary reorganization while bulk area growth remains sustained. Our results demonstrate that visually distinct morphologies can arise within the same geometric growth regime, and that departures from single-scale behavior reflect intrinsic dynamical restructuring rather than growth arrest. More broadly, this work establishes time-resolved geometry as a coarse-grained framework for identifying when non-equilibrium growth departs from single-scale geometric constraints in living systems.</description>

      <title>Broadening the temperature range of blue phases using $azo$ compounds of various molecular geometries assembled from modular "LEGO" molecular units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature range of the blue phases (BPs) formed in highly chiral mixtures based on cholesteryl oleyl carbonate (COC) and the nematic liquid crystal E7 was studied in the presence of various chemical structures. The $azo$ compounds used were of both chiral and achiral nature, and their molecular geometry was modified by substitution of modular "LEGO" molecular units of varying alkyl chain lengths and types of bridging groups, which could substantially affect the mesomorphic properties of the matrix mixture. It was shown that in many cases these dopants effectively broadened the BP temperature range. This effect depends on both the variation in the molecular geometry of the $azo$ compounds and the increase in the $cis$-isomer concentration under UV irradiation. The presence of the $cis$-isomers formed have a stronger impact on broadening the BP temperature range than the initial $trans$-isomers. These results demonstrate that the temperature range of BPs can be precisely controlled via a combination of molecular engineering and $trans$-$cis$ photo-isomerization.</description>

      <title>Constraints on stability and renormalization group flows in nonequilibrium matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive constraints on renormalization group (RG) flows and stability of phases in nonequilibrium systems using quantum information inequalities. These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

Abstract: The study by Jung et al. (Jung H, Covino R, Arjun A, et al., Nat Comput Sci. 3:334-345 (2023)) introduced Artificial Intelligence for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), a novel sampling algorithm that integrates machine learning to enhance the efficiency of transition path sampling (TPS). By enabling on-the-fly estimation of the committor probability and simultaneously deriving a human-interpretable reaction coordinate, AIMMD offers a robust framework for elucidating the mechanistic pathways of complex molecular processes. This commentary provides a discussion and critical analysis of the core AIMMD framework, explores its recent extensions, and offers an assessment of the method's potential impact and limitations.</description>

      <title>Buckling mediated by mobile localized elastic excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments reveal that structural transitions in thin sheets are mediated by the passage of transient and stable mobile localized elastic excitations. These ``crumples'' or ``d-cones'' nucleate, propagate, interact, annihilate, and escape. Much of the dynamics occurs on millisecond time scales. Nucleation sites correspond to regions where generators of the ideal unstretched surface converge. Additional stable intermediate states illustrate two forms of quasistatic inter-crumple interaction through ridges or valleys. These interactions create pairs from which extended patterns may be constructed in larger specimens. The onset of localized transient deformation with increasing sheet size is correlated with a characteristic stable crumple size, whose measured scaling with thickness is consistent with prior theory and experiment for localized elastic features in thin sheets. We offer a new theoretical justification of this scaling.</description>

      <title>Statistics within UV-Visible Absorption Spectrum of Ethanolic Azobenzene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a statistical simulation of the UV--visible absorption spectrum of {\it trans}-azobenzene in ethanol solution. Due to intermolecular interactions, the used explicit solvent environment necessitates accounting for numerous transitions for a spectrum covering the two energetically lowest lines, S$_1$ and S$_2$. Furthermore, the spectrum manifests vast variation as a function of the underlying local structure, in conjunction with previous observations for spectra of liquids in the X-ray regime. We disentangle the complex structure--spectrum relationship using a machine learning-based method known as the emulator-based component analysis. This structural decomposition outperforms commonly used principal component analysis in explained spectral variation and reveals a small subset of latent structural variables responsible for the total spectral variance. Among other structural characteristics, blueshifting of the S$_2$ peak occurs with fewer hydrogen bonds with the ethanol solvent, and a contracted N=N bond within the C--N=N--C bridge. The observed structural dependence of the absorption spectrum thus implies an overrepresentation of certain structural classes after a photoexcitation, potentially significant for the subsequent nuclear dynamics, photophysics, and photochemistry.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.</description>
