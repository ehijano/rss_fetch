      <title>Informational analysis of the confinement of an electron in an asymmetric double quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-unidimensional one-electron double quantum dot is studied within the framework of Shannon informational entropy. Its confinement potential, which is described by an asymmetric harmonic-gaussian function, consists of two wells separated by a potential barrier, and the asymmetry of the potential in respect to the center of the barrier is parameterized by $x_0$. In this work we employ Shannon informational entropy as a tool to investigate changes in the electronic confinement resulting from the modifications in the degree of asymmetry $x_0$. In particular, we notice that Shannon entropy turns out to be very sensitive to the change from the symmetric to the antisymmetric regime. Moreover, we show that Shannon entropy as a function of $x_0$ for an electronic excited state displays an irregular behavior whenever the state energy is in the vicinity of a local extreme (a maximum or a minimum); connected with this we observe an oscillatory behavior of the energy of the excited states as a function of $x_0$.</description>

      <title>International comparison of optical frequencies with transportable optical lattice clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical clocks have improved their frequency stability and estimated accuracy by more than two orders of magnitude over the best caesium microwave clocks that realise the SI second. Accordingly, an optical redefinition of the second has been widely discussed, prompting a need for the consistency of optical clocks to be verified worldwide. While satellite frequency links are sufficient to compare microwave clocks, a suitable method for comparing high-performance optical clocks over intercontinental distances is missing. Furthermore, remote comparisons over frequency links face fractional uncertainties of a few $10^{-18}$ due to imprecise knowledge of each clock's relativistic redshift, which stems from uncertainty in the geopotential determined at each distant location. Here, we report a landmark campaign towards the era of optical clocks, where, for the first time, state-of-the-art transportable optical clocks from Japan and Europe are brought together to demonstrate international comparisons that require neither a high-performance frequency link nor information on the geopotential difference between remote sites. Conversely, the reproducibility of the clocks after being transported between countries was sufficient to determine geopotential height offsets at the level of 4 cm. Our campaign paves the way for redefining the SI second and has a significant impact on various applications, including tests of general relativity, geodetic sensing for geosciences, precise navigation, and future timing networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Resonant Laser Isotope Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method for efficient isotope separation is proposed. It is based on efficient photoionization of atoms by a continuous-wave laser using resonant-enhancement in an ultra-large volume optical cavity. This method should enable higher efficiency than the existing state of the art and could be used as an alternative to radiochemistry. It should also allow separation of radioisotopes that are not amenable to standard radiochemistry, with important implications for medicine.</description>

      <title>Engineering propagating cat states with driving-assisted cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for generating optical cat states in propagating pulses based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme uses multiple four-level systems (4LSs) inside an optical cavity as an emitter. Time-modulating driving stimulates the emitter to produce a superposition of coherent states entangled with the 4LSs. The postselection of an appropriate state of the 4LSs leads to a multicomponent cat state in a propagating pulse. Taking atomic decay and cavity loss into account, we optimize the cavity external loss rate to maximize the fidelity. We find that its optimum value is formulated similarly to that of other generation methods for propagating states, which suggests a universal property of cavity-QED systems interacting with fields outside the cavity.</description>

      <title>Rotational excitation in sympathetic cooling of diatomic molecular ions by laser-cooled atomic ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sympathetic cooling of molecular ions through the Coulomb interaction with laser-cooled atomic ions is an efficient tool to prepare translationally cold molecules. Even at relatively high collisional energies of about 1eV (T$\sim$10000K), the nearest approach in the ion-ion collisions never gets closer than $\sim$1nm such that naively perturbations of the internal molecular state are not expected. The Coulomb field may, however, induce rotational transitions changing the purity of initially quantum state prepared molecules. Here, we use estimates of rotational state changes in collisions of diatomic ions with atomic ions (arXiv:1905.02130) and determine the overall rotational excitation accumulated over the sympathetic cooling. We also estimate the cooling time, considering both a single atomic ion and a Coulomb crystal of atomic ions.</description>

      <title>Fast and reliable atom transport by optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable single atoms have drawn significant attention for their potentials as flying quantum memory in non-local, dynamic quantum computing architectures. However, when dynamic optical tweezers are employed to control atoms opto-mechanically, conventional methods such as adiabatic controls and constant jerk controls are either inherently slow or induce mechanical heating, leading to atom loss over long distances or at high speeds. To address these challenges, we explore the method known as shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) as an efficient alternative for fast and reliable atom transport control. We present a series of proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating that STA-based optical tweezer trajectories can achieve both rapid and reliable single-atom transport. These experiments include moving atoms between two locations, adjusting speeds en route, and navigating curved trajectories. Our results indicate that atoms can be transported with a constant acceleration on average over distances that is only limited by trap lifetime, while effectively suppressing vibrational heating. This makes STA methods particularly well-suited for long-distance atom transport, potentially spanning distances over centimeter scales, such as between quantum information devices.</description>

      <title>The Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope: an instrument for characterization of Auger electron multiplicities and energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a new instrument, the Argonne Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope (ARM), capable of characterizing the Auger-Meitner electron emission of radionuclides, including candidates relevant in nuclear medicine. Our approach relies on event-by-event coincidence ion, electron time-of-flight and spatial readout measurement to determine correlated electron multiplicity and energy distributions of Auger-Meitner decays. We present a proof-of-principle measurement with the ARM using X-ray photoionization of stable krypton beyond the K-edge and identify a bifurcation in the electron multiplicity distribution depending on the emission of K-LX electrons. Extension of the ARM to the characterization of radioactive sources of Auger-Meitner electron emissions is enabled by the combination of two recent developments: (1) cryogenic buffer gas beam technology, which enables well-defined initial conditions, gas-phase, high activity introduction of Auger-Meitner emitters into the detection region, and (2) large-area micro-channel plate detectors with multi-hit detection capabilities, which enables the simultaneous detection of many electrons emitted in a single decay.
  The ARM will generate new experimental data on Auger-Meitner multiplicities that can be used to benchmark atomic relaxation and decay models. As the multiplicities are binned by energy, this data will provide insight into the low-energy regime of Auger-Meitner electrons where intensity calculations are most challenging and experimental data is limited. In particular, accurate multiplicity data of the low-energy regime can be used to inform oncological dosimetry models, where electron energies less than 500 eV are known to be effective in damaging DNA and cell membranes.</description>

      <title>Superradiance-assisted two-color Doppler cooling of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For experiments that require a quantum system to be in the ultra-cold regime, laser cooling is an essential tool. While techniques for laser cooling ions and neutral atoms have been refined and temperatures below the Doppler limit have been achieved, present-day techniques are limited to a small class of molecules. This paper proposes a general cooling scheme for molecules based on vibrational-state transitions. Superradiance is used to speed up the two-photon transition. Simulations of this scheme achieve temperatures comparable to those achieved by existing two-level schemes for neutral atoms and ions.</description>

      <title>Rotational state changes in collisions of diatomic molecular ions with atomic ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.02130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate rotational state changes in a single collision of diatomic molecular ions, both polar and apolar, with an atomic ion. These may occur when sympathetically cooling trapped molecular ions by co-trapped laser-cooled atomic ions, since the electric field due to the atom may excite molecular rotations. Thanks to the different time and energy scales of translational and rotational motion, we may treat the collision classically and describe rotations quantum mechanically. Based on numerical calculations for a number of examples, we derive closed-form estimates for the rotational excitation per collision, depending on the scattering energy and the molecular parameters.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability in the Born approximation. The resultant errors are around $20 \ \%$ for Ar and $60 \ \%$ for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The transition is dominated by the outermost shell electrons. The error for Xe atom will become better for high energy because of the approximation and lack of data.</description>
