      <title>Multicategorical Adjoints, Monadicity, and Quantum Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the third part of a program aimed at building a unified operadic and multicategorical foundation for operator theory and quantum processes. Building on the multicategory HilbMult and the previously introduced Synergy Operad, we investigate the intrinsic algebraic structure underlying compositional quantum dynamics. Three main themes are developed. First, we introduce n-adjoints, a hierarchy of generalized adjoint operations that extend classical adjoints to multicategorical settings and capture higher-order operator interactions. We prove a multicategorical version of Stinespring's theorem formulated in terms of n-adjoints. Second, we study the algebraic semantics of quantum processes and show that completely positive trace-preserving maps admit a canonical monadic description. In particular, we prove a monadicity theorem identifying quantum processes, up to operadic operational equivalence, with algebras of a synergy monad induced by a symmetric quantum interaction operad, yielding a faithful representation that uniformly accounts for sequential and parallel composition. Third, we present an algebraic formulation of quantum no-go principles by encoding constraints such as the no-cloning theorem as operadic ideals. Together, these results provide a coherent algebraic framework that unifies operator theory, category theory, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Hochschild cohomology via cohomology of categories, and incidence algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hochschild cohomology of diagrams of algebras introduced by Gerstenhaber and Schack and provide computations for filtrations of incidence algebras. Our aims are threefold: firstly, we revisit and explore the connection between the Gerstenhaber-Schack complexes and the Baues-Wirsching cohomology of categories. Secondly, we analyse the behaviour of (diagrammatic) Hochschild cohomology in the context of homological epimorphisms of algebras. Thirdly, we study diagrams of incidence algebras. In particular, as a main application, we compute the diagrammatic Hochschild cohomology of diagrams of incidence algebras associated to finite filtrations of simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Relative operads model $\infty$-operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a (colored) operad and a set of unary operations, we can form an associated $\infty$-operad via localization. We show that localization determines an equivalence of homotopy theories of relative operads and $\infty$-operads. As an application, we give an affirmative answer to an open question by Harpaz, proving that Lurie's operadic nerve functor determines an equivalence of homotopy theories of simplicial operads and Lurie's $\infty$-operads.</description>

      <title>(Pointed) Univalence in Universe Category Models of Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a formulation of the univalence axiom in a universe category model of dependent type theory that is convenient to verify in homotopy-theoretic settings. We further develop a strengthening of the univalence axiom, called pointed univalence, that is both computationally desirable and semantically natural, and verify its closure under Artin-Wraith gluing and formation of inverse diagrams.</description>

      <title>Monoidal Quantaloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how to add a symmetric monoidal structure to quantaloids in a compatible way. In particular, dagger compact quantaloids turn out to have properties that are similar to the category Rel of sets and binary relations. Examples of such quantaloids are the category qRel of quantum sets and binary relations, and the category V-Rel of sets and binary relations with values in a commutative quantale V. For both examples, the process of internalization structures is of interest. Discrete quantization, a process of generalization of mathematical structures to the noncommutative setting can be regarded as the process of internalizing these structures in qRel, whereas fuzzification, the process of introducing degrees of truth or membership to concepts that are traditionally considered either true or false, can be regarded as the process of internalizing structures in V-Rel. Hence, we investigate how to internalize power sets and preordered structures in dagger compact quantaloids.</description>

      <title>The Universal Property of Measure-Theoretic Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on work of Chen, we give a universal property of the Markov category BorelStoch of standard Borel spaces and Markov kernels between them. To do this, we introduce a new notion of *coinflip*, or unbiased binary choice, in a Markov category. These are unique if they exist, and automatically preserved by all Markov functors which preserve coproducts. We also provide universal characterizations of various Markov categories of discrete kernels.</description>

      <title>On the Hopf envelope of finite-dimensional bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being right perfect as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced. Remarkably, the machinery we develop also allows us to give a new description of the Hopf envelope of a commutative bialgebra and of the cofree cocommutative Hopf algebra of a cocommutative bialgebra.</description>
