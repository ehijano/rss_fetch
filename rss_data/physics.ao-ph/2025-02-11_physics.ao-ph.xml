      <title>Descriptor: Five years of meteorological surface data at Oak Ridge Reserve in Tennessee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to continuous, quality assessed meteorological data is critical for understanding the climatology and atmospheric dynamics of a region. Research facilities like Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) rely on such data to assess site-specific climatology, model potential emissions, establish safety baselines, and prepare for emergency scenarios. To meet these needs, on-site towers at ORNL collect meteorological data at 15-minute and hourly intervals. However, data measurements from meteorological towers are affected by sensor sensitivity, degradation, lightning strikes, power fluctuations, glitching, and sensor failures, all of which can affect data quality. To address these challenges, we conducted a comprehensive quality assessment and processing of five years of meteorological data collected from ORNL at 15-minute intervals, including measurements of temperature, pressure, humidity, wind, and solar radiation. The time series of each variable was pre-processed and gap-filled using established meteorological data collection and cleaning techniques, i.e., the time series were subjected to structural standardization, data integrity testing, automated and manual outlier detection, and gap-filling. The data product and highly generalizable processing workflow developed in Python Jupyter notebooks are publicly accessible online. As a key contribution of this study, the evaluated 5-year data will be used to train atmospheric dispersion models that simulate dispersion dynamics across the complex ridge-and-valley topography of the Oak Ridge Reservation in East Tennessee.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in stratified rotating topographic wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence generation mechanisms in stratified, rotating flows past three-dimensional (3D) topography remain underexplored, particularly in submesoscale (SMS) regimes critical to geophysical applications. Using turbulence-resolving large-eddy simulations, we systematically dissect the interplay of stratification and rotation in governing the dynamics of wake turbulence. Our parametric study reveals that turbulent dissipation in the near wake is dominated by two distinct instabilities: (1) vertical shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), amplified by oblique dislocation of K\'arm\'an vortices under strong stratification, and (2) centrifugal/inertial instability (CI), which peaks at intermediate rotation rates (Rossby number order unity, SMS regime) and relatively weaker stratification. Notably, strong rotation dampens vertical shear and weakens KHI-driven turbulence, while strong stratification imposes smaller vertical length scales that restrict CI-driven turbulence. By quantifying dissipation across a broad parameter space of stratification and rotation, predictive relationships between the environmental parameters and instability dominance is established. These findings highlight the regime dependence of instability mechanisms and may inform targeted observational campaigns and numerical models of oceanic and atmospheric wakes.</description>

      <title>Marine spatial planning techniques with a case study on wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As emerging marine technologies lead to the development of new infrastructure across the ocean, they enter an environment that existing ecosystems and industries already rely on. Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of \$56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of \$9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</description>
