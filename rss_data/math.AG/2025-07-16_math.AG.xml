      <title>Formal models for relative adic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Raynaud's theory of formal models from rigid-analytic spaces over a nonarchimedean field to uniform qcqs adic spaces $X$, with no finite-type assumptions, over an arbitrary Tate affinoid base $S$. The key new ingredient is the notion of a normalized formal blow-up which takes on the role played by admissible formal blow-ups in the classical theory.</description>

      <title>On the Tschirnhausen module of coverings of curves on decomposable ruled surfaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for two classes of $m$-secant curves $X \subset S$, with $m \geq 2$, where $f : S = \mathbb{P} (\mathcal{O}_Y \oplus \mathcal{O}_Y (E)) \to Y$ and $E$ is a non-special divisor on a smooth curve $Y$, the Tschirnhausen module $\mathcal{E}^{\vee}$ of the covering $\varphi = f_{|_X} : X \to Y$ decomposes completely as a direct sum of line bundles. Specifically, we prove that: for $X \in |\mathcal{O}_S (mH)|$, where $H$ denotes the tautological divisor on $S$, one has $
\mathcal{E}^{\vee} \cong \mathcal{O}_Y (-E) \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathcal{O}_Y (-(m-1)E) $; for $X \in |\mathcal{O}_S (mH + f^{\ast}q))|$, where $q$ is a point on $Y$, $
  \mathcal{E}^{\vee} \cong \mathcal{O}_Y (-E-q) \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathcal{O}_Y (-(m-1)E-q) $
holds. This decomposition enables us to compute the dimension of the space of global sections of the normal bundle of the embedding $X \subset \mathbb{P}^R$ induced by the tautological line bundle $|\mathcal{O}_S (H)|$, where $R = \dim |\mathcal{O}_S (H)|$. As an application, we construct new families of generically smooth components of the Hilbert scheme of curves, including components whose general points correspond to non-linearly normal curves, as well as nonreduced components.</description>

      <title>Lifting derived equivalences of abelian surfaces to generalized Kummer varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the $G$-autoequivalences of the derived category $\mathbf{D}^b_G(A)$ of $G$-equivariant objects for an abelian variety $A$ with $G$ being a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{Pic}^0(A)$. We provide a result analogue to Orlov's short exact sequence for derived equivalences of abelian varieties. It can be generalized to the derived equivalences of abelian varieties for a same $G$ in general. Furthermore, we find derived equivalences of generalized Kummer varieties by lifting derived equivalences of abelian surfaces using the $G$-equivariant version of Orlov's short exact sequence and some ``splitting" propositions.</description>

      <title>The Integral Chow Rings of the Moduli Stacks of Hyperelliptic Prym Pairs II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series devoted to describing the integral Chow ring of the moduli stacks $\mathcal{RH}_g$ of hyperelliptic Prym pairs. For fixed genus $g$, the stack $\mathcal{RH}_g$ is the disjoint union of $\lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$ components $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ for $n = 1, \ldots, \lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$. In this paper, we compute the integral Chow rings of the components $\mathcal{RH}_g^{(g+1)/2}$ for odd $g$. Along the way, we also determine the integral Chow ring of the moduli stack of unordered pairs of two divisors in $\mathbb{P}^1$ of the same even degree.</description>

      <title>On maximal curves of $n$-correct sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $\mathcal{X}$ is an $n$-correct set of nodes in the plane, that is, it admits a unisolvent interpolation with bivariate polynomials of total degree less than or equal to $n.$ Then an algebraic curve $q$ of degree $k\le n$ can pass through at most $d(n,k)$ nodes of $\Xset,$ where $d(n,k)={{n+2}\choose {2}}-{{n+2-k}\choose {2}}.$ A curve $q$ of degree $k\le n$ is called maximal if it passes through exactly $d(n,k)$ nodes of $\mathcal{X}.$ In particular, a maximal line is a line passing through $d(n,1)=n+1$ nodes of $\mathcal{X}.$ Maximal curves are an important tool for the study of $n$-correct sets. We present new properties of maximal curves, as well as extensions of known properties.</description>

      <title>Linear representations of the mapping class group of dimension at most $3g-3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify representations of the mapping class group of a surface of genus $g$ (with at most one puncture or boundary component) up to dimension $3g-3$. Any such representation is the direct sum of a representation in dimension $2g$ or $2g+1$ (given as the action on the (co)homology of the surface or its unit tangent bundle) with a trivial representation. As a corollary, any linear system on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ in this range is of algebro-geometric origin.</description>

      <title>Density of solutions for systems of forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero over which every diagonal form in sufficiently many variables admits a nontrivial solution. For example, $K$ may be a totally imaginary number field or a finite extension of a $p$-adic field. Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ are forms of degree $d$ over $K.$ Bik, Draisma and Snowden recently proved that there exists a constant $B = B(d,s,K)$ such that the rational solutions to the system of equations $f_1=\ldots=f_s = 0$ are Zariski dense, as long as the Birch rank of $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ is greater than $B.$ We establish an effective bound for this constant. Combined with results of Skinner, we obtain as a corollary a sufficient condition for the integer zeros of a system of forms over a number field to satisfy the Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic with a positive leading term. This corollary generalizes a seminal result proved by Schmidt for the rational numbers.</description>

      <title>Satake's good basic invariants for finite complex reflection groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2004.01871 Satake introduced the notions of admissible triplets and good basic invariants for finite complex reflection groups. For irreducible finite Coxeter groups, he showed the existence and the uniqueness of good basic invariants. Moreover he showed that good basic invariants are flat in the sense of K.Saito's flat structure. He also obtained a formula for the multiplication of the Frobenius structure. In this article, we generalize his results to finite complex reflection groups. We first study the existence and the uniqueness of good basic invariants. Then for duality groups, we show that good basic invariants are flat in the sense of the natural Saito structure constructed in arXiv:1612.03643. We also give a formula for the potential vector fields of the multiplication in terms of the good basic invariants. Moreover, in the case of irreducible finite Coxeter groups, we derive a formula for the potential functions of the associated Frobenius manifolds.</description>

      <title>Unramified Grothendieck-Serre for isotropic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grothendieck-Serre conjecture predicts that every generically trivial torsor under a reductive group $G$ over a regular semilocal ring $R$ is trivial. We establish this for unramified $R$ granted that $G^{\mathrm{ad}}$ is totally isotropic, that is, has a "maximally transversal" parabolic $R$-subgroup. We also use purity for the Brauer group to reduce the conjecture for unramified $R$ to simply connected $G$--a much less direct such reduction of Panin had been a step in solving the equal characteristic case of Grothendieck-Serre. We base the group-theoretic aspects of our arguments on the geometry of the stack $\mathrm{Bun}_G$, instead of the affine Grassmannian used previously, and we quickly reprove the crucial weak $\mathbb{P}^1$-invariance input: for any reductive group $H$ over a semilocal ring $A$, every $H$-torsor $\mathscr{E}$ on $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ satisfies $\mathscr{E}|_{\{t = 0\}} \simeq \mathscr{E}|_{\{t = \infty\}}$. For the geometric aspects, we develop reembedding and excision techniques for relative curves with finiteness weakened to quasi-finiteness, thus overcoming a known obstacle in mixed characteristic, and show that every generically trivial torsor over $R$ under a totally isotropic $G$ trivializes over every affine open of $\mathrm{Spec}(R) \setminus Z$ for some closed $Z$ of codimension $\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Symplectic Automorphisms of Supersingular K3 surfaces in Odd Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2009, Dolgachev-Keum showed that finite groups of tame symplectic automorphisms of K3 surfaces in positive characteristics are subgroups of the Mathieu group of degree 23. In this paper, we utilize lattice-theoretic methods to investigate symplectic actions of finite groups G on K3 surfaces in odd characteristics. For supersingular K3 surfaces with Artin invariants at least two, we develop a new machinery called p-root pairs to constrain possible symplectic finite group actions (without the assumption of tameness). The concept of p-root pair is closely related to root systems and Weyl groups. In particular, we provide alternative proof for many results by Dolgachev-Keum and give an upper bound for the exponent of p in |G|.</description>

      <title>Towards a characterization of toric hyperk\"{a}hler varieties among symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X, \omega)$ be a conical symplectic variety of dimension $2n$ which has a projective symplectic resolution. Assume that $X$ admits an effective Hamiltonian action of an $n$-dimensional algebraic torus $T^n$, compatible with the conical $\mathbf{C}^*$-action. A typical example of $X$ is a toric hyperkahler variety $Y(A,0)$.
  In this article, we prove that this property characterizes $Y(A,0)$ with $A$ unimodular. More precisely, if $(X, \omega)$ is such a conical symplectic variety, then there is a $T^n$-equivariant (complex analytic) isomorphism $\varphi: (X, \omega) \to (Y(A,0), \omega_{Y(A,0)})$ under which both moment maps are identified. Moreover $\varphi$ sends the center $0_X$ of $X$ to the center $0_{Y(A,0)}$ of $Y(A,0)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the stabilized symplectic embedding problem for four-dimensional ellipsoids into the four-dimensional round ball. The answer is neatly encoded by a piecewise smooth function which exhibits a phase transition from an infinite Fibonacci staircase to an explicit rational function related to symplectic folding. Our approach is based on a bridge between quantitative symplectic geometry and singular algebraic curve theory, and a general framework for approaching both topics using scattering diagrams. In particular, we construct a large new family of rational algebraic curves in the complex projective plane with a (p,q) cusp singularity, many of which solve the classical minimal degree problem for plane curves with a prescribed cusp. A key role is played by the tropical vertex group of Gross--Pandharipande--Siebert and ideas from mirror symmetry for log Calabi--Yau surfaces. Many of our results also extend to other target spaces, e.g. del Pezzo surfaces and more general rational surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Given a family of varieties, the Euler discriminant locus distinguishes points where Euler characteristic differs from its generic value. We introduce a hypergeometric system associated with a flat family of very affine locally complete intersection varieties. It is proven that the Euler discriminant locus is its singular locus and is purely one-codimensional unless it is empty. Of particular interest is a family of very affine hypersurfaces. We coin the term hypergeometric discriminant for the characteristic cycle of the hypergeometric system and establish a formula in terms of likelihood equations.</description>

      <title>Spectral Fingerprints of Algebraic Cycles: A Hodge-Theoretic Approach to the Hodge Conjecture and Special L-Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces and develops the "Spectral Fingerprint Philosophy" for detecting algebraic cycles on complex algebraic varieties, particularly K3 surfaces. This framework proposes that algebraic cycles can be revealed through intrinsic Hodge-theoretic and arithmetic data, leveraging the algebraic structure of period relations, Picard-Fuchs differential equations, and special values of motivic L-functions. The methodology extends to $(k,k)$-Hodge cycles on higher-dimensional K\"ahler manifolds, formulating a general criterion that links vanishing linear combinations of periods (interpreted as "spectral fingerprints") to the algebraicity of cycles and the arithmetic of corresponding L-functions. This perspective reframes the Hodge Conjecture as a statement about the algebraicity of spectral data within the variation of Hodge structures. A key contribution is the proposal and proof of a novel algebraic divisor on the Kummer K3 surface $X_{-1}$, which arises from complex multiplication (CM) on the elliptic curve $E_{2}(-1)$. By explicitly analyzing the period structure of $X_{-1}$, a non-trivial linear relation among period integrals, constituting the spectral fingerprint of this divisor, is derived. This result exemplifies how CM relations induce additional Hodge cycles and illustrates the broader philosophy behind spectral criteria for algebraicity, grounding the theory in established mathematical results and presenting concrete examples through case studies of genus-2 Riemann surfaces and Kummer K3 surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we study conic divisorial ideals of toric rings. We provide an idea to determine them and we give a description of the conic divisorial ideals of Hibi rings and stable set rings of perfect graphs by using this idea. We also characterize when Hibi rings or stable set rings are quasi-symmetric or weakly-symmetric. Moreover, by using the description of the conic divisorial ideals, we construct a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of a special family of stable set rings.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the Witten conjecture through spectral curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Witten conjecture, which connects a descendent enumerative theory with a specific reduction of KP integrable hierarchy. Our conjecture is realized by two parts: Part I (Geometry) establishes a correspondence between the geometric descendent potential (apart from ancestors) and the topological recursion of specific spectral curve data $(\Sigma, x,y)$; Part II (Integrability) claims that the TR descendent potential, defined at the boundary points of the spectral curve (where $dx$ has poles), is a tau-function of a certain reduction of the multi-component KP hierarchy.
  In this paper, we show the geometric part of the conjecture for any formal descendent theory by using a generalized Laplace transform. Subsequently, we prove the integrability conjecture for the one-boundary cases. As applications, we generalize and prove the $r$KdV integrability of negative $r$-spin theory conjectured by Chidambaram, Garcia-Failde and Giacchetto. We also show the KdV integrability of the total descendent potential associated with the Hurwitz space $M_{1,1}$, whose Frobenius manifold was initially introduced by Dubrovin.</description>

      <title>On t-structures adjacent and orthogonal to weight structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $t$-structures (on triangulated categories) that are closely related to weight structures.
  A $t$-structure couple $t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0})$ is said to be adjacent to a weight structure $w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0})$ if $C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}$.
  For a category $C$ that satisfies the Brown representability property we prove that $t$ that is adjacent to $w$ exists if and only if $w$ is smashing (that is, "respects C-coproducts"). The heart $Ht$ of this $t$ is the category of those functors $Hw^{op}\to Ab$ that respect products (here $Hw$ is the heart of $w$); the result has important applications.
  We prove several more statements on constructing $t$-structures starting from weight structures; we look for a strictly orthogonal $t$-structure $t$ on some $C'$ (where $C,C'$ are triangulated subcategories of a common $D$) such that $C'_{t\le 0}$ (resp. $C'_{t\ge 0}$) is characterized by the vanishing of morphisms from $C_{w\ge 1}$ (resp. $C_{w\le -1}$). Some of these results generalize properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions proved in the previous paper, and can be applied to various derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$ that is projective over an affine noetherian one. We also study hearts of orthogonal $t$-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal $t$-structures.</description>

      <title>Singular algebraic curves and infinite symplectic staircases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the infinite staircases which arise in the ellipsoid embedding functions of rigid del Pezzo surfaces (with their monotone symplectic forms) can be entirely explained in terms of rational sesquicuspidal symplectic curves. Moreover, we show that these curves can all be realized algebraically, giving various new families of algebraic curves with one cusp singularity. Our main techniques are (i) a generalized Orevkov twist, and (ii) the interplay between algebraic $\Q$-Gorenstein smoothings and symplectic almost toric fibrations. Along the way we develop various methods for constructing singular algebraic (and hence symplectic) curves which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>More varieties of 4-d gauge theories: product representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we used methods of arithmetic geometry to study the anomaly-free irreducible representations of an arbitrary gauge Lie algebra. Here we generalize to the case of products of irreducible representations, where it is again possible to give a complete description. A key result is that the projective variety corresponding to $m$-fold product representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}_n$ is a rational variety for every $m$ and $n$. We study the simplest case of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ (corresponding to the strong interaction) in detail. We also describe the implications of a number-theoretic conjecture of Manin (and related theorems) for the number of chiral representations of bounded size $B$ (measured roughly by the Dynkin labels) compared to non-chiral ones, giving a precise meaning to the sense in which the former (which are those most relevant for phenomenology) are rare compared to the latter. As examples, we show that, for both irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{su}_5$ and once-reducible product representations of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ that are non-anomalous, the number of chiral representations is asymptotically between $B (\log B)^5$ and $B^\frac{4}{3}$, while the number of non-chiral representations is asymptotically $B^2$. Despite this rarity of chiral, anomaly-free, product representations, we show that there are examples relevant for phenomenology, including one that gives an asymptotically-free gauge theory with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}_7$.</description>

      <title>The residual monodromy for the Dwork family in even characteristic and its applications to Galois representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the residual monodromy representations associated to the Dwork family in characteristic two. Various applications involving 2-adic and mod 2 Galois representations are discussed. Combining the author's previous work with Tsuzuki and recent results of Boxer, Calegari, Gee, and Pilloni, we also prove the automorphy of certain rank 4 symplectic motives over a totally real field, arising from the Dwork quintic family, under suitable conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-theory levels in physics and math</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to describe the basics of a dictionary between Chern-Simons levels in three-dimensional gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) and the (coincidentally-named) Ruan-Zhang levels for twisted quantum K-theory in mathematics. Each defines a twisting of quantum K-theory, and our proposed dictionary identifies these two twistings, in the cases of projective spaces, Grassmannians, and flag manifolds. We verify the dictionary by realizing the Coulomb branch equations as symbols of certain differential operators annihilating a twisted version of the I function associated to the abelianized GLSM theory, and also by comparing the geometric window for Chern-Simons levels to an analogous window for the Ruan-Zhang levels. In the process, we interpret the geometric window for the Chern-Simons levels in terms of equalities of I and J functions. This provides a fuller mathematical understanding of some special cases in the physics literature. We also make conjectures for twisted quantum K-theory of gerbes, following up earlier conjectures on ordinary quantum K-theory of gerbes.</description>
