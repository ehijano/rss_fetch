      <title>Bessel beam fabrication of graphitic micro electrodes in diamond using laser bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the fabrication of conductive graphitic microelectrodes in diamond by using pulsed Bessel beams in the burst mode laser writing regime. The graphitic wires are created in the bulk of a 500 {\mu}m thick monocrystalline HPHT diamond (with (100) orientation) perpendicular to the sample surface, without beam scanning or sample translation. In particular, the role of different burst features in the resistivity of such electrodes is investigated for two very different sub-pulse durations namely 200 fs and 10 ps, together with the role of thermal annealing. Micro-Raman spectroscopy is implemented to investigate the laser-induced crystalline modification, and the results obtained by using two different laser repetition rates, namely 20 Hz and 200 kHz, are compared. A comparison of the micro-Raman spectra and of the resistivity of the electrodes fabricated respectively with 10 ps single pulses and with bursts (of sub-pulses) of similar total duration has also been made, and we show that the burst mode writing regime allows to fabricate more conductive micro electrodes, thanks to the heat accumulation process leading to stronger graphitization. Moreover, the microfabrication of diamond by means of the longest available bursts (~ 46.7 ps duration) featured by 32 sub-pulses of 200 fs duration, with intra-burst time delay of 1.5 ps (sub-THz bursts), leads to graphitic wires with the lowest resistivity values obtained in this work, especially at low repetition rate such as 20 Hz. Indeed, micro electrodes with resistivity on the order of 0.01 {\Omega} cm can be fabricated by Bessel beams in the burst mode regime even when the bursts are constituted by femtosecond laser sub-pulses, in contrast with the results of the standard writing regime with single fs pulses typically leading to less conductive micro electrodes.</description>

      <title>A Space Group Symmetry Informed Network for O(3) Equivariant Crystal Tensor Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the prediction of general tensor properties of crystalline materials, including dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic tensors. A key challenge here is how to make the predictions satisfy the unique tensor equivariance to O(3) group and invariance to crystal space groups. To this end, we propose a General Materials Tensor Network (GMTNet), which is carefully designed to satisfy the required symmetries. To evaluate our method, we curate a dataset and establish evaluation metrics that are tailored to the intricacies of crystal tensor predictions. Experimental results show that our GMTNet not only achieves promising performance on crystal tensors of various orders but also generates predictions fully consistent with the intrinsic crystal symmetries. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).</description>

      <title>Wide-bandgap semiconductor of three-dimensional unconventional stoichiometric NaCl2 crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expanding applications call for novel new-generation wide-bandgap semiconductors. Here, we show that a compound only composed of the ordinary elements Na and Cl, namely three-dimensional NaCl2 crystal, is a wide-bandgap semiconductor. This finding benefits from the breaking of conventional stoichiometry frameworks in the theoretical design, leading to the discovery of three-dimensional XY2 (X = Na, Li, K; Y = Cl, F, Br, I) crystals, with covalent bonds of Y pairs inducing the wide bandgap from 2.24 to 4.45 eV. Crucially, such an unexpected NaCl2 crystal was successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. The unconventional stoichiometric strategy with other chemical elements potentially yields more wide-bandgap semiconductors, offering the capability for bandgap tuning. These unconventional stoichiometric materials may also exhibit superconductivity, transparent inorganic electrides, high-energy-density, and beyond.</description>

      <title>A variational method for the simulation of hydrogen diffusion in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for the approximate solution of the strongly coupled, nonlinear stress-diffusion problem that appears when modeling hydrogen transport in metals. The most salient feature of the proposed approximation is that it is fully variational, meaning that all the discrete equations are obtained from the optimality conditions of an incremental potential, even for inelastic mechanical behavior. Like other variational methods, the proposed algorithm has remarkable properties, including the symmetry of the tangent operator, making its solution extremely efficient compared to other similar methods available in the literature.</description>

      <title>The importance of definitions in crystallography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper was motivated by the articles "Same or different - that is the question" in CrystEngComm (July 2020) and "Change to the definition of a crystal" in the IUCr newsletter (June 2021). Experimental approaches to crystal comparisons require rigorously defined classifications in crystallography and beyond. Since crystal structures are determined in a rigid form, their strongest equivalence in practice is rigid motion, which is a composition of translations and rotations in 3-dimensional space. Conventional representations based on reduced cells and standardizations theoretically distinguish all periodic crystals. However, all cell-based representations are inherently discontinuous under almost any atomic displacement that can arbitrarily scale up a reduced cell. Hence comparing millions of known structures in materials databases needs continuous distance metrics.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Photoplasticity in ZnS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ZnS is a brittle material but shows extraordinary plasticity during mechanical tests performed in complete darkness. This phenomenon is known as the photoplastic effect, whose underlying mechanisms have long been unclear. We study the impact of light, via photoexcited charge carriers, on the dislocation core structure and mobility using first-principles calculations. We calculate the core structure and the charge-dependent Peierls barriers of the glide set of Shockley partial dislocations in ZnS. Our findings reveal that locally charged dislocations capture excess carriers in the system, leading to core reconstructions that alter the Peierls barrier, resulting in higher barriers and lower mobility for these dislocations. This altered and asymmetric mobility, depending on dislocation character (edge or mixed) and local stoichiometry (Zn or S rich), is responsible for the brittle behavior of ZnS under light exposure and will be reversed in complete darkness.</description>

      <title>Size Effect of Negative Capacitance State and Subthreshold Swing in Van der Waals Ferrielectric Field-Effect Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical calculations corroborated by the finite element modelling show that thin films of Van der Waals ferrielectrics covered by a 2D-semiconductor are promising candidates for the controllable reduction of the dielectric layer capacitance due to the negative capacitance (NC) effect emerging in the ferrielectric film. The NC state is conditioned by energy-degenerated poly-domain states of the ferrielectric polarization induced in the films under incomplete screening conditions in the presence of a dielectric layer. Calculations performed for the FET-type heterostructure "ferrielectric CuInP2S6 film - 2D-MoS2 single-layer - SiO2 dielectric layer" reveal the pronounced size effect of the multilayer capacitance. Derived analytical expressions for the electric polarization and multilayer capacitance allow to predict the thickness range of the dielectric layer and ferrielectric film for which the NC effect is the most pronounced in various Van der Waals ferrielectrics, and the corresponding subthreshold swing becomes much less than the Boltzmann's limit. Obtained results can be useful for the size and temperature control of the NC effect in the steep-slope ferrielectric FETs.</description>

      <title>Influence of the coating brittleness on the thermomechanical fatigue behavior of a $\beta$-NiAl coated R125 Ni-based superalloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brittleness of an aluminide diffusion coating protecting a Ren\'e 125 Ni-based polycrystalline superalloy was investigated over a wide range of temperatures in its as-received and thermally aged form. Isothermal and thermal cycled aging were performed on the coated system at a maximum temperature of 1100 {\deg}C. Microstructure evolutions and damage initiation within the coating were characterized. Interrupted tensile tests and thermomechanical fatigue tests were conducted to document critical stress-strain conditions leading to the coating cracking and lifetime for the case of thermo-mechanical fatigue loading. Advanced digital image correlation and acoustic emission techniques were used to detect coating cracking. Isothermal oxidation or cyclic oxidation led to improved strain-to-failure due to metallurgical evolutions and also longer fatigue life under thermomechanical fatigue conditions.</description>

      <title>Electric field enhances the electronic and diffusion properties of penta-graphene nanoribbons for application in lithium-ion batteries: a first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the electronic and diffusion properties of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for improving the performance of the fast-growing energy storage devices. Here we use first principles methods with density functional theory and the climbing image-nudged elastic band method to evaluate the impact of an external electric field on the stability, electronic and diffusion properties of penta-graphene nanoribbons upon lithium adsorption. We show that by adsorbing a lithium atom, these semiconductor nanoribbons become metal with a formation energy of -0.22 (eV). The diffusion coefficient of this material is five orders of magnitude higher than that of a common carbon graphite layer. Under a relatively small vertical electric field, these lithium-ion systems are even more stable, and their diffusion coefficient is enhanced significantly of 711 times higher than that of the material in the absence of an applied electric field and 520 times higher than in the case of commercial graphitic carbon layers. Our results highlight the role of an external electric field as a novel switch to improve the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries with penta-graphene nanoribbon electrodes and open a new horizon for the use of more environmentally friendly pentagonal materials as electrode materials in lithium-ion battery industry.</description>

      <title>Can it be detected? A computational protocol for evaluating MOF-metal oxide chemiresistive sensors for early disease detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human breath contains over 3000 volatile organic compounds, abnormal concentrations of which can indicate the presence of certain diseases. Recently, metal-organic framework (MOF)-metal oxide composite materials have been explored for chemiresistive sensor applications, however their ability to detect breath compounds associated with specific diseases remains unknown. In this work, we present a new high-throughput computational protocol for evaluating the sensing ability of MOF-metal oxide towards small organic compounds. This protocol uses a cluster-based method for accelerated structure relaxation, and a combination of binding energies and density-of-states analysis to evaluate sensing ability, the latter measured using Wasserstein distances. We apply this protocol to the case of the MOF-metal oxide composite material NM125-TiO2 and show that it is consistent with previously reported experimental results for this system. We examine the sensing ability of NM125-TiO2 for over 100 human-breath compounds spanning 13 different diseases. Statistical inference then allows us to identifies ones which subsequent experimental efforts should focus on. Overall, this work provides new tools for computational sensor research, while also illustrating how computational materials science can be integrated into the field of preventative medicine.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Influence of Hydrogen on BCC Iron Grain Boundaries using the Kinetic Activation Relaxation technique (k-ART)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge in the mechanical integrity of iron and its alloys. This study explores the influence of hydrogen atoms on two distinct grain boundaries (GBs), $\Sigma37$ and $\Sigma3$, in body-centered-cubic (BCC) iron. Using the kinetic activation-relaxation technique (k-ART), an off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo approach, we examine diffusion barriers and mechanisms associated with these GBs. Our findings reveal distinct behaviors of hydrogen in different GB environments, emphasizing the elastic deformation that arises around the GB in the presence of H that leads to either the predominance of new pathways and diffusion routes or a pinning effect of H atoms. We find that, for these systems, while GB is energetically favorable for H, this element diffuses more slowly at the GBs than in the bulk. Moreover, with detailed information about the evolution landscape around GB, we find that the saturation of a GB with hydrogen both stabilizes the GB by shifting barriers associated with Fe diffusion to higher energies and smooths the energy landscape, reducing the number of diffusion events. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of hydrogen's role in GB behavior, contributing valuable insights for the design and optimization of materials in hydrogen-related applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal pre-train/fine-tune strategies for accurate material property predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overcoming the challenge of limited data availability within materials science is crucial for the broad-based applicability of machine learning within materials science. One pathway to overcome this limited data availability is to use the framework of transfer learning (TL), where a pre-trained (PT) machine learning model (on a larger dataset) can be fine-tuned (FT) on a target (typically smaller) dataset. Our study systematically explores the effectiveness of various PT/FT strategies to learn and predict material properties with limited data. Specifically, we leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to PT/FT on seven diverse curated materials datasets, encompassing sizes ranging from 941 to 132,752 datapoints. We consider datasets that cover a spectrum of material properties, ranging from band gaps (electronic) to formation energies (thermodynamic) and shear moduli (mechanical). We study the influence of PT and FT dataset sizes, strategies that can be employed for FT, and other hyperparameters on pair-wise TL among the datasets considered. We find our pair-wise PT-FT models to consistently outperform models trained from scratch on the target datasets. Importantly, we develop a GNN framework that is simultaneously PT on multiple properties (MPT), enabling the construction of generalized GNN models. Our MPT models outperform pair-wise PT-FT models on several datasets considered, and more significantly, on a 2D material band gap dataset that is completely out-of-distribution from the PT datasets. Finally, we expect our PT/FT and MPT frameworks to be generalizable to other GNNs and materials properties, which can accelerate materials design and discovery for various applications.</description>

      <title>LLMatDesign: Autonomous Materials Discovery with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering new materials can have significant scientific and technological implications but remains a challenging problem today due to the enormity of the chemical space. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled data-driven methods to rapidly screen or generate promising materials, but these methods still depend heavily on very large quantities of training data and often lack the flexibility and chemical understanding often desired in materials discovery. We introduce LLMatDesign, a novel language-based framework for interpretable materials design powered by large language models (LLMs). LLMatDesign utilizes LLM agents to translate human instructions, apply modifications to materials, and evaluate outcomes using provided tools. By incorporating self-reflection on its previous decisions, LLMatDesign adapts rapidly to new tasks and conditions in a zero-shot manner. A systematic evaluation of LLMatDesign on several materials design tasks, in silico, validates LLMatDesign's effectiveness in developing new materials with user-defined target properties in the small data regime. Our framework demonstrates the remarkable potential of autonomous LLM-guided materials discovery in the computational setting and towards self-driving laboratories in the future.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional magnets: Forgotten history and recent progress towards spintronic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of two-dimensional magnetic order in van-der Waals materials has stimulated a renaissance in the field of atomically-thin magnets. This has led to promising demonstrations of spintronic functionality such as tunneling magnetoresistance. The frantic pace of this emerging research, however, has also led to some confusion surrounding the underlying phenomena of phase transitions in two-dimensional (2D) magnets. In fact, there is a rich history of experimental precedents beginning in the 1960s with quasi-2D bulk magnets and progressing to the 1980s using atomically-thin sheets of elemental metals. This review provides a holistic discussion of the current state of knowledge on the three distinct families of low-dimensional magnets: quasi-2D, ultra-thin films and van-der Waals crystals. It highlights the unique opportunities presented by the latest implementation in van-der Waals materials. By revisiting the fundamental insights from the field of low-dimensional magnetism, this review will highlight factors that can be used to enhance material performance. For example, the limits imposed on the critical temperature by the Mermin-Wagner theorem can be escaped in three separate ways: magnetocrystalline anisotropy, long range interactions and shape anisotropy. Several recent experimental reports of atomically-thin magnets with Curie temperatures above room temperature are highlighted.</description>

Abstract: Energy sustainability and interconnectivity are the two main pillars on which cutting-edge architecture is based and require the realisation of energy and intelligent devices that can be fully integrated into buildings, capable of meeting stringent regulatory requirements and operating in real-world conditions. Luminescent solar concentrators, particularly those based on near-infrared emitting reabsorption-free quantum dots, are considered good candidates for the realisation of semi-transparent photovoltaic glazing, but despite important advances in optical property engineering strategies, studies of finished devices suitable for real-world operation are still lacking. In this paper, we demonstrate the first example of a fully assembled quantum dot luminescent solar concentrator-based photovoltaic glazing that meets all international standards for photovoltaic and building elements. We also show that these devices are capable of functioning as efficient Visible Light Communication (VLC) receivers even under full sunlight, thus combining energy and wireless connectivity functions in a realistic solution for smart, sustainable buildings.</description>

      <title>Solution-dependent electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) ZnO thin film growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study describes a facile route of zinc oxide (ZnO) grows using the solution-dependent electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) method at temperatures ranging from 300 {\deg}C - 500 {\deg}C. In this work, zinc chloride (ZnCl2) was dissolved in ethanol (CH3CH2OH) to prepare the 0.1 M concentration of 20 ml for spray solution by ESD. Adding different deionized water (H2O) ratio, three different solutions were prepared. The results reveal that adding H2O ration, suppressing the c-axis crystal growth of ZnO thin films. The adhesion of anions was believed to be responsible for this suppression. XRD texture analysis examined the preferred orientations of the (100) and (002) planes of the ZnO thin films. Microstructural parameters namely, lattice parameters, bond length, positional parameters, full width at half maximum, crystallite sizes, lattice strain, and lattice dislocation density, are investigated. This research marks a turning point in cost-effective industrial and commercial applications for ESD-deposited electronics.</description>

      <title>Lewis Acidity and Basicity Diagnostics of Molten Salt for its Properties and Structure Online Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogous to the aqueous solution where the pH of the solvent affects its multiple behaviors, the Lewis acidity-basicity of molten salts also greatly influences their thermophysical and thermochemical properties. In the study, we develop ion probes to quantitatively determine the acidity-basicity scale of molten NaCl-xAlCl3 (x = 1.5-2.1) salt using in-situ ultra-violet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. With the accumulation of acidity-basicity data of NaCl-AlCl3 molten salt for a variety of compositions, the correlation between the acidity-basicity of salt and its measured fundamental properties are derived. To understand the physical and chemical features controlling the acidity-basicity variations, the structures of NaCl-xAlCl3 molten salts with different chemical compositions are investigated in terms of bonded complexes and coordination numbers. The comprehensive understanding of the correlation between composition, acidity-basicity, properties, and structures of molten salt can serve for the full screening and online monitoring of salt melt in extreme environments by simply measuring the salt acidity-basicity as developed in this study.</description>

      <title>Magnetism-induced second-order nonlinear optical responses in multiferroic BiFeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) responses of noncentrosymmetric nonmagnets have drawn a lot of attention in the past decades because of their significance in materials characterization, green energy and device applications. However, the magnetism-induced NLO responses have rarely been studied so far. In this paper, we first extend the numerical calculation friendly formula by Rashkeev $\textit{et al.}$ [Phys. Rev. B $\textbf{57}$, 3905 (1998)] for second harmonic generation (SHG) in nonmagnetic materials to include magnetic systems and then calculate the magnetism-induced NLO responses of BiFeO$_3$, a multiferroic that exhibits both ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at room temperature and has a band gap that falls in the visible frequency region. First, we find that the calculated magnetism-induced SHG susceptibilities are large and the SHG intensity is tunable with the reversal of magnetization. In particular, we find a strong magnetic contrast of the SHG signal of approximately 440% at SHG photon energy of 4.82 eV, thus enabling a magnetic control of the SHG in BiFeO$_3$. Also, because of the sensitivity of the SHG signal to the direction of the N\'eel vector, the SHG can be utilized to detect the reversal of the N\'eel vector in the AFM materials, which is an important issue for AFM spintronics. Second, the calculated BPVE in BiFeO$_3$ are also strong, being larger than some well-known NLO compounds such as BaTiO$_3$, GaAs, CdS and CdSe. Finally, we analyse the origins of the prominent features in the NLO response spectra in terms of the calculated quantum geometric quantities. Our interesting findings suggest that the magnetism-driven NLO responses in BiFeO$_3$ are significant, anisotropic and tunable, and that understanding the magnetism-driven components of both SHG and BPVE is essential for their applications in, e.g., multiferroic-based photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectricity in Amorphous Hafnium Oxide (HfO$_2$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, inherent in all materials, offers a promising alternative to piezoelectricity for nanoscale actuation and sensing. However, its widespread application faces significant challenges: differentiating flexoelectric effects from those of piezoelectricity and other phenomena, verifying its universality across all material structures and thicknesses, and establishing a comprehensive database of flexoelectric coefficients across different materials. This work introduces a groundbreaking methodology that accurately isolates flexoelectricity from piezoelectric, electrostrictive and electrostatic effects, with a detection threshold extending below 1 fC/m. The robustness of this method is demonstrated through its application to amorphous hafnium oxide (HfO$_2$), successfully measuring a flexoelectric coefficient of 105 $\pm$ 10 pC/m. This measurement signifies the first measurement of flexoelectricity in hafnia, as well as in any amorphous material. Additionally, the study compiles a list of published flexoelectric coefficients, revealing an important insight. The relationship between the flexoelectric coefficient and the material's relative permittivity is better approximated by a quadratic proportionality. This challenges the traditional linear assumption proposed in Kogan's work and opens new avenues for future research in flexoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Connecting Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions to inversion asymmetry in perovskite oxide heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inversion asymmetry, combined with spin orbit interaction, leads to Rashba or Dresselhaus effects, or combinations of them that are promising for technologies based on antiferromagnetic spintronics. Since understanding the exact nature of spin-orbit interaction is crucial for developing a technology based on it, mapping the nature of inversion asymmetry with the type of spin-orbit interaction becomes the key. We simulate a perovskite oxide heterostructure LaAlO$_3|$SrIrO$_3|$SrTiO$_3$ preserving the inversion symmetry within density functional theory to demonstrate the relation between the nature of inversion asymmetry and the corresponding Rashba or Dresselhaus-type interaction. With progressive distortion in the heterostructure, we find how the structure inversion asymmetry sets in with distorted bond lengths and bond angles, leading to Rashba effect in the system. Further, introduction of tilted IrO$_6$ octahedra leads to bulk inversion asymmetry, helping a combined Rashba-Dresselhaus interaction to set in. A comparison of the spin textures obtained from our DFT calculations and theoretical modeling helps us identify the exact nature of the interactions. Besides demonstrating the connection between the nature of asymmetry with Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, our work may serve as a guide to identifying different types of Rashba-like spin-orbit interactions.</description>

      <title>Predicting BN analogue of 8-16-4 graphyne: \textit{In silico} insights into its structural, electronic, optical, and thermal transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boron nitride (BN) analogue of 8-16-4 graphyne, termed SBNyne, is proposed for the first time. Its physical properties were explored using first-principles calculations and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Thermal stability assessments reveal that SBNyne maintains structural integrity up to 1000 K. We found that SBNyne exhibits a wide indirect bandgap of 4.58 eV using HSE06 and 3.20 eV using PBE. It displays strong optical absorption in the ultraviolet region while remaining transparent in the infrared and visible regions. Additionally, SBNyne exhibits significantly lower thermal conductivity compared to h-BN. Phonon spectrum analysis indicates that out-of-plane phonons predominantly contribute to the vibrational density of states only at very low frequencies, explaining its low thermal conductivity. These findings expand the knowledge of BN-based 2D materials and open new avenues for their design and advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>A higher-dimensional geometrical approach for the classification of 2D square-triangle-rhombus tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Square-triangle-rhombus ($\mathcal{STR}$) tilings are encountered in various self-organized multi-component systems. They exhibit a rich structural diversity, encompassing both periodic tilings and long-range ordered quasicrystals, depending on the proportions of the three tiles and their orientation distributions. We derive a general scheme for characterizing $\mathcal{STR}$ tilings based on their lift into a four-dimensional hyperspace. In this approach, the average hyperslope ($2 \times 2$) matrix $\mathcal{H}$ of a patch defines its global composition with four real coefficients: $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$, $\mathcal{Z}$, and $\mathcal{W}$. The matrix $\mathcal{H}$ can be computed either directly from the area-weighted average of the hyperslopes of individual tiles or indirectly from the border of the patch alone. The coefficient $\mathcal{W}$ plays a special role as it depends solely on the rhombus tiles and encapsulates a topological charge, which remains invariant upon local reconstructions in the tiling. For instance, a square can transform into a pair of rhombuses with opposite topological charges, giving rise to local modes with five degrees of freedom. We exemplify this classification scheme for $\mathcal{STR}$ tilings through its application to experimental structures observed in two-dimensional Ba-Ti-O films on metal substrates, demonstrating the hyperslope matrix $\mathcal{H}$ as a precise tool for structural analysis and characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present electrical and thermal transport measurements in single crystals of the metallic oxide RuO$_2$. The resistivity and Seebeck coefficient measured up to 970K confirm the metallic nature of transport. Magnetoresistance and Hall effect measurements as a function of orientation can be most easily described by a multiband transport model. We find that the ordinary Hall effect dominates any anomalous Hall signal in single crystals.</description>

      <title>Electric field manipulation of magnetization in an insulating dilute ferromagnet through piezoelectromagnetic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report magnetization changes generated by an electric field in ferromagnetic Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Two classes of phenomena have been revealed. First, over a wide range of magnetic fields, the magnetoelectric signal is odd in the electric field and reversible. Employing a macroscopic spin model and atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory with Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate that the magnetoelectric response results from the inverse piezoelectric effect that changes the trigonal single-ion magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Second, in the metastable regime of ferromagnetic hystereses, the magnetoelectric effect becomes non-linear and irreversible in response to a time-dependent electric field, which can reorient the magnetization direction. Interestingly, our observations are similar to those reported for another dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor Cr$_x$(Bi$_{1-y}$Sb$_y$)$_{1-x}$Te$_3$, in which magnetization was monitored as a function of the gate electric field. Those results constitute experimental support for theories describing the effects of time-dependent perturbation upon glasses far from thermal equilibrium in terms of an enhanced effective temperature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy oxides (HEO)s have garnered much interest due to their available high degree of tunability. Here, we study the local structure of (MgNiCuCoZn)0.167(MnCr)0.083O, a composition based on the parent HEO (MgNiCuCoZn)0.2O.We synthesized a series of thin films via pulsed laser deposition at incremental oxygen partial pressures. X-ray diffraction shows lattice parameter to decrease with increased pO2 pressures until the onset of phase separation. X-ray absorption fine structure shows that specific atomic species in the composition dictate the global structure of the material as Cr, Co, and Mn shift to energetically favorable coordination with increasing pressure. Transmission electron microscopy analysis on a lower-pressure sample exhibits a rock salt structure, but the higher-pressure sample reveals reflections reminiscent of the spinel structure. In all, these findings give a more complete picture on how (MgNiCuCoZn)0.167(MnCr)0.083O forms with varying initial conditions and advances fundamental knowledge of cation behavior in high entropy oxides.</description>

      <title>Relative Time-of-Flight Measurement in an Ultrafast Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts to push the spatiotemporal imaging-resolution limits of femtosecond (fs) laser-driven ultrafast electron microscopes (UEMs) to the combined angstrom-fs range will benefit from stable sources capable of generating high bunch charges. Recent demonstration of unconventional off-axis photoemitting geometries are promising, but connections to the observed onset of structural dynamics are yet to be established. Here we use the in-situ photoexcitation of coherent phonons to quantify the relative time-of-flight (r-TOF) of photoelectron packets generated from the Ni Wehnelt aperture and from a Ta cathode set-back from the aperture plane. We further support the UEM experiments with particle-tracing simulations of the precise electron-gun architecture and photoemitting geometries. In this way, we measure discernable shifts in electron-packet TOF of tens of picoseconds for the two photoemitting surfaces. These shifts arise from the impact the Wehnelt-aperture off-axis orientation has on the electron-momentum distribution, which modifies both the collection efficiency and the temporal-packet distribution relative to on-axis emission. Future needs are identified; we expect this and other developments in UEM electron-gun configuration to expand the range of materials phenomena that can be directly imaged on scales commensurate with fundamental structural dynamics.</description>

Abstract: A recent breakthrough has been achieved by synthesizing monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC), which introduces a material with unique optoelectronic properties. Here, we used ab initio (DFT) molecular dynamics simulations to study silicon and germanium MAC analogs. Typical unit cells contain more than 600 atoms. We also considered their corresponding nanotube structures. The cohesion energy values for MASi and MAGe range from -8.41 to -7.49 eV/atom and follow the energy ordering of silicene and germanene. Their electronic behavior varies from metallic to small band gap semiconductors. Since silicene, germanene, and MAC have already been experimentally realized, the corresponding MAC-like versions we propose are within our present synthetic capabilities.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that in spin injection experiments the interplay between external magnetic field and alternating current can be observed already on a single ferromagnet/normal metal interface. The interface resistance is predicted to exhibit prominent features whenever the frequency of spin precession in the applied field becomes equal to the frequency of the driving current. Using these features, material-specific g-factors of electrons in normal metals can be measured with less effort, albeit also with less precision.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization in twisted altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of altermagnetism, twistronics and valleytronics is of great significance for potential applications in advanced electronic devices. Twisted magnetic van der Waals bilayers have been identified as an ideal platform for altermagnetism of any type, such as $d$-wave, $g$-wave, and $i$-wave, by choosing the constituent monolayer with specific symmetry [arXiv:2404.17146 (2024)]. Here, we propose a way for achieving valley polarization in twisted altermagnetism by applying out-of-plane external electric field. Since the out-of-plane electric field creates a layer-dependent electrostatic potential, the valleys form different layers will stagger, producing valley polarization. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed way using the twisted tight-binding model. It is found that the applied electric field can also induce valley/spin-gapless semiconductor and half metal besides valley polarization. Based on first-principles calculations, our proposed way to achieve valley polarization can be verified in twisted bilayer VOBr and monolayer $\mathrm{Ca(CoN)_2}$ as a special twisted altermagnet. These findings provide new opportunities for innovative spintronics, twistronics and valleytronics applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic Self-Organization in the \beta -Pyrochlore Oxide CsW2O6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, I present the electronic properties of the beta-pyrochlore oxide CsW2O6 and other related materials. At 215 K, CsW2O6 exhibits an electronic phase transition to a nonmagnetic insulating state, which exhibits a complex self-organization of 5d electrons. In this phase transition, various factors, such as geometrical frustration of the pyrochlore structure, moderately strong electron correlation, Jahn-Teller-like distortion, phase transition to the insulating state, and formation of chemical bonds in solids, which are powerful driving forces for achieving a wide variety of electronic properties in transition metal oxides, play important roles. In CsW2O6, the interplay of these factors has led to the emergence of an electronic phase transition that preserves the cubic symmetry, three-dimensional nesting of Fermi surfaces, a possible charge order with a fractional valence satisfying the Anderson condition, and an equilateral-triangular trimer formation by a three-centered-two-electron bond. In addition to the introduction of these unique features of CsW2O6, each of them has been compared to those of other materials to provide an overview of the electronic properties of a wide variety of related materials, which can contribute to a complete understanding of the vast and infinite electronic phenomena in transition metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Dendrites Nucleation in Li Metal Battery by Machine Learning Accelerated Molecular Simulations under Realistic Electrochemical Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncontrollable dendrites growth during electrochemical cycles leads to low Coulombic efficiency and critical safety issues in Li metal batteries. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the dendrite formation mechanism is essential for further enhancing the performance of Li metal batteries. Machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide atomic-scale resolution for various key processes at an ab-initio level accuracy. However, traditional MD simulation tools hardly capture Li electrochemical depositions, due to lack of an electrochemical constant potential (ConstP) condition. In this work, we propose a ConstP approach that combines a machine learning force field with the charge equilibration method to reveal the dynamic process of Li dendrites nucleation at Li metal anode surfaces. Our results show that both dead Li cluster formation and inhomogeneous Li electro-depositions can induce Li dendrites nucleation. We further reveal that the local aggregation of Li atoms in amorphous inorganic components of solid electrolyte interphase is the key factor triggering the nucleation process. Overall, our simulations provide microscopic insights for Li dendrites formations in Li metal anodes. More importantly, we present an efficient and accurate simulation method for modeling realistic ConstP conditions, which holds considerable potential for broader applications in modeling of complex electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>Nano-Patterned Pt-Based Metallic Glass Electrocatalysts with In-Situ Copper Oxide Foam for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier for replacing fossil fuels, and hydrogen production via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an environmentally friendly option if electrocatalysts with low overpotentials and long-term stability are used. In this work, the electrocatalytic performance of $\mathrm{Pt_{57.5}Cu_{14.7}Ni_{5.3}P_{22.5}}$ bulk metallic glass (BMG) with flat, micro-patterned, and nano-patterned surfaces for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 is studied. The nano-patterned Pt-BMG demonstrates outstanding long-term stability and self-improving behavior with a final overpotential of 150 mV and a Tafel slope of 42 $\mathrm{mV dec^{-1}}$ after 1000 linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) cycles, which is respectively 42% and 37% lower than in the first LSV cycle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) indicate the formation of a layer of CuO/Cu2O foam deposited on top of the nano-patterned surface during the stability test of 1000 LSV cycles. A three-step process is proposed to explain the formation of CuxO foam via dynamic hydrogen bubble templating (DHBT) electrodeposition from Cu dissolution of the Pt-BMG without using copper salt. This work provides a method to create CuxO foams that could be used for various applications. Moreover, nano-patterned BMGs with DHBT deposition offer a feasible strategy to synthesize metal or metal-oxide foams.</description>

      <title>Automated detection and mapping of crystal tilt using thermal diffuse scattering in transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative interpretation of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data of crystalline specimens often requires the accurate knowledge of the local crystal orientation. A method is presented which exploits momentum-resolved scanning TEM (STEM) data to determine the local mistilt from a major zone axis. It is based on a geometric analysis of Kikuchi bands within a single diffraction pattern, yielding the centre of the Laue circle. Whereas the approach is not limited to convergent illumination, it is here developed using unit-cell averaged diffraction patterns corresponding to high-resolution STEM settings. In simulation studies, an accuracy of approximately 0.1mrad is found. The method is implemented in automated software and applied to crystallographic tilt and in-plane rotation mapping in two experimental cases. In particular, orientation maps of high-Mn steel and an epitaxially grown La$_{\text{0.7}}$Sr$_{\text{0.3}}$MnO$_{\text{3}}$-SrTiO$_{\text{3}}$ interface are presented. The results confirm the estimates of the simulation study and indicate that tilt mapping can be performed consistently over a wide field of view with diameters well above 100nm at unit cell real space sampling.</description>

      <title>Efficient parameterization of transferable Atomic Cluster Expansion for water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a highly accurate and transferable parameterization of water using the atomic cluster expansion (ACE). To efficiently sample liquid water, we propose a novel approach that involves sampling static calculations of various ice phases and utilizing the active learning (AL) feature of ACE-based D-optimality algorithm to select relevant liquid water configurations, bypassing computationally intensive ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Our results demonstrate that the ACE descriptors enable a potential initially-fitted solely on ice structures which is later upfitted with few configurations of liquid, identified with active learning to provide an excellent description of liquid water. The developed potential exhibits remarkable agreement with first-principles reference, accurately capturing various properties of liquid water, including structural characteristics such as pair correlation functions, covalent bonding profiles, and hydrogen bonding profiles, as well as dynamic properties like the vibrational density of states, diffusion coefficient and thermodynamic properties such as the melting point of the ice Ih. Our research introduces a new and efficient sampling technique for machine learning potentials in water simulations, while also presenting a transferable interatomic potential for water that reveals the accuracy of first principles reference. This advancement not only enhances our understanding the relationship between ice and liquid water at the atomic level, but also opens up new avenues for studying complex aqueous systems.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal Magnetic Deicing Using Two-Dimensional Chromium Telluride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) chromium telluride Cr2Te3 exhibits strong ferromagnetic ordering with high coercivity at low temperatures and paramagnetic behaviour when approaching room temperature. The spin states of monolayer Cr2Te3 show ferromagnetic ordering in the ground state, and in-situ Raman analysis shows reversible structure transformation and hence a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition during low-temperature heating cycles (0 - 25 {\deg}C). The magnetic phase transition near room temperature in the 2D Cr2Te3 prompted the exploration of these layered materials for energy application. We demonstrate that the low-temperature ferromagnetic behavior can be used to magnetically deice material surfaces using an external magnetic source, avoiding the use of harsh chemicals and high temperatures. The hydrophobic nature and dipole interactions of H2O molecules with the surface of the 2D Cr2Te3 coating aid in the condensation of ice droplets formed on the surface. First-principles calculations also confirm the observed crystal structure, surface interaction, and magnetic properties of 2D Cr2Te3.</description>

      <title>Thin Film Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Magnetic Properties of Novel Ternary Transition Metal Nitride MnCoN2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-throughput computational searches have predicted many novel ternary nitride compounds providing new opportunities for materials discovery in under explored phase spaces. Nevertheless, there are hardly any predictions and/or syntheses that incorporate only transition metals into new ternary nitrides. Here, we report on the synthesis, structure, and properties of MnCoN$_2$, a new ternary nitride material comprising only transition metals and N. We find that crystalline MnCoN$_2$ can be stabilized over its competing binaries, and over a tendency of this system to become amorphous, by controlling growth temperature within a narrow window slightly above ambient condition. We find that single-phase MnCoN$_2$ thin films form in a cation-disordered rocksalt crystal structure, which is supported by ab-initio calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that MnCoN$_2$ is sensitive to oxygen through various oxides and hydroxides binding to cobalt on the surface. X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used to verify that Mn$^{3+}$ and Co$^{3+}$ cations exist in an octahedrally-coordinated environment, which is distinct from a combination of CoN and MnN binaries and in agreement with the rocksalt-based crystal structure prediction. Magnetic measurements suggest that MnCoN$_2$ has a canted antiferromagnetic ground state below 10 K. We extract a Weiss temperature of $\theta$ = -49.7 K, highlighting the antiferromagnetic correlations in MnCoN$_2$.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We further confirm this scenario of the hidden energy scale by numerical simulations of spins on the kagome lattice. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Self-Hybridized Exciton-Polariton Photovoltaics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitonic semiconductors are attractive for next-generation photovoltaics (PVs) with lower cost, lighter weight, and lower material consumption than conventional technologies. Among them, transition metal dichalcogenide materials like WS2 are especially interesting due to exceptionally strong light-matter interaction. Photocurrent generation in excitonic PVs relies on exciton diffusion to heterointerfaces. However, efficiencies of excitonic PVs are often limited by short exciton diffusion lengths. Here we report that the strong coupling of excitons to cavity photons in a WS2 absorber layer can enhance the external quantum efficiency by a factor of &gt;10, internal quantum efficiency by a factor of ~3, and power conversion efficiency of excitonic PVs by an order of magnitude. The resulting hybrid states, exciton-polaritons, enhance the resonant absorption and exciton transport while the use of the WS2 layer as its own optical cavity enables broadband absorption. Thickness dependent device characterization reveals anomalous internal quantum efficiency and fill factor behavior that are attributed to novel exciton-polariton transport. Exciton-polariton enhanced transport occurs for both resonant and off-resonant excitation, emphasizing the value and practicality of the self-hybridized device structure. Our work presents a route towards excitonic PVs with broadband absorption and improved exciton transport without strict requirements of donor/acceptor structure of other excitonic PVs.</description>

      <title>Ultralow thermal conductance across the [FePt/h-BN/FePt] interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer in nanocomposite materials has attracted great interest for various applications. Multilayer structures provide an important platform to study interfacial thermal transport and to engineer materials with ultralow thermal conductivity. Here we report on the fabrication and thermal characterization of [h-BN/$L1_0$-FePt]xN multilayers, where hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets (2.5 nm thick) and $L1_0$-FePt layers (6.5 nm thick) alternate periodically. Differential three-omega($3\omega$) measurements reveal an ultralow effective thermal conductivity of $ 0.60 \pm 0.05 W \cdot m^{-1}K^{-1}$ across the multilayer films, and a low thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of $ 67.9 \pm 6.6 MW \cdot m^{-2}K^{-1}$ for the [FePt/h-BN(2.5nm)/FePt] interface at room temperature. We attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity to the weak van der Waals bonding at h-BN/FePt interfaces, which dominates the thermal resistance of the multilayer structure. These findings provide insights into the thermal transport in 2D-material/metal multilayer nanostructures and suggest the [h-BN/FePt] superlattice as a promising material for nanoscale thermal barrier coating. Furthermore, the obtained TBC lays the foundation for analyzing heat transfer in FePt-(h-BN) nanogranular films, a promising magnetic recording media which can potentially provide high thermal gradient for heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). This work advances the understanding of thermal transport in 2D-material/metal nanocomposites and demonstrates interface engineering as an effective approach to achieve materials with ultralow thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance hysteresis in the superconduting state of Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hysteresis of magnetoresistance observed in superconductors is of great interest due to its potential connection with unconventional superconductivity. In this study, we perform electrical transport measurements on Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ nanoflakes and uncover unusual hysteretic behaviour of magnetoresistance in the superconducting state. This hysteresis can be induced by applying either a large DC or AC current at temperatures ($T$) well below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). As $T$ approaches $T_{\rm c}$, similar weak hysteresis is also be detected by applying a small current. Various scenarios are discussed, with particular focus on the effects of vortex pinning and the presence of time-reversal-symmtery-breaking superconducting domains. Our findings support the latter, hinting at chiral superconductivity in Kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>A programmable wafer-scale chiroptical heterostructure of twisted aligned carbon nanotubes and phase change materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to design and dynamically control chiroptical responses in solid-state matter at wafer scale enables new opportunities in various areas. Here we present a full stack of computer-aided designs and experimental implementations of a dynamically programmable, unified, scalable chiroptical heterostructure containing twisted aligned one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and non-volatile phase change materials (PCMs). We develop a software infrastructure based on high-performance machine learning frameworks, including differentiable programming and derivative-free optimization, to efficiently optimize the tunability of both excitonic reciprocal and linear-anisotropy-induced nonreciprocal circular dichroism (CD) responses. We experimentally implement designed heterostructures with wafer-scale self-assembled aligned CNTs and deposited PCMs. We dynamically program reciprocal and nonreciprocal CD responses by inducing phase transitions of PCMs, and nonreciprocal responses display polarity reversal of CD upon sample flipping in broadband spectral ranges. All experimental results agree with simulations. Further, we demonstrate that the vertical dimension of heterostructure is scalable with the number of stacking layers and aligned CNTs play dual roles - the layer to produce CD responses and the Joule heating electrode to electrically program PCMs. This heterostructure platform is versatile and expandable to a library of 1D nanomaterials and electro-optic materials for exploring novel chiral phenomena and photonic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Cavity electromagnonic system, which simultaneously consists of cavities for photons, magnons (quanta of spin waves), and acoustic phonons, provides an exciting platform to achieve coherent energy transduction among different physical systems down to single quantum level. Here we report a dynamical phase-field model that allows simulating the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic waves, magnetization, and strain in 3D multiphase systems. As examples of application, we computationally demonstrate the excitation of hybrid magnon-photon modes (magnon polaritons), Floquet-induced magnonic Aulter-Townes splitting, dynamical energy exchange (Rabi oscillation) and relative phase control (Ramsey interference) between the two magnon polariton modes. The simulation results are consistent with analytical calculations based on Floquet Hamiltonian theory. Simulations are also performed to design a cavity electro-magno-mechanical system that enables the triple phonon-magnon-photon resonance, where the resonant excitation of a chiral, fundamental (n=1) transverse acoustic phonon mode by magnon polaritons is demonstrated. With the capability to predict coupling strength, dissipation rates, and temporal evolution of photon/magnon/phonon mode profiles using fundamental materials parameters as the inputs, the present dynamical phase-field model represents a valuable computational tool to guide the fabrication of the cavity electromagnonic system and the design of operating conditions for applications in quantum sensing, transduction, and communication.</description>

      <title>Acoustically Transparent Alumina-based Cranial Implants Enhance Ultrasound Transmission Through a Combined Mechano-Acoustic Resonant Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Therapeutic ultrasound for brain stimulation has increased in the last years. This energy has shown promising results for treating Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and traumatic brain injury, among other conditions. However, the application of ultrasound in the brain should trespass a natural but highly attenuating and distorting barrier, the cranium. Implantable ceramic materials can be used to replace part of the cranium as an alternate method to enhance ultrasound transmission. In this work, it is presented the acoustic characterization of alumina ceramic disks that can be employed as cranial implants for acoustic windows-to-the-brain. Alumina samples were prepared using current-activated pressure-assisted densification and were acoustically characterized. Acoustic impedance and attenuation of the samples were determined for different porosities. Additionally, measured and modeled acoustic fields are presented and analyzed in terms of the total ultrasound transmitted through the ceramics. Results indicate a resonant behavior in the alumina disks when the thickness corresponds to a half-wavelength of ultrasound; this resonance permits a total of 95.4% of ultrasound transmission; for thicknesses out of the resonant zone, transmission is 53.0%. Alumina proves to be an excellent medium for ultrasound transmission that, in conjunction with its mechanical and optical properties, can be useful for cranium replacement in mixed opto-acoustic applications.</description>

      <title>Fast Small-Angle X-ray Scattering Tensor Tomography: An Outlook into Future Applications in Life Sciences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small Angle-X-ray Scattering Tensor Tomography (SAS-TT) is a relatively new, but powerful technique for studying the multiscale architecture of hierarchical structures, which is of particular interest for life science applications. Currently, the technique is very demanding on synchrotron beamtime, which limits its applications, especially for cases requiring a statistically relevant amount of sample. This study reports the first SAS-TT measurement at a macromolecular X-ray crystallography beamline, PX-I at the SLS, with an improvement in data acquisition time from 96 h/Mvoxel in the pilot experiments to 6 h/Mvoxel, defining a new standard for fast SAS-TT and allowing the measurement of a full tomogram in 1.2 hours. Measurements were performed on the long and lenticular process of the incus bone, one of the three human auditory ossicles. The main orientation and degree of alignment of the mineralised collagen fibrils are characterised, as well as the size and shape of the mineral particles which show relevant variations in different tissue locations. The study reveals three distinct regions of high fibril alignment, most likely important pathways of sound throughout the ossicular chain, and highlights the potential of the technique to aid in future developments in middle ear reconstructive surgery.</description>

      <title>Molecule Graph Networks with Many-body Equivariant Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries, thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates equivariant many-body interactions to preserve directional information in the message passing scheme. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar and tensorial quantum chemical properties. Ablation studies show an average performance improvement of 7.9% across 11 out of 12 properties in QM9, 27.9% in forces in MD17, and 11.3% in polarizabilities (CCSD) in QM7b.</description>

      <title>Advances in perovskite nanocrystals and nanocomposites for scintillation applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the field of radiation detection has witnessed a paradigm shift with the emergence of plastic scintillators incorporating perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). This innovative class of scintillators not only capitalizes on the superior luminescent properties of PNCs but also harnesses the flexibility and processability of polymers. This review explores the intricate landscape of synthesizing and fabricating scintillating PNCs and nanocomposites, delving into the methods employed in their production. From solution-based methods to innovative solid-state approaches, the synthesis of PNCs for scintillators application is explored comprehensively. Furthermore, embedding strategies within polymeric matrices are scrutinized, shedding light on the various techniques utilized to achieve optimal dispersion and compatibility. The evaluation of the final nanocomposites is finally discussed, with a particular emphasis on their scintillating performance and radiation hardness. Through a meticulous exploration of synthesis methodologies, embedding techniques, and performance assessments, this review aims to provide a multilayered understanding of the state-of-the-art in PNCs-based nanoscintillators.</description>

      <title>Chiral {\pi} Domain Walls Composed of Twin Half-Integer Surface Disclinations in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals are polar fluids characterized by microscopic orientational ordering and macroscopic spontaneous polarizations. Within these fluids, walls that separate domains of different polarizations are ubiquitous. We demonstrate that the {\pi} walls in films of polar fluids consist of twin half-integer surface disclinations spaced horizontally, enclosing a subdomain where the polarization exhibits left- or right-handed {\pi} twists across the film. The degenerate geometric configurations of these twin disclinations give rise to kinks and antikinks, effectively partitioning subdomains of opposite chirality like Ising chains. The hierarchical topological structures dictate that field-driven polar switching entails a two-step annihilation process of the disclinations. These findings serve as a cornerstone for comprehending other walls in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials, thereby laying the base for domain engineering crucial for advancing their nonlinear and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Unifying Mixed Gas Adsorption in Molecular Sieve Membranes and MOFs using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent machine learning models to accurately obtain gas adsorption isotherms focus on polymers or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) separately. The difficulty in creating a unified model that can predict the adsorption trends in both types of adsorbents is challenging, owing to the diversity in their chemical structures. Moreover, models trained only on single gas adsorption data are incapable of predicting adsorption isotherms for binary gas mixtures. In this work, we address these problems using feature vectors comprising only the physical properties of the gas mixtures and adsorbents. Our model is trained on adsorption isotherms of both single and binary mixed gases inside carbon molecular sieving membrane (CMSM), together with data available from CoRE MOF database. The trained models are capable of accurately predicting the adsorption trends in both classes of materials, for both pure and binary components. ML architecture designed for one class of material, is not suitable for predicting the other class, even after proper training, signifying that the model must be trained jointly for proper predictions and transferability. The model is used to predict with good accuracy the CO2 uptake inside CALF-20 framework. This work opens up a new avenue for predicting complex adsorption processes for gas mixtures in a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Crystallization and Phase Transition of Niobium Dioxide Thin-Films for Neuromorphic Computing Applications Using a Tube Furnace Optical Transmission System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant research has focused on low-power stochastic devices built from memristive materials. These devices foster neuromorphic approaches to computational efficiency enhancement in merged biomimetic and CMOS architectures due to their ability to phase transition from a dielectric to a metal at an increased temperature. Niobium dioxide has a volatile memristive phase change that occurs $\sim$800$^\circ$C~that makes it an ideal candidate for future neuromorphic electronics. A straightforward optical system has been developed on a horizontal tube furnace for \emph{in situ} spectral measurements as an as-grown \NbtOf\ film is annealed and ultimately crystallizes as \NbOt. The system measures the changing spectral transmissivity of \NbtOf\ as it undergoes both reduction and crystallization processes. We were also able to measure the transition from metallic-to-non-metallic \NbOt\ during the cooldown phase, which is shown to occur about 100$^\circ$C~ lower on a sapphire substrate than fused silica. After annealing, the material properties of the \NbtOf\ and \NbOt\ were assessed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and 4-point resistivity, confirming that we have made crystalline \NbOt.</description>

      <title>Highly Sensitive Label-free Biomolecular Detection Using Au-WS2 Nanohybrid Based SERS Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in nanotechnology have led to the development of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based rapid and low-cost technologies for ultra-sensitive label-free detection and identification of molecular analytes. Herein, we utilized the synergistic plasmonic and chemical enhancement effects of Au-WS2 nanohybrids to attain the high-intensity Raman signals of targeted analytes. To develop these nanohybrids, a series of monodispersed Au nanoparticles (NPs) of varying diameters from 20 to 80 nm was chemically synthesized and successively blended with liquid-phase exfoliated WS2 nano-flakes of average lateral size 90 nm. They provided a maximum enhancement factor (EF) of ~1.80 109 corresponding to the characteristic peaks at 1364 cm-1 and 1512 cm-1 for R6G analyte molecules. Theoretical studies based on the finite-difference time-domain simulations on Au-WS2 nanohybrid systems revealed a huge field-intensity enhancement with an EF of more than 1000 at the plasmonic hotspots, which was induced by the strong coupling of individual plasmon oscillations of the adjacent Au NPs upon light interactions. These electromagnetic effects along with the chemical enhancement effects of WS2 nanoflakes were found to be mainly responsible for such huge enhancement in Raman signals. Furthermore, these hybrids were successfully employed for achieving highly sensitive detection of the E. coli ATCC 35218 bacterial strain with a concentration of 104 CFU/mL in phosphate-buffered saline media, indicating their real capabilities for practical scenarios. The findings of the present study will indeed provide vital information in the development of innovative nanomaterial-based biosensors, that will offer new possibilities for addressing critical public health concerns.</description>

      <title>Towards the optimization of a perovskite-based room temperature ozone sensor: A multifaceted approach in pursuit of sensitivity, stability, and understanding of mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted significant attention owing to their simple manufacturing process and unique optoelectronic properties. Their reversible electrical or optical properties changes in response to oxidizing or reducing environments make them prospective materials for gas detection technologies. Despite advancements in perovskite-based sensor research, the mechanisms behind perovskite-gas interactions, vital for sensor performance, are still unexclusive. This work presents the first evaluation of the sensing performance and long-term stability of MHPs, considering factors such as halide composition variation and Mn doping levels. The research reveals a clear correlation between halide composition and sensing behavior, with Br-rich sensors displaying a p-type response to O3 gas, while Cl-based counterparts exhibit an n-type sensing behavior. Notably, Mn-doping significantly enhances the O3 sensing performance by facilitating the gas adsorption process, as supported by both atomistic simulations and experimental evidence. Long-term evaluation of the sensors provides valuable insights into evolving sensing behaviors, highlighting the impact of dynamic instabilities over time. Overall, this research offers insights into optimal halide combination and Mn-doping levels, representing a significant step forward in engineering room temperature perovskite-based gas sensors that are not only low-cost and high-performing but also durable, marking a new era in sensor technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel states of matter arise in quantum materials due to strong interactions among electrons. A nematic phase breaks the point group symmetry of the crystal lattice and is known to emerge in correlated materials. Here we report the observation of an intra-unit-cell nematic order and signatures of Pomeranchuk instability in the Kagome metal ScV6Sn6. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we reveal a stripe-like nematic order breaking the crystal rotational symmetry within the Kagome lattice itself. Moreover, we identify a set of van Hove singularities adhering to the Kagome layer electrons, which appear along one direction of the Brillouin zone while being annihilated along other high-symmetry directions, revealing a rotational symmetry breaking. Via detailed spectroscopic maps, we further observe an elliptical deformation of Fermi surface, which provides direct evidence for an electronically mediated nematic order. Our work not only bridges the gap between electronic nematicity and Kagome physics, but also sheds light on the potential mechanism for realizing symmetry-broken phases in correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Elasticity and acoustic velocities of $\delta$-AlOOH at extreme conditions: a methodology assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrous phases play a fundamental role in the deep-water cycle on Earth. Understanding their stability and thermoelastic properties is essential for constraining their abundance using seismic tomography. However, determining their elastic properties at extreme conditions is notoriously challenging. The challenges stem from the complex behavior of hydrogen bonds under high pressures and temperatures (P,Ts). In this study, we evaluate how advanced molecular dynamics simulation techniques can address these challenges by investigating the adiabatic elasticity and acoustic velocities of $\delta$-AlOOH, a critical and prototypical high-pressure hydrous phase. We compared the performances of three methods to assess their viability and accuracy. The thermoelastic tensor was computed up to 140 GPa and temperatures up to 2,700 K using molecular dynamics with a DeePMD machine-learning interatomic potential based on the SCAN meta-GGA functional. The excellent agreement with ambient condition single-crystal ultrasound measurements and the correct description of velocity changes induced by H-bond disorder-symmetrization transition observed at 10 GPa in Brillouin scattering measurements underscores the accuracy and efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Fermi pockets on Hund's metal surface of Sr2RuO4 induced by the correlation-enhanced spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of the topmost layer in Sr2RuO4 in the close vicinity of the Fermi level is investigated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with a 7-eV laser. We find that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) predicted as 100 meV by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations is enormously enhanced in a real material up to 250 meV, even more than that of bulk state (200 meV), by the electron-correlation effect increased by the octahedral rotation in the crystal structure. This causes the formation of highly orbital-mixing small Fermi pockets and reasonably explains why the orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT) is not realized in perovskite oxides with crystal distortion. Interestingly, Hund's metal feature allows the quasiparticle generation only near EF, restricting the spectral gap opening derived by band hybridization within an extremely small binding energy (&lt; 10 meV). Furthermore, it causes coherent-incoherent crossover, making the Fermi pockets disappear at elevated temperatures. The anomalous Fermi pockets are characterized by the dichotomy of the orbital-isolating Hund's coupling and the orbital-mixing SOC, which is key to understanding the nature of Sr2RuO4.</description>

      <title>Topological Solitons in Square-root Graphene Nanoribbons Controlled by Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are unique quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials that have garnered a lot of research interest in the field of topological insulators. While the topological phases exhibited by GNRs are primarily governed by their chemical structures, the ability to externally control these phases is crucial for their potential utilization in quantum electronics and spintronics. Here we propose a class of GNRs featured by mirror symmetry and four zigzag segments in a unit cell that has unique topological properties induced and controlled by an externally applied electric field. Their band structures manifest two finite gaps which support topological solitons, as described by an effective square-root model. To demonstrate the experimental feasibility, we design and synthesize a representative partially zigzag chevron-type GNR (pzc-GNR) with the desired zigzag segments using a bottom-up approach. First-principles calculations on pzc-GNR reveal band inversions at the two finite gaps by switching the direction of the electric field, which is in accordance with predictions from the square-root Hamiltonian. We show different topological phases can be achieved by controlling the direction of the field and the chemical potential of the system in square-root GNRs. Consequently, upon adding a step-function electric field, solitons states can be generated at the domain wall. We discuss the properties of two types of soliton states, depending on whether the terminating commensurate unit cell is mirror symmetric.</description>

      <title>Excitons in nonlinear optical responses: shift current in MoS$_2$ and GeS monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that exciton effects are determinant to understand the optical absorption spectrum of low-dimensional materials. However, the role of excitons in nonlinear optical responses has been much less investigated at an experimental level. Additionally, computational methods to calculate nonlinear conductivities in real materials are still not widespread, particularly taking into account excitonic interactions. We present a methodology to calculate the excitonic second-order optical responses in 2D materials relying on: (i) ab initio tight-binding Hamiltonians obtained by Wannier interpolation and (ii) the Bethe-Salpeter equation with effective electron-hole interactions. Here, in particular, we explore the role of excitons in the shift current of monolayer materials. Focusing on MoS$_2$ and GeS monolayer systems, our results show that $2p$-like excitons, which are dark in the linear response regime, yield a contribution to the photocurrent comparable to that of $1s$-like excitons. Under radiation with intensity $\sim 10^{4} $W/cm$^2$, the excitonic theory predicts in-gap photogalvanic currents of almost $\sim 10$ nA in sufficiently clean samples, which is typically one order of magnitude higher than the value predicted by independent-particle theory near the band edge.</description>

      <title>Stress-Dependent Optical Extinction in LPCVD Silicon Nitride Measured by Nanomechanical Photothermal Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding optical absorption in silicon nitride is crucial for cutting-edge technologies like photonic integrated circuits, nanomechanical photothermal infrared sensing and spectroscopy, and cavity optomechanics. Yet, the origin of its strong dependence on film deposition and fabrication process is not fully understood. This Letter leverages nanomechanical photothermal sensing to investigate optical extinction $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ at 632.8 nm wavelength in LPCVD SiN strings across a wide range of deposition-related tensile stresses ($200-850$ MPa). Measurements reveal a reduction in $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ from 10$^3$ to 10$^1$ ppm with increasing stress, correlated to variations in Si/N content ratio. Within the band-fluctuations framework, this trend indicates an increase of the energy bandgap with the stress, ultimately reducing absorption. Overall, this study showcases the power and simplicity of nanomechanical photothermal sensing for low absorption measurements, offering a sensitive, scattering-free platform for material analysis in nanophotonics and nanomechanics.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport and thermoelectric studies of antiperovskite semimetal: Mn3SnC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the magnetotransport and thermoelectric (Seebeck and Nernst coefficients) properties of Mn3SnC an antiperovskite magnetic Nodal line semimetal. Mn3SnC shows paramagnetic (PM) to concurrent antiferromagnetic (AFM)/ferromagnetic (FM) transition at 286 K. The electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient indicate the importance of electron magnon scattering in the concurrent AFM/FM regime. We observed a large positive magnetoresistance (MR) of 8.2 at 8 T field near magnetic transition, in the otherwise negative MR behaviour for low temperatures. The electrical resistivity and MR show a weak thermal hysteresis around the boundary of transition temperature and the width of hysteresis decreases as magnetic field increases. Interestingly the Hall and Seebeck coefficients change sign from positive to negative below the transition temperature, highlighting the different scattering for holes and electrons in this multi-band system. The Seebeck and Nernst signal exhibit two sharp anomalies; one at the transition temperature and another at 50 K. The anomaly at magnetic transition in the Nernst signal disappear at 8 T magnetic field, owing to the reduction of magnetic fluctuation. A pseudo-gap near the Fermi level produces an upturn with a broad minimum in the Seebeck signal.</description>

      <title>Electrical switching of chirality in rhombohedral graphene Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Chern insulator hosts topologically protected chiral edge currents with quantized conductance characterized by its Chern number. Switching the chirality of the Chern insulator, namely, the direction of the edge current, is highly challenging due to topologically forbidden backscattering but is of considerable importance for the design of topological devices. Nevertheless, this can be achieved by reversing the sign of the Chern number through a topological phase transition. Here, we report electrically switchable chirality in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene-based Chern insulators. The surface flat band and giant Berry curvature in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a highly tunable platform for engineering the topological states. By introducing moire superlattices in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene, we observed a cascade of topological phase transitions at quarter electron filling of a moire band. The Chern number can be continuously tuned from 0, -1, 1 to 2 by electric fields, manifesting as a large anomalous Hall effect and following Streda's formula. Sign reversal and the anomalous Hall effect also occurred at non-integer fillings, suggesting the possibility of electrically tunable topological phase transitions within the regime of fractional Chern insulators. Our work establishes rhombohedral heptalayer graphene moire superlattices as a versatile platform for topological engineering. The realization of switchable chirality enhances the potential application of chiral edge currents in topological circuit interconnects.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy of $4f$ atoms on a WSe$_2$ monolayer: a DFT+U study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in the field of single-atom magnets, particularly those involving rare-earth (RE) elements, we present a theoretical exploration employing DFT+$U$ calculations to investigate the magnetic properties of selected $4f$ atoms, specifically Eu, Gd and Ho, on a monolayer of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ in the 1H-phase. This study comparatively examines RE with diverse $4f$ orbital fillings and valence chemistry, aiming to understand how different coverage densities atop WSe$_2$ affect the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. We observe that RE elements lacking $5d$ occupation in the atomic limit exhibit larger magnetic anisotropy energies at high densities, while those with outer $5d$ electrons show larger anisotropies in dilute configurations. Additionally, even half-filled $4f$ shell atoms with small orbital magnetic moments can generate substantial energy barriers for magnetization rotation due to prominent orbital hybridizations with WSe$_2$. Open $4f$ shell atoms further enhance anisotropy barriers through spin-orbit coupling effects. This aspect is crucial for the experimental realization of stable magnetic information units.</description>

      <title>Structural and Electrical Properties of Grafted Si/GaAsSb Heterojunction</title>

Abstract: The short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength, especially 1.55 um, has attracted significant attention in various areas such as high-speed optical communication and LiDAR systems. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are a critical component as a receiver in these systems due to their internal gain which enhances the system performance. Silicon-based APDs are promising since they are CMOS compatible, but they are limited in detecting 1.55 um light detection. This study proposes a p-type Si on n-type GaAs0.51Sb0.49 (GaAsSb) lattice matched to InP substrates heterojunction formed using a grafting technique for future GaAsSb/Si APD technology. A p+Si nanomembrane is transferred onto the GaAsSb/AlInAs/InP substrate, with an ultrathin ALD-Al2O3 oxide at the interface, which behaves as both double-side passivation and quantum tunneling layers. The devices exhibit excellent surface morphology and interface quality, confirmed by atomic force microscope (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Also, the current-voltage (I-V) of the p+Si/n-GaAsSb heterojunction shows ideal rectifying characteristics with an ideality factor of 1.15. The I-V tests across multiple devices confirm high consistency and yield. Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement reveals that GaAsSb and Si are found to have type-II band alignment with a conduction band offset of 50 meV which is favorable for the high-bandwidth APD application. The demonstration of the GaAsSb/Si heterojunction highlights the potential to advance current SWIR PD technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magneto-optical properties of two-dimensional nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals in the presence of antiferromagnetic order. Using the Kubo formula, we calculate the conductivity tensor of two-dimensional CuMnAs, a prototype antiferromagnetic Dirac material, as a function of light frequency. From the finite-frequency conductivity tensor, we derive the dynamic dielectric function and magnetic linear dichroism, demonstrating how they are influenced by the orientation of the N{\'e}el order parameter. Adjusting the N{\'e}el vector changes both the sign and amplitude of the system's magneto-optical response. We propose that magnetic linear dichroism spectroscopy is a powerful technique for determining the orientation of the N{\'e}el vector.</description>

      <title>Right On Time: Ultrafast Charge Separation Before Hybrid Exciton Formation</title>

Abstract: Organic/inorganic hybrid systems offer great potential for novel solar cell design combining the tunability of organic chromophore absorption properties with high charge carrier mobilities of inorganic semiconductors. However, often such material combinations do not show the expected performance: while ZnO, for example, basically exhibits all necessary properties for a successful application in light-harvesting, it was clearly outpaced by TiO$_2$ in terms of charge separation efficiency. The origin of this deficiency has long been debated. This study employs femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and many-body ab initio calculations to identify and quantify all elementary steps leading to the suppression of charge separation at an exemplary organic/ZnO interface. We demonstrate that charge separation indeed occurs efficiently on ultrafast (350 fs) timescales, but that electrons are recaptured at the interface on a 100 ps timescale and subsequently trapped in a strongly bound (0.7 eV) hybrid exciton state with a lifetime exceeding 5 $\mu$s. Thus, initially successful charge separation is followed by delayed electron capture at the interface, leading to apparently low charge separation efficiencies. This finding provides a sufficiently large timeframe for counter-measures in device design to successfully implement specifically ZnO and, moreover, invites material scientists to revisit charge separation in various kinds of previously discarded hybrid systems.</description>

Abstract: Chemical activation of the intrinsically inert basal planes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is crucial for developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts for energy technology applications. Here we report the discovery of an efficient TMD-based topological catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), containing high-density single-atom reactive centers on a few-layer (7x7)-PtTe2-x superstructure with a Te-vacancy density of x. Compared with pristine Pt(111), PtTe2, and (2x2)-PtTe2-x, (7x7)-PtTe2-x exhibits superior HER performance owing to its substantially increased density of undercoordinated Pt sites, and displays exceptional catalytic stability when operating at high current densities. Our first-principles calculations confirm that multiple types of undercoordinated Pt sites on (7x7)-PtTe2-x exhibit favorable hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energies, and that the reactive sites can further increase their population upon increasing hydrogen coverage. Both the (2x2)- and (7x7)-PtTe2-x are also shown to possess nontrivial band topology with robust edge states that may further facilitate HER.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a minimal Landau theory of plastic-to-crystal phase transitions in which the key components are a multipole-moment order parameter that describes the orientational ordering of the constituent molecules, coupling between such order parameter and elastic strains, and thermal expansion. We illustrate the theory with the simplest non-trivial model in which the orientational ordering is described by a quadrupole moment, and use such model to calculate barocaloric effects in plastic crystals that are driven by hydrostatic pressure. The model captures characteristic features of plastic-to-crystal phase transitions, namely, large changes in volume and entropy at the transition, as well as the linear dependence of the transition temperature with pressure. We identify temperature regions in the barocaloric response associated with the individual plastic and crystal phases, and those involving the phase transition. Our model is in overall agreement with previous experiments in powdered samples of fullerite C$_{60}$, and predicts peak isothermal entropy changes of $\sim90 \,{\rm J K^{-1} kg^{-1}}$ and peak adiabatic temperature changes of $\sim35 \,{\rm K}$ under $0.60\,$GPa at $265\,$K in fullerite single crystals.</description>

      <title>Accounting for localized deformation: a simple computation of true stress in micropillar compression experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compression experiments are widely used to study the mechanical properties of materials at micro- and nanoscale. However, the conventional engineering stress measurement method used in these experiments neglects to account for the alterations in the material's shape during loading. This can lead to inaccurate stress values and potentially misleading conclusions about the material's mechanical behavior especially in the case of localized deformation. To address this issue, we present a method for calculating true stress in cases of localized plastic deformation commonly encountered in experimental settings: (i) a single band and (ii) two bands oriented in arbitrary directions with respect to the vertical axis of the pillar (either in the same or opposite directions). Our simple analytic formulas can be applied to homogeneous and isotropic materials and crystals, requiring only standard data (displacement-force curve, aspect ratio, shear band angle and elastic strain limit) obtained from experimental results and eliminating the need for finite element computations. Our approach provides a more precise interpretation of experimental results and can serve as a valuable and simple tool in material design and characterization.</description>

      <title>Quantifying chemical short-range order in metallic alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic alloys often form phases - known as solid solutions - in which chemical elements are spread out on the same crystal lattice in an almost random manner. The tendency of certain chemical motifs to be more common than others is known as chemical short-range order (SRO) and it has received substantial consideration in alloys with multiple chemical elements present in large concentrations due to their extreme configurational complexity (e.g., high-entropy alloys). Short-range order renders solid solutions "slightly less random than completely random", which is a physically intuitive picture, but not easily quantifiable due to the sheer number of possible chemical motifs and their subtle spatial distribution on the lattice. Here we present a multiscale method to predict and quantify the SRO state of an alloy with atomic resolution, incorporating machine learning techniques to bridge the gap between electronic-structure calculations and the characteristic length scale of SRO. The result is an approach capable of predicting SRO length scale in agreement with experimental measurements while comprehensively correlating SRO with fundamental quantities such as local lattice distortions. This work advances the quantitative understanding of solid-solution phases, paving the way for SRO rigorous incorporation into predictive mechanical and thermodynamic models.</description>

      <title>Assessing exchange-correlation functionals for heterogeneous catalysis of nitrogen species</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing interest in sustainable synthesis of ammonia, nitrates, and urea has led to an increase in studies of catalytic conversion between nitrogen-containing compounds using heterogeneous catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) is commonly employed to obtain molecular-scale insight into these reactions, but there have been relatively few assessments of the exchange-correlation functionals that are best suited for heterogeneous catalysis of nitrogen compounds. Here, we assess a range of functionals ranging from the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the random phase approximation (RPA) for the formation energies of gas-phase nitrogen species, the lattice constants of representative solids from several common classes of catalysts (metals, oxides, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)), and the adsorption energies of a range of nitrogen-containing intermediates on these materials. The results reveal that the choice of exchange-correlation functional and van der Waals correction can have a surprisingly large effect and that increasing the level of theory does not always improve the accuracy for nitrogen-containing compounds. This suggests that the selection of functionals should be carefully evaluated on the basis of the specific reaction and material being studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry), a symmetry for the combined operations of space inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) and time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$), is a fundamental concept of physics and characterizes the functionality of materials as well as $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries. In particular, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems can be found in the centrosymmetric crystals undergoing the parity-violating magnetic order which we call the odd-parity magnetic multipole order. While this spontaneous order leaves $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry intact, the simultaneous violation of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries gives rise to various emergent responses that are qualitatively different from those allowed by the nonmagnetic $\mathcal{P}$-symmetry breaking or by the ferromagnetic order. In this review, we introduce candidates hosting the intriguing spontaneous order and overview the characteristic physical responses. Various off-diagonal and/or nonreciprocal responses are identified, which are closely related to the unusual electronic structures such as hidden spin-momentum locking and asymmetric band dispersion.</description>

Abstract: Recently colossal Seebeck coefficient ($S$) has found in the several thermoelectric (TE) materials. We present colossal $S$ and large thermal electron motivate force (EMF) reproduced by space charge (SC) model, introducing multi-Debye lengths within grain boundaries (GBs) of TE materials with phonon drag (PD) effect accompanying with electron by electron-phonon interaction. In addition to $S$, the polarity reversal was also reproduced by transfer process with inner bias around SP generated from thermal EMF. Colossal $S$ and EMF for TE material were reproduced by inner SC model as a functions of averaged multi-Debye length within GBs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy of L1$_0$ FeNi (001), (010), and (111) ultrathin films: A first-principles study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous experiments, thin films of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi with different surfaces, including (001), (110) and (111), were produced and studied. Each surface defines a different alignment of the crystallographic tetragonal axis with respect to the film's plane, resulting in different magnetic anisotropies. In this study, we use density functional theory calculations to examine three series of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with surfaces (001), (010), and (111), and with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 3 nm (from 4 to 16 atomic monolayers). Our results show that films (001) have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, while (010) favor in-plane magnetization, with a clear preference for the tetragonal axis [001]. We propose calling this type of in-plane anisotropy fixed in plane. A film with surface (111) and a thickness of four atomic monolayers has the magnetization easy axis almost perpendicular to the plane of the film. As the thickness of the (111) film increases, the direction of magnetization rotates towards a tetragonal axis [001], positioned at an angle of about 45$^{o}$ to the plane of the film. Furthermore, the magnetic moment of ultrathin films increases by a maximum of 5%, and the most significant changes in spin and orbital magnetic moments occur at a depth of about three near-surface atomic monolayers. The presented results could be useful for experimental efforts to synthesize ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with different surfaces. Ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with varying magnetic anisotropies may find applications in spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Black phosphorus nitrogen (BP-N) is an attractive high-energy-density material. However, high-pressure synthesized BP-N will decompose at low-pressure and cannot be quenched to ambient conditions. Finding a method to stabilize it at 0 GPa is of great significance for its practical applications. However, unlike cg-N, LP-N, and HLP-N, it is always a metastable phase at high-pressure up to 260 GPa, and decomposes into chains at 23 GPa. Here, based on the first-principles simulations, we find that P atom doping can effectively reduce the synthesis pressure of BP-N and maintain its stability at 0 GPa. Uniform distribution of P atom dopants within the layer helps maintain the structural stability of BP-N layer at 0 GPa, while interlayer electrostatic interaction induced by N-P dipoles enhances its dynamic stability by eliminating interlayer slipping. Furthermore, pressure is conducive to enhancing the stability of BP-N and its doped forms by suppressing N-chain dissociation. For the configuration with 12.5% doping concentration, a gravimetric energy density of 8.07 kJ/g can be realized, which is nearly two times higher than TNT.</description>

      <title>High-pressure characterization of Ag$_3$AuTe$_2$: Implications for strain-induced band tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent band structure calculations have suggested the potential for band tuning in a chiral semiconductor, Ag$_3$AuTe$_2$, to zero upon application of negative strain. In this study, we report on the synthesis of polycrystalline Ag$_3$AuTe$_2$ and investigate its transport, optical properties, and pressure compatibility. Transport measurements reveal the semiconducting behavior of Ag$_3$AuTe$_2$ with high resistivity and an activation energy $E_a$ of 0.2 eV. The optical band gap determined by diffuse reflectance measurements is about three times wider than the experimental $E_a$. Despite the difference, both experimental gaps fall within the range of predicted band gaps by our first-principles DFT calculations employing the PBE and mBJ methods. Furthermore, our DFT simulations predict a progressive narrowing of the band gap under compressive strain, with a full closure expected at a strain of -4% relative to the lattice parameter. To evaluate the feasibility of gap tunability at such substantial strain, the high-pressure behavior of Ag$_3$AuTe$_2$ was investigated by $in$ $situ$ high-pressure X-ray diffraction up to 47 GPa. Mechanical compression beyond 4% resulted in a pressure-induced structural transformation, indicating the possibilities of substantial gap modulation under extreme compression conditions.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of crystal-field, Zeeman splitting, and spin-phonon excitations in the quantum supersolid Na2BaCo(PO4)2</title>

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the recent breakthroughs in the \ce{Na_{2}BaCo(PO_{4})_{2}} quantum magnet, renowned for its spin supersolidity phase and its potential for revolutionary cooling applications, our study delves into the intricate interplay among lattice, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom within this intriguing compound. Using meticulous temperature, field, and pressure-dependent Raman scattering techniques, we present compelling experimental evidence revealing pronounced crystal-electric field (CEF) excitations, alongside the interplay of CEF-phonon interactions. Notably, our experiments elucidate all electronic transitions from $j_{1 / 2}$ to $j_{3 / 2}$ and from $j_{1 / 2}$ to $j_{5 / 2}$, with energy level patterns closely aligned with theoretical predictions based on point-charge models. Furthermore, the application of a magnetic field and pressure reveals Zeeman splittings characterized by Land\'e-g factors as well as the CEF-phonon resonances. The anomalous shift in coupled peak at low temperatures originates from the hybridization of CEF and phonon excitations due to their close energy proximity. These findings constitute a significant step towards unraveling the fundamental properties of this exotic quantum material for future research in fundamental physics or engineering application.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic second-order topological insulators in two-dimensional polymorphic graphyne with sublattice approximation</title>

Abstract: In two dimensions, intrinsic second-order topological insulators (SOTIs) are characterized by topological corner states that emerge at the intersections of distinct edges with reversed mass signs, enforced by spatial symmetries. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation within the class BDI to clarify the symmetry conditions ensuring the presence of intrinsic SOTIs in two dimensions. We reveal that the (anti-)commutation relationship between spatial symmetries and chiral symmetry is a reliable indicator of intrinsic corner states. Through first-principles calculations, we identify several ideal candidates within carbon-based polymorphic graphyne structures for realizing intrinsic SOTIs under sublattice approximation. Furthermore, we show that the corner states in these materials persist even in the absence of sublattice approximation. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of higher-order topological phases but also open new pathways for realizing topological corner states that are readily observable.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations arising from anti-Stoner spin excitations: an ab initio study of itinerant ferro- and antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anti-Stoner excitations are a spin-flips in which, effectively, an electron is promoted from a minority to a majority spin state, i.e., complementary to Stoner excitations and spin-waves. Since their spectral power is negligible in strong itinerant ferromagnets and they are identically absent in the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, their properties and role in correlating electrons were hardly investigated so far. On the other hand, they are present in weak ferromagnets, fcc Ni being a prominent example, and both types of spin-flips (down-to-up and up-to-down) must be treated on the equal footing in systems with the degenerate spin up and down bands, in particular antiferromagnets in which case we choose CrSb as a model system. For these two materials we evaluate the strength of the effective interaction between the quasiparticles and the gas of virtual spin-flip excitations. To this end, we compute the corresponding self-energy taking advantage of our novel efficient \textit{ab initio} numerical scheme. We find that in Ni the band-structure renormalization due to the anti-Stoner processes is weaker than the one due to Stoner-type magnons in the majority spin channel but the two become comparable in the minority one. The effect can be traced back primarily to the spectral strength of the respective spin excitations and the densities of the final available quasiparticle states in the scattering process. For the antiferromagnet, the situation is more complex and we observe that the electron-magnon interaction is sensitive not only to these densities of states but critically to the spatial shapes of the coupling magnonic modes as well.</description>

      <title>Inverse-current quantum electro-oscillations in a charge-density wave insulator</title>

Abstract: Quantum magneto-oscillations have long been a vital subject in condensed matter physics, with ubiquitous quantum phenomena and diverse underlying physical mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate the intrinsic and reproducible DC-current-driven quantum electro-oscillations with a periodicity in the inverse of the current (1/I), in quasi-one-dimensional charge-density-wave (CDW) insulators (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I and TaS$_3$ nanowires. Such oscillations manifest in the nearly infinite Fr\"ohlich conductivity region where the undamped CDW flow forms in a finite electric current, and finally disappear after the oscillation index n reaches 1. A systematic investigation on the effect of temperature and magnetic field establishes that the observed electro-oscillations are a coherent quantum phenomenon. We discuss the possibilities of the physical mechanisms, including the formation of sliding-driven inherent Floquet sidebands. Our results introduce a new member in the family of quantum oscillations, and shed light on plausible avenues to explore novel physics and potential applications of coherent density-wave condensates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Supersolid as a precursory Dirac Spin Liquid in a Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the recent experiments on the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, we propose the easy-axis XXZ spin-1/2 model on the triangular lattice, that exhibits a quantum spin supersolid, to be a precursory Dirac spin liquid. Despite the presence of a three-sublattice magnetic order as a spin supersolid, we suggest that this system is close to a Dirac spin liquid by exploring its spectroscopic response. The physical consequence is examined from the spectroscopic response, and we establish the continuous spectra near the M point in addition to the K point excitation from the spinon continuum on top of the three-sublattice order. Moreover, the satellite peaks were predicted at the mid-points connecting the $\Gamma$ and K points. This proposal offers a plausible understanding of the recent inelastic neutron scattering measurement in Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ and could inspire further research in relevant models and materials, such as K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ and Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, and even more anisotropic magnets like PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Interpreting Energy Barriers of Metallic Glasses with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used materials that are stronger than steel while being shapeable as plastic. While understanding the structure-property relationship of MGs remains a challenge in materials science, studying their energy barriers (EBs) as an intermediary step shows promise. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model MGs and study EBs. We contribute a new dataset for EB prediction and a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model that is E(3)-invariant in expectation. SymGNN handles invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure. When applied to EB prediction, SymGNN are more accurate than molecular dynamics (MD) local-sampling methods and other machine-learning models. Compared to precise MD simulations, SymGNN reduces the inference time on new MGs from roughly 41 days to less than one second. We apply explanation algorithms to reveal the relationship between structures and EBs. The structures that we identify through explanations match the medium-range order (MRO) hypothesis and possess unique topological properties. Our work enables effective prediction and interpretation of MG EBs, bolstering material science research.</description>

      <title>Amplified linear and nonlinear chiral sensing assisted by anapole modes in hybrid metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction between chiral molecules and circularly polarized light is largely influenced by the local optical chirality density. This interaction prompts substantial demand of the design of nanophotonic platforms capable of enhancing such effects across large and accessible volumes. Such a magnification requires nanostructures that provide strong electric and magnetic field enhancements while preserving the phase relation of circular light. Dielectric nanostructures, particularly those able to support resonances, are ideal candidates for this task due to their capacity for high electric and magnetic field enhancements. On the other hand, efficient third harmonic generation calls for strong electric field resonances within dielectric materials, a feature often boosted by incorporating plasmonic materials into hybrid systems. In this work, we numerically propose a coupled silicon disk-gold ring system that can exploit the anapole-induced field confinement to provide a broadband magnified circular dichroism under realistic conditions, reaching values up to a 230-fold enhancement. We also demonstrate that this structure can be employed as an efficient third harmonic generator which, when integrated with chiral media, enables an 800-fold enhancement in circular dichroism. Furthermore, we show that pulsed illumination at intensities up to 10 GW/cm2 does not induce temperature increments that could potentially damage the samples. These findings suggest that this system can be a promising and versatile approach towards ultrasensitive chiral sensing.</description>

      <title>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from first principles quantum electrodynamics</title>

Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed ab initio quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong light-matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be, in principles, enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. However, in a realistic cavity, we expect the T$_{\rm{c}}$ of MgB$_2$ can increase, at most, by $5$ K via photon vacuum fluctuations. The results highlight that strong light-matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

Abstract: Version 13 of XtalOpt, an evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from the CPC program library or the XtalOpt website, https://xtalopt.github.io. In the new version of the XtalOpt code, a general platform for multi-objective global optimization is implemented. This functionality is designed to facilitate the search for (meta)stable phases of functional materials through minimization of the enthalpy of a crystalline system coupled with the simultaneous optimization of any desired properties that are specified by the user. The code is also able to perform a constrained search by filtering the parent pool of structures based on a user-specified feature, while optimizing multiple objectives. Here, we present the implementation and various technical details, and we provide a brief overview of additional improvements that have been introduced in the new version of XtalOpt.</description>
