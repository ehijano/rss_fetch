      <title>Visible to Longwave-infrared imaging via an inverse-designed monolithic lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatic aberrations impose a fundamental barrier on optical design, confining most imaging systems to narrow spectral bands with fractional bandwidths typically limited to $\Delta\lambda/\lambda &lt; 1$. Here we report a monolithic, inverse-designed potassium bromide (KBr) lens that achieves broadband, near-achromatic focusing from 0.45 to 14 $\mu$m, a continuous spectral span covering the visible, near-, mid-, and long-wave infrared. This corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 1.9, approaching the theoretical limit of 2, while maintaining a nearly constant focal length across the entire range. The 19-mm-diameter, 22.5-mm-focal-length optic enables a single compact platform for hyperspectral imaging, mid-IR microscopy, super-resolution, imaging through scattering media, and simultaneous multi-band and long-range imaging. Coupling the KBr lens with a conventional refractive element further yields a hybrid telescope that extends these capabilities. By uniting inverse design with scalable manufacturing, this approach provides a route toward broadly deployable ultra-broadband imagers for biomedicine, climate and environmental monitoring, and space-based sensing.</description>

      <title>Mamyshev oscillator based on gain-managed nonlinearity and chirped pulse amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a Mamyshev oscillator based on gain-managed nonlinearity and chirped pulse amplification. To the best of our knowledge, this configuration is first presented. Different from other Mamyshev oscillators, the gain-managed nonlinear regime serves as a seed provider instead of a power amplifier in one arm. The output pulse energy over 300nJ has been achieved from the chirped pulsed amplification in another arm. This configuration provided a new approach to design a high-energy ultrafast laser.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent refractive index of AlGaAs for quantum-photonic devices near the bandgap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental method to determine the refractive index of $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ (x = 0.0 - 0.5) from 300 K to 4 K across the 500 - 1100 nm wavelength range. The values are extracted from spectroscopically observed microcavity resonances in thin $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ membranes embedded between fully and partially reflective gold mirrors. Refined Varshni and Paessler models are used to describe temperature-dependent bandgap shifts and material composition. By tracking resonance shifts and benchmarking against finite-difference time-domain simulations, we derive the dispersive optical response with high precision. This yields a quantitatively improved analytical expression for the refractive index of $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ matching the experimental results with a coefficient of determination as high as $R^2=0.993$, enabling accurate modeling near the band edge at cryogenic temperatures. The method is straightforward and broadly applicable to other semiconductor systems, offering a valuable tool for the design of micro photonic devices such as quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier transform of the hyperbola and its role in hyperbolic photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent breakthrough studies of wave hyperbolicity in extremely anisotropic natural materials and artificial composites, we investigate the radiation pattern of a localized emitter in a hyperbolic medium. Since the emission of a point source is associated with the Fourier transform of the iso-frequency contours of a medium, we derive and analyze the properties of the Fourier transform of hyperbolic dispersion, which sheds light into the emission properties in the presence of hyperbolic bands. Our analysis leads to a generalized form of Huygens' principle for hyperbolic waves, connecting to the emergence of negative refraction and focusing with hyperbolic media. We also highlight the occurrence of aliasing artifacts in polariton imaging. More broadly, our findings provide analytical tools to model polariton propagation in materials with extreme anisotropy, and may be applied to several other physical platforms featuring hyperbolic responses, from astrophysics to seismology.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarization matrix and its physical interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although electric and magnetic fields are intrinsically coupled in random stationary light, a complete and physically consistent second-order description of polarization requires a joint electromagnetic treatment. The 6x6 electromagnetic polarization matrix introduced here generalizes the conventional electric 3x3 matrix by incorporating both electric and magnetic contributions together with their mutual correlations. It consists of diagonal 3x3 blocks, representing the electric and magnetic polarization matrices, and off-diagonal 3x3 blocks that encode the full structure of electric-magnetic cross-correlations. The information contained in this matrix can be interpreted through physically meaningful quantities such as active and reactive energy fluxes, in-phase and quadrature alignment matrices, and global indices describing electric-magnetic coupling. The formalism is applied to a field composed of two orthogonally propagating plane waves sharing a common linear electric polarization (a simple yet physically realizable configuration) that demonstrates the need for a general combined electric-magnetic representation even in free space. This approach provides a comprehensive and unified framework for characterizing electromagnetic polarization beyond the electric-field description alone, bridging classical statistical optics with quantum-like density-matrix interpretations.</description>

      <title>GaN mid-IR plasmonics: low-loss epsilon-near-zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, defined by $ | Re({\epsilon}) | &lt; 1$, enable unique light propagation characteristics, including confinement within sub-wavelength regions. To reduce losses in this regime, materials with both near-zero permittivity and $n&lt;1$ refractive index, known as near-zero-index (NZI) materials, are desired. When both conditions are satisfied, the resulting region is classified as a low-loss ENZ medium combining strong light confinement with reduced optical losses. To achieve this behavior in the mid-IR, heavily doped semiconductors are required, and those compatible with current technologies are most desirable. This work provides the first in-depth study, supported by experimental demonstrations, of the plasmonic properties of highly doped GaN thin films on Si, exhibiting low optical losses and low-loss ENZ characteristics up to $3{\mu}m$. From the extracted optical parameters, the ENZ and NZI regions are determined and compared with the existing literature. As a result of the large polar character of nitrides, a hybridization of the surface plasmon and phonon polaritons is observed, accompanied by a flat-dispersion of the high-energy mode (pinned near the plasma frequency) indicative of its ENZ character. Establishing GaN as a viable platform for mid-IR ENZ-based plasmonics paves the way for integration into future infrared photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Multimode interface between optical free-space- and waveguide modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-space and on-chip photonic systems are key components in optical communication networks. While free-space beams allow for the flexible generation and manipulation of spatial modes, integrated waveguides provide compact and stable platforms for on-chip signal processing. Bridging these two domains is essential for scalable multi-mode communication networks. Here, we present an efficient, broadband interface capable of converting multiple higher-order free-space Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes into corresponding waveguide modes using the multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) scheme. We experimentally demonstrate low-crosstalk mode conversion between various set of three LG modes, and the first three TE modes of a multimode silicon waveguide across the telecom C-band. The system operates passively without active switching and can be adapted to different spatial mode sets. This platform provides a pathway to increased data capacities and may enable more compact and efficient multi-mode optical communication and on-chip processing schemes.</description>

      <title>Fully Integrated Perovskite Polaritonic Circuits with Tunable Lasing and Nonlinear Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are emerging as a key technology for compact and energy-efficient optical information processing. Yet, their practical implementation remains limited by the intrinsically weak optical nonlinearities of conventional materials, which demand high power and large footprints to achieve significant nonlinear responses. Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter excitations of semiconducting materials, offer a promising solution by combining strong optical nonlinearities with the high speed and large scalability typical of photonic devices. However, despite their potential, working on-chip polaritonic elements demonstrating room temperature coherent lasing, controllable nonlinear propagation, or amplification have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate a fully integrated perovskite polaritonic circuit that overcomes these limitations. Using a single-step microfluidic lithographic technique, we realize waveguide circuits with integrated gratings that simultaneously act as couplers and mirrors, forming in-plane Fabry-P\'erot cavities. These structures support robust in-plane polariton lasing between gratings, yielding coherent emission along the waveguide. Furthermore, we observe clear signatures of strong nonlinear self-phase modulation and, for the first time, optical amplification of guided polaritons at room temperature. Our simple, scalable platform opens the way to low-power, highly nonlinear optical circuits for integrated photonics and neuromorphic architectures operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Double-Helix based Real-Time Single Particle Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Real-Time, Feedback-Driven Single Particle Tracking methods, measurements of the emission intensity from a labeled, nanometer-scale particle are used in a feedback loop to track the motion of the particle as it moves inside its native environment, including within living cells. In this work, we take advantage of Point Spread Function (PSF) engineering techniques that encode the axial position of the particle into the shape of the PSF in the focal plane to eliminate the need for out-of-focal-plane measurements, reducing the complexity of implementation and decreasing the overall measurement time of the control loop. Specifically, we used the Double Helix PSF (DH-PSF) in which a single fluorescent source gives rise to two lobes in the image plane with the lobes rotating in the plane as the particle moves along the optical axis. We designed simple estimators of the relative error between the particle and the tracker, and a simple proportional feedback controller to regulate that error to zero. We explored the efficacy of the approach through simulation studies, demonstrating the tracking of fast-moving particles (with diffusion coefficients up to 10 {\mu\text{m}^2/\text{s}}) over long time periods (multiple seconds).</description>

      <title>Engineered mode coupling in high-Q microresonators enables deterministic low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton optical frequency combs have become key enablers for a wide range of applications, including telecommunications, optical atomic clocks, ultrafast distance measurements, dual-comb spectroscopy, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration, many of which benefit from low repetition rates. However, achieving such low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs is nontrivial as long cavities require substantially higher pump power, which induces stronger thermal effects that, in turn, exacerbate thermal instability and complicate access to stable soliton states. The dual-mode pumping scheme, in which a continuous-wave pump couples to both the comb-generating mode and an auxiliary mode, has proven simple and effective for mitigating thermal instability and enabling thermally accessible soliton generation. Yet, in long-cavity devices, the standard bus-to-resonator coupling conditions for these two modes diverge substantially, resulting in insufficient pump coupling to the auxiliary mode, which makes dual-mode pumping particularly challenging for low-repetition-rate microcombs. In this work, we overcome this limitation by coupling the pump to the auxiliary mode via inter-modal coupling, which can be introduced in racetrack microresonators and engineered by tailoring the cavity bend design. We validate this approach in a high-Q (&gt;$10^7$) silicon nitride microresonator and demonstrate thermally accessible, deterministic single-soliton generation at a repetition rate of 33 GHz. This work provides a simple and robust pathway for generating low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs.</description>

      <title>Design and optimization of zone plates for flying focus applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flying focus laser pulse technology, characterized by programmable velocity profiles and the ability to break the traditional link between focal spot motion and group velocity constraints, holds significant potential for revolutionary advances in high-intensity laser related fields. However,the flying focus generated with conventional approaches suffers from a low maximum intensity, as the energy is spread over a long distance, and the size of the focusing optics is also limited. Here, we propose a zone-plate-based flying focus scheme in which the zone widths are modulated by a sinusoidal random distribution. Numerical simulations show that the high-order foci produced by the modulated zone plate can be suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the scheme sustains a high-intensity focal region extending over more than 100 Rayleigh lengths. Furthermore, the focal speed can be tuned over a wide range, including values exceeding the speed of light in vacuum. Owing to these advantages, the proposed modulated zone-plate scheme offers new possibilities for high-intensity laser physics and holds promise for applications such as laser wakefield acceleration, photon acceleration, and more.</description>

      <title>Communication-ready high-power soliton microcombs in highly-dispersive Fabry-Perot-microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microcombs generated in optical microresonators are widely regarded as promising light sources for next-generation communication systems, but the optical power available per comb line has so far fallen short of practical requirements. Here we introduce an integrated Fabry-P\'erot microresonator platform that overcomes fundamental dispersion-engineering constraints and enables bright soliton microcombs with unprecedented power per line. The resonator is defined by chirped Bragg gratings that provide exceptionally large anomalous group-velocity dispersion, allowing more than ten comb lines to reach the milliwatt level. These combs can be used directly in coherent communication systems without additional amplification, achieving an aggregate data rate of 2 Tb/s. Once integrated, our high-power soliton microcombs could be instantly ready for communications as well as a broad range of practical comb-based applications.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Emission from Spintronic Stack Nanodecorated with Drop-Cast Core-Shell Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic emitters promise to revolutionise terahertz (THz) sources by converting ultrafast optical pulses into broadband THz radiation without phase-matching constraints. Because the conversion relies on spin-current injection across a nanometre-thin magnetic layer, its efficiency is ordinarily limited by weak optical coupling. Here, we present a demonstration of a drop-casting based approach to introduce ultrafast plasmonic-mediated coupling: a sparse-layer of silica-gold core-shell nanoparticles is deposited directly onto a W/Fe/Pt spintronic trilayer. This sparse (six percent) decoration increases the wafer-averaged THz pulse energy, pointing to a very high local conversion enhancement for this low-coverage spintronic emitter compared with the bare stack. This demonstration points to a viable pathway toward highly efficient spintronic terahertz emitters with potential applications in spectroscopy, imaging, and ultrafast technologies.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Multi-Wavelength Underwater Optical Channels in the Presence of Optical Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the performance of a Gaussian optical beam as it propagates through the turbulent underwater optical channel (UWOC) under the weak turbulence regime, where optical signal experiences significant fading and scattering, all of which can severely degrade communication quality. It is assumed that on-off keying (OOK) modulation with direct detection is utilized to establish a duplex communication link. A multi-wavelength beam approach is implemented to enhance the performance by leveraging the distinct propagation characteristics of different wavelengths. Performance is established in terms of the probability of fade, number of fade per second, mean fade duration, and mean time between fades. The use of multi-wavelength beam is shown to enhance performance by a sizable margin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian photonics offer singular sensitivity enhancements but have thus far been realized almost exclusively in spatially engineered platforms with fixed geometries and limited tunability. Here we extend EP physics into the temporal domain by introducing balanced gain--loss modulation in a photonic time crystal (PTC). A time-periodic refractive-index modulation $n(t)=n_{0}+\delta n\cos(\Omega t)$ generates an effective non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian that supports coalescence of quasi-eigenmodes in frequency space, constituting a genuine \textit{temporal exceptional point}. Using a reduced two-mode model for the dominant frequency sidebands, we derive a non-Hermitian dimer Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{PT}}(\Delta,\gamma,\kappa)$ that is strictly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric for $\Delta=0$ and identify the exact EP condition. Numerical analysis reveals the associated Riemann-sheet topology, mode exchange and Berry-phase accumulation upon encirclement of the EP, and the characteristic $\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ perturbation response indicative of enhanced sensing. We further construct a non-Hermitian transmission model that is exact within the reduced two-mode description, compute the Cram\'er--Rao bound (CRB) for temperature estimation under an explicit noise model, and show that EP-enhanced sensitivity persists when compared to a linewidth-matched Hermitian reference under identical resource constraints. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the CRB is saturable using spectral measurements. These results establish temporal non-Hermiticity as a new paradigm for dynamically reconfigurable, broadband, and geometry-independent exceptional-point photonics.</description>

      <title>Reflective Metalenses for Near-Infrared Wavelengths Based on Silicon Nanorods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and analysis of reflective metalenses optimized for a 900 nm wavelength, using silicon nanorods as the primary components. The metalens consists of unit cells, each containing a thin silicon rod. Lumerical FDTD software is used to create a detailed library that connects the dimensions of these nanorods with their respective phase shifts and reflectance properties. The nanorods are placed on a 70 nm thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer, with a 50 nm thick gold (Au) reflective layer underneath. In contrast to conventional transmissive metalenses, our design accomplishes complete 2{\pi} phase control via geometry-optimized silicon nanorods, facilitating compact reflective optics. By carefully examining the impact of nanorod dimensions on optical performance, the main goal is to optimize the metalens design for enhanced light focusing and manipulation, which could benefit imaging systems, optical communications, and sensor technology.</description>

      <title>Universal nondiffractive topological spin textures in vortex cores of light and sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report universal skyrmionic spin textures in the cores of optical and acoustic vortex beams, described within the framework of Laguerre-Gaussian modes. We analytically demonstrate nondiffractive propagating spin merons, independent of whether the field is transverse or longitudinal, with their sign controlled by the wavefront helicity. Experimental confirmation is provided in acoustics through full three-dimensional measurements of the velocity vector field. Although these phenomena are intrinsic to vortex cores, we also show that the claimed universality breaks down for higher-order topological charges, depending on the carrier mode, here exemplified using the Bessel framework.</description>

      <title>Tunable polarization-entangled near-infrared photons from orthogonal GaAs nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for emerging quantum technologies, enabling secure communication and enhanced sensing. For decades, generating polarization entangled states has been mainly achieved using bulk crystals with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), preventing scalability and on-chip integration. Miniaturizing the quantum source provides access to more versatility and tunability while enabling an easier integration to other devices, notably necessary for satellite-based quantum communication, and eventually reducing fabrication costs. This challenging task can be achieved with Zinc Blende GaAs nanowires. They already have shown an efficient photon pairs generation via SPDC at 1550 nm. Here we demonstrate that a pair of orthogonal GaAs nanowires constitutes a new nanoscale platform to control the quantum state at telecommunication wavelength, enabling a transition from polarization entangled to separable states as a function of the pump polarization, with fidelities reaching 90%</description>

      <title>Plasmonic nanopore to monitor in-pore chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In solid-state nanopores, achieving reliable control over pore aperture opening and closing (gating) remains a major challenge. Gating can be driven by the applied voltage involving electrically tunable chemical reactions, achieved by selecting appropriate compounds within the nanopore volume. In particular, cyclic precipitation and dissolution of metal phosphates can be triggered by regulating cation transport through an applied transmembrane voltage, thereby enabling reversible pore gating. Under negative bias, metal phosphate precipitates form inside the pore, obstructing ion flow and reducing current. Switching the polarity dissolves the precipitates, restoring ionic conductance. This process effectively produces a nanofluidic diode characterized by a remarkably high rectification ratio. To probe these localized chemical reactions more directly, we employed a plasmonic nanopore that generates strong confined fields, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements within the nanopore volume during cyclic gating. These measurements not only validate the proposed in-pore chemistry but also highlight the potential of plasmonic nanopores as powerful tools for monitoring nanoscale chemical processes with high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumps and universal geometry-induced drift velocity in multi-sliding quasi-periodic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantized Thouless pumps in periodic systems, set by Chern numbers or Wannier-center winding, is by now fairly well established, whereas its quasi-periodic extensions still require further clarification. Here, we develop a general quantitative paradigm for bulk Thouless pumps in continuous models with spacetime quasi-periodicity, applicable to arbitrary spatial dimensions. Within this framework, the bulk pumping turns out to be governed by an emergent long wave-length effective potential. Based on this mechanism, we obtain our main result a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi Brillouin zone. Reduced to periodic systems, our result gives an explicit and compact formula which enables us to directly calculate Chern numbers by microscopic data. These proposals are corroborated by simulations of one- and two-dimensional continuous moir\'e-type spacetime quasi-periodic lattices, which exhibit stable, localized, directional drift in excellent agreement with the theory.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation from two weakly coupled molecules: a simple tight-binding model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of high harmonics is a strongly nonlinear effect that allows to probe properties of the target and to study electron dynamics in matter. It has been investigated in many different kinds of targets, including molecular gases, liquids and solids. Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states.</description>

      <title>Topological Pseudospin Hall Effect and Multi-frequency Corner Modes in Kagome-based Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases and modes, including pseudospin-Hall-selective edge transport and corner states, provide robust control of wave propagation and modal confinement in classical wave platforms. Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Universality and Falsifiability of Quantum Spacetime Decoherence: A Gauge-Invariant Framework for Gravitational-Wave Phase Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully gauge-invariant and rigorously derived framework for computing the cumulative decoherence of gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through a stochastic quantum spacetime. Working directly with the Riemann-tensor two-point function and exploiting the extreme adiabaticity of cosmological GW propagation, we show that phase diffusion, rather than amplitude attenuation or mode mixing, is the unique leading-order imprint of microscopic curvature fluctuations. Our main theoretical result is a universality theorem: for any quantum-gravity model whose curvature fluctuations possess a finite correlation length, the accumulated phase variance grows linearly with distance, independent of the underlying microphysics. This diffusive scaling contrasts sharply with coherent astrophysical effects and with nonlocal models. The frequency exponent therefore becomes a clean spectral discriminator, separating string-foam recoil, holographic or scale-invariant noise, and causal-set discreteness. We obtain these results from first principles by evaluating the projected Riemann correlator along null geodesics and determining the exact conditions under which deviations from universality can arise. Finally, we outline a hierarchical Bayesian strategy for measuring this effect with LIGO, LISA, and Pulsar Timing Arrays. Although standard Planck-scale fluctuations remain far below current sensitivity, this framework provides a sharp and falsifiable test of exotic quantum-spacetime scenarios, particularly those with macroscopic correlation lengths or strong energy dependence.</description>

      <title>Exciton spin structure in lead halide perovskite semiconductors explored via the spin dynamics in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin structure and spin dynamics of excitons in bulk lead halide perovskite semiconductors with cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic crystal symmetry. The exciton spin structure and its modification by an external magnetic field are modeled for different regimes defined by the relative magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction (splitting between dark and bright states) and the Zeeman spin splitting. The effects of crystal symmetry and magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystal axes are considered for lead halide perovskite crystals with band gaps in the range 1.4 - 3.5 eV, having different ratios of electron and hole g-factors. For cubic symmetry, in a longitudinal magnetic field, our theory predicts quantum beats between the bright exciton states under linearly polarized excitation and detection, while the dark exciton remains optically inactive. In a transverse magnetic field, all exciton spin states become optically active and can be excited by circularly polarized light. Reduction of the crystal symmetry leads to a zero-field offset of the exciton Larmor precession frequencies, modifying the Zeeman splitting energy dependence on magnetic field. This theoretical framework allows for the extraction of the strength of the exchange interaction and the crystal symmetry. Experimentally, we measure the exciton spin coherence via time-resolved photoluminescence at a temperature of 1.6 K in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields in orthorhombic MAPbI3 crystals. Polarization beats at the frequency of the bright exciton are observed in both configurations. Comparison with theory indicates that the excitons are in the strong exchange interaction regime, and the reduction of symmetry does not lead to a significant splitting of the exciton spin levels.</description>

      <title>Electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in Dirac electron tunneling transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bistability-two distinct stable states under identical parameter-is not only a fundamental physical concept but also of importance in practical applications. While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching.</description>

Abstract: We present design principles for ultrashort-pulse, type-0 phase-matched optical parametric amplifiers to generate and measure spectrally pure degenerate squeezed light. We consider a fundamental signal (second-harmonic) mode at 2090 (1045) nm and show that our proposed design achieves a Schmidt number of $K \approx 1.02$ with squeezing levels greater than 15 dB on a single temporal mode spanning over $5$ THz in bandwidth with cm-scale devices on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) on insulator platform. Our work opens up promising avenues for large-scale circuits for ultrafast quantum information processing and quantum sensing applications on the rapidly advancing TFLN platform with already demonstrated linear components and photodetection capabilities.</description>

Abstract: We present multi-mode deep-strong coupling in a multi-quantum well (N=166) heterostructure. The heterostructure itself acts as a Fabry-Perot cavity, for which the even cavity modes strongly couple to the cyclotron resonance to form Landau polaritons. The experimentally observed vacuum Rabi splitting is larger than the mode spacing and well into the deep-strong coupling regime ($\eta&gt;1$) resulting in a rich multi-mode polaritonic spectrum which is accurately reproduced by an all-to-all multi-photonic, multi-electronic Hopfield coupling model. Remarkably, light-matter decoupling is observed across the whole measurable spectrum, including in the low frequency limit ($\lambda&gt;&gt;L_{cav}$) where the normalized coupling strength reaches $\eta=8.1$. The system demonstrates a robust platform for exploring extreme coupling regimes and its chiral nature holds potential for chiral cavity and chiral mirror applications.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of measured 3x3 partial depolarizing Mueller matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mueller polarimetry is a powerful technique with broad applications in astronomy, remote sensing, advanced material analysis, and biomedical imaging. However, instrumental constraints frequently restrict the measurement to an incomplete Mueller matrix limited to its upper-left 3x3 submatrix. Simply padding the missing entries with zeros to form a 4x4 matrix can produce physically inconsistent results, even for nondepolarizing systems. To address this issue, we present a systematic procedure to complete 3x3 measured Mueller matrices into physically consistent 4x4 matrices. The method relies on the covariance matrix formalism and selects, among the infinitely many admissible completions, the one with maximal polarimetric purity. This criterion ensures that the synthesized matrix corresponds to the least random (most deterministic) model compatible with the measurement. The procedure is fully general and can be applied to any 3x3 partial Mueller polarimetric data, providing a reliable and physically grounded reconstruction tool for polarimetric imaging and materials characterization.</description>

Abstract: Coherent control of quantum emitters is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter (SUPER) scheme allows efficient and coherent preparation of single photons via off-resonant, red-detuned laser pulses, simplifying laser suppression and enhancing photon collection. We present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs quantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. We perform a comparison of the key figures of merit against the well-established two-photon excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation powers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion of the exciton state ($\sim$95%) and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$) comparable to that under TPE, while also exhibiting a shortened decay time ($\sim$200 ps) reducing the time jitter in the exciton population. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that when both excitation and collection are aligned with one of the exciton dipoles, SUPER results in polarized single-photon emission, exceeding the resonant TPE saturation by a factor of 1.45. Under optimized excitation conditions, we also observe biexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by the appearance of the biexciton emission line, constituting the first experimental demonstration of biexciton preparation using SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a proposed four-level theoretical model that incorporates the biexciton state. We also report that a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an additional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton dipole, without altering the nominal excitation polarization. This unexpected behavior reveals a new degree of freedom for coherent state preparation. Our findings establish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and biexciton control.</description>

      <title>Full vectorial field sensing using liquid crystal droplet arrays</title>

Abstract: Determining the amplitude, phase, and polarization profile of light is essential for both fundamental scientific discovery and applications spanning optical metrology, microscopy, astronomy, and optical communication/computing technologies. However, most modern measurement approaches are unable to retrieve such parameters readily, often relying on bulky and expensive hardware, or lacking the capability for single-shot sensing. Here, we introduce a low cost, compact, full vectorial field sensor based on an inkjet-printed nematic liquid crystal droplet array that enables simultaneous measurement of these important characteristics of light. Polarization and intensity are measured via division-of-wavefront polarimetry, exploiting the droplets' spatially varying birefringence, while the phase is reconstructed by treating each droplet as a separate microlens in a Shack-Hartmann-like wavefront sensor configuration. To demonstrate the system's performance, we characterize aberrated dual-wavelength beams carrying distinct intensity, phase, and polarization information, confirming accurate retrieval of the optical field profiles for both spectral components.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Gradient Imaging Using a Nonlocal Metasurface System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Here, we present a compact quantum phase-gradient imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. By leveraging nonlocal resonances, the LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with all-optically angularly tunable emission, while the Si metasurface provides a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) that differentiates the photon wavefunction and extracts phase gradients.Experimental proof-of-concept results demonstrate the imaging of up to 25~rad/mm phase gradients, achieving 89% similarity with the reference values. The pixel resolution of the system can be potentially enhanced by orders of magnitude by increasing the metasurface dimensions and resonance quality factor.Our work showcases the application of metasurfaces in both generating and detecting quantum states and establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in quantum sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR technology.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Optical Entanglement Facilitated by Opto-Mechanical Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optomechanical generation of entangled optical beams is usually hindered by thermal noise. We present a theoretical study of low frequency entanglement generation between two optical harmonics emitted from a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved-sideband regime. The system comprises three nearly equidistant optical modes in a high-finesse cavity, with the central mode coherently driven. This configuration enables radiation-pressure interactions that generate strong quantum correlations between the two sideband modes. Remarkably, these correlations persist even at large numbers of thermal quanta if one properly engineers the optical cooling rate of the mechanical mode. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of robust entanglement under ambient conditions, opening new avenues for hybrid quantum technologies based on mechanical interfaces and continuous-variable quantum information processing.</description>
