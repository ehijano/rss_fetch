      <title>Gated MoS2/SiN Nanochannel for Tunable Ion Transport and Protein Translocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic transport in nanofluidic channels holds great promise for applications such as single-molecule analysis, molecular manipulation, and energy harvesting. However, achieving precise control over ion transport remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a MoS2 SiN hybrid nanochannel architecture that enables electrical tuning of ionic transport via external gating, and we examine its potential for osmotic power generation and single molecule detection. To fabricate the channels, we employed a combined focused ion beam (FIB) milling and dry transfer method, producing sub 10 nm thick structures while preserving the structural integrity and electronic properties of MoS2, essential for reliable surface charge modulation. We first investigated how the gate voltage influences ionic conductance, finding evidence of gate dependent modulation of ion selectivity under different bias polarities. Next, by applying a salt concentration gradient across the nanochannels, we demonstrated the feasibility of this platform for osmotic energy harvesting. Finally, we tested the system for single molecule sensing, showing that linearized bovine serum albumin (BSA) produced translocation signals with notably long dwell times. Together, these results highlight gated MoS2 SiN nanochannels as a promising platform for tunable nanofluidics, with potential applications in controlled molecular transport and energy harvesting from osmotic gradients.</description>

      <title>Predicting the optimal noise strength for solving optimization problems with analog Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog Ising machines are dedicated hardware solvers designed to solve NP hard optimization problems. However, the global optimum is often not found as the system gets stuck in local minima. While several strategies exist to increase the chance of escaping local minima, often these methods needs extensive parameter tuning. In this work, we investigate the injection of large noise as a scheme on its own and in combination with annealing to improve the success rate and the time-to-solution (TTS) of analog Ising machines for MaxCut problems. We demonstrate that optimizing the noise improves the TTS by several orders and makes both approaches competitive with the state-of-the-art, such as chaotic amplitude control. Moreover, we are able to predict a good noise value based on the problem connectivity and coupling strength, eliminating the need for costly parameter optimization.</description>

      <title>Time Domain Design of a Josephson Parametric Amplifier and Comparison with Input Output Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-limited amplifiers, such as Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPAs) and Joseph- son Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs), are essential components in quantum computers. They amplify low-power microwave signals from qubits at the 10 mK stage before further amplification at the 4 K stage using HEMT amplifiers. In JPAs, parametric amplification is based on the nonlinear properties of Josephson Junctions. While JPAs are typically designed and analyzed using input-output theory based on quantum physics, we propose an alternative approach based on an equivalent circuit model of JPAs, implemented using open-source Josephson circuit simula- tors. We compare the results with those obtained from input- output theory. This method enables the use of circuit optimizers for various objective functions and significantly reduces design time compared to quantum theory-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Enzyme-free in situ polymerization of conductive polymers catalyzed by porous Au@Ag nanowires for stretchable neural electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In situ polymerization of conductive polymers (CPs) represents a transformative approach in bioelectronics, by enabling the controlled growth of electrically active materials right at the tissue or device surface to create seamless biotic-abiotic interfaces. Traditional CP deposition techniques often use high anodic potentials, non-physiological electrolytes, or strong oxidants, making them harmful to adjacent tissues. A possible solution is enzymatic polymerization which operates under milder conditions, but it is limited by the stability and activity window of the enzyme catalysts, low throughput, and challenges in spatially confining polymer growth. To resolve these issues, here we developed one-dimensional porous Au-coated Ag nanowires with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-like catalytic properties, thereby for the first time enabling mild in situ enzyme-free polymerization of conductive polymers near neutral pH. The enzyme-free polymerization is demonstrated both in aqueous dispersions at pH=6 and in situ onto porous Au coated Ag nanowire based stretchable electrodes. Following enzyme-free catalytic polymerization, the electrically conducting polymer coating on the electrode greatly improves the impedance and achieves an impedance of 2.6 kOhm at 1 kHz for 50x50 um large electrodes.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in creeping salt crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-amplifying creeping of salts can produce striking macroscopic structures, such as desert roses in arid regions and salt pillars near saline lakes. While these formations are visually remarkable, salt crystallization, often seen as efflorescence on surfaces, also poses significant challenges for cultural heritage conservation, materials science, and soil management. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms underlying self-organized crystallization within efflorescence deposits. Our findings reveal that these porous salt deposits exhibit pronounced self-similarity, with the crystallization process recurring at multiple length scales. This results in smaller replicas of the overall structure nested within larger ones, creating fractal geometries similar to those found in cauliflower and broccoli. By performing controlled evaporation experiments and microscale analysis using advanced imaging techniques combined with fractal dimension analysis, we uncover the hierarchical and size-controlled precipitation of cubic microcrystals within the porous efflorescence. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical growth model demonstrating that the ultimate height of the macroscopic salt deposit is primarily determined by the initial mass of salt, rather than by the interplay of capillary and viscous forces when salt solution flows within the porous salt structure.</description>

      <title>Designing Antiferromagnetic Spin-1/2 Chains in Janus Fullerene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We computationally design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the linear arrangement of spin-$1/2$ C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the exploration of many-body quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Lattice vacancy migration barriers in Fe-Ni alloys, and why Ni atoms diffuse slowly: An ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mobility of both Fe and Ni atoms in ferromagnetic $\textrm{Fe}_x \textrm{Ni}_{1-x}$ alloys ($0.4 \leq x \leq 0.6$) is investigated within the framework of ab initio electronic structure calculations, using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to accurately quantify energetic barriers to lattice vacancy migration. Both the atomically disordered ($A1$) fcc phase, as well as the atomically ordered, tetragonal $\textrm{L}1_0$ phase - which is under consideration as a material for a rare-earth-free 'gap' magnet for advanced engineering applications - are investigated. Across an ensemble of NEB calculations performed on supercell configurations spanning a range of compositions and containing disordered, partially ordered, and fully ordered structures, we find that Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile than Fe atoms. Crucially, we are able to interpret these findings in terms of the ferromagnetic alloy's underlying spin-polarised electronic structure. Specifically, we report a coupling between the size of local lattice distortions and the magnitude of the local electronic spin polarisation around vacancies. This causes Fe atoms to relax into lattice vacancies, while Ni atoms remain rigidly fixed to their original lattice positions. This effect plays a key role in determining the reduced mobility of Ni atoms compared to that of Fe atoms. These results shed atomic-scale insight into the longstanding experimental observation that Ni exhibits remarkably slow atomic diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys.</description>

      <title>A microfluidic band-pass filter for flexible fiber separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous work has largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.</description>

      <title>Tailoring 4H-SiC Surface Electronic States by Atomic-Layer Deposition for Ideal Peta-Ohm Resistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High resolution resistors capable of detecting minuscule currents are vital for advanced sensors, but existing off-shelf models struggle with inconsistent resistance under varying voltages. The underlying physics of this issue is rooted in unstable surface charges and intrinsic inhomogeneity of surface potential caused by spontaneous polarization (SP) in commercial semi-insulating silicon carbide (SiC) devices. In this work, we found that coating SiC surfaces with an ultrathin zinc oxide layer immobilizes the dangling surface charges in place and balances the natural electric field of the material, ensuring stable resistance even at extreme voltages up to 1000 V. The resulting SiC resistor maintains a record-high resistance of one peta-ohm (10^15 {\Omega}) with negligible voltage fluctuations, outperforming conventional options. Additionally, these devices can switch states when exposed to light or heat, making them dual-purpose tools for ultra-sensitive measurements and sensors. This breakthrough combines high stability, scalability for mass production, and multifunctionality, opening doors to next-generation precision technologies in fields like quantum sensing and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Wave-based quasi-digital logic operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic wave-based computing has emerged as an exciting paradigm with the potential to enable high-speed, parallel operations. In conventional computing, elementary logic gates, such as AND, OR, NOT and XOR, form the building blocks of larger interconnected logic circuits. These operations are inherently non-linear processes, which may be challenging to implement using an electromagnetic wave-matter based systems. In this work, we discuss how one may instead emulate the functionality of certain logic gates by using quasi-digital linear systems (in this case networks of interconnected parallel plate waveguides). This is done by carefully designing the encoding scheme of the input bits (how the input state of each bit maps to an incident electromagnetic signal) and the high/low classification regions of the output signal. To demonstrate this approach, full-wave numerical simulation of elementary 2-input operations are presented. This technique is then extended to many-to-one and many-to-many operations such as an N-input AND, half, full and a 2-bit full-adder. We envision that this quasi-digital linear computing technique may help enable new opportunities for electromagnetic wave-based computing.</description>

      <title>First Steps Toward the Development of a Straight-Line Reference Alignment System for Future Accelerators at CERN Using Pseudo-Nondiffracting Layer Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents experimental results that allow for the performance evaluation of a straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams. Sensors, developed specifically for this system, feature four linear CMOS chips and a square aperture. This allows for simultaneous measurements along the beam path without disrupting the laser reference. Measurements, conducted over a distance of 2 m from the first to the last sensor, were compared with a laser tracker measurement to assess the sensor performance. The alignment reference generated by the Layer Beams exhibited a repeatability and reproducibility root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 30 ${\mu}$m. The relative alignment precision for a known displacement was validated with a standard deviation of 4.3 ${\mu}$m. The results highlight the underlying sources of noise, which are induced mainly by the cover glass, the protective film of the pixels, and the dark noise of the CMOS chips. Solutions to address these challenges are proposed. Additionally, a proof-of-concept for future development of a radiation-hard sensor utilizing optical fiber matrices is demonstrated. The RMSE of the reference position detection introduced by the fiber matrix remained below 1.3 ${\mu}$m. This would allow the sensor to be used reliably in high-radiation environments typical for accelerator facilities. This study serves as a foundational step toward developing a robust straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams intended for deployment in the accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>
