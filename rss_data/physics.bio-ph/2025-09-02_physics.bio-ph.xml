      <title>From spirals to flagellar beating: How pivot-like defects control semiflexible filament dynamics in motility assays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how localized pivot-like constraints regulate the dynamics of semiflexible filaments in two-dimensional motility assays. Motivated by rigor mutant motor proteins that remain bound but immobile, we model such constraints as pivot defects placed at arbitrary positions along the filament. Using large-scale simulations, we map out transitions between tightly coiled spirals and extended, flagella-like beating, controlled by pivot position, motor activity, and processivity. Spiral formation is characterized by bimodal turning number distributions and is stabilized by a balance between motor-driven activity and filament bending rigidity, with intermediate stiffness promoting robust spirals. We show that pivot defects act as an intermediate class of boundary condition, bridging free and clamped limits, and that their effects persist even when discretization is refined. While our model is minimal and does not include biochemical details, it provides a physically grounded framework for understanding how local pivot constraints reshape active polymer dynamics, yielding testable predictions for in-vitro molecular-motor assays</description>

      <title>Perfect adaptation in eukaryotic gradient sensing using cooperative allosteric binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eukaryotic cells generally sense chemical gradients using the binding of chemical ligands to membrane receptors. In order to perform chemotaxis effectively in different environments, cells need to adapt to different concentrations. We present a model of gradient sensing where the affinity of receptor-ligand binding is increased when a protein binds to the receptor's cytosolic side. This interior protein (allosteric factor) alters the sensitivity of the cell, allowing the cell to adapt to different ligand concentrations. We propose a reaction scheme where the cell alters the allosteric factor's availability to adapt the average fraction of bound receptors to 1/2. We calculate bounds on the chemotactic accuracy of the cell, and find that the cell can reach near-optimal chemotaxis over a broad range of concentrations. We find that the accuracy of chemotaxis depends strongly on the diffusion of the allosteric compound relative to other reaction rates. From this, we also find a trade-off between adaptation time and gradient sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>EEG Brain mapping based on the Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the EEG brain mapping technique based on the Duffing oscillator. For this purpose, we used EEG signals recorded from two musicians and two audience members in a music experiment. The Duffing oscillator was used to detect weak signals in the EEG signals. The frequency values of the weak signal were searched between 12 Hz and 37 Hz in all EEG channels of the participants. Then, topographical maps of the brain were generated according to the numbers of these weak signals detected. The results show that Duffing oscillator-based weak signal detection is a very effective tool for brain mapping. It shows that this method has great potential to help study various pathological conditions and understand the cognitive and behavioural functions of the human brain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace-fossil record serves as a rich dataset to examine fossil behaviour, ecologic interactions at community level, and evolutionary trends in behaviour across geological time. Behavioural adaptations are often invoked in a variety of evolutionary hypotheses; however, few methods to quantitatively compare fossil behaviour exist. Movement paths, such as trails and trackways, are well-studied in extant-organism research where they are discretized and mathematically analyzed for behavioural strategies and trends. Here, we reference modern movement ecology research and present a methodology to discretize horizontal movement paths in the fossil record. We then demonstrate the utility of this methodology and the spatiotemporal data it collects via an analysis of the trilobite trace fossil Cruziana semiplicata and assess our results in light of three previous assertions about its recorded behaviour. Our analysis reveals the presence of three morphotypes, interpreted as three distinct behavioural variations, which persisted across multiple geographic localities and are interpreted to reflect changes in external conditions, internal states, or a combination of the two. Our research highlights the immense potential of this methodology to test behavioural hypotheses and provides an open-source groundwork for future research.</description>

      <title>Spatial trends in Ediacaran Bilaterian trails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Savannah Hypothesis and the Cambrian Information Revolution invoke the development of spatially heterogeneous resource distribution during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition as a key driver of infaunalization and sensory evolution of mobile bilaterians, respectively. However, difficulties in detecting historical resource distribution hinders the ability to tests these theories. If external conditions crucial to organism fitness (e.g. nutrient distribution, oxygen availability) became increasingly heterogeneous across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, then it follows that benthic organisms dependent on these conditions would demonstrate a similar increase in the spatial variability of their movement trajectories. To investigate Ediacaran resource distribution on the seafloor we examined the morphology of Helminthoidichnites tenuis, a simple unbranched horizontal bilaterian trail, from the Ediacara Member of Southern Australia for spatial trends. Our analysis reveals a as-yet undiscovered variability in the behaviour of the Helminthoidichnites tenuis tracemaker and confirmed heterogeneity in external conditions relevant to the tracemaker in the latest Ediacaran.</description>

      <title>Structured Interactions Drive Abrupt Transitions in the Spatial Organization of Microbial Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria possess diverse mechanisms to regulate their motility in response to environmental and physiological signals, enabling them to navigate complex habitats and adapt their behavior. Among these mechanisms, interspecies recognition enables cells to modulate their movement based on the ecological identity of neighboring species. Here, we introduce a model in which we assume bacterial species recognizes each other and interact via local signals that either enhance or suppress the motility of neighboring cells. Through large-scale simulations and a coarse-grained stochastic model, we demonstrate the emergence of a sharp transition driven by nucleation processes: increasing the density of motility-suppressing interactions drives the system from a fully mixed, motile phase to a state characterized by large, stationary bacterial clusters. Remarkably, in systems with a large number of interacting species, this transition can be triggered solely by altering the structure of the motility-regulation interaction matrix while maintaining species and interaction densities constant. In particular, we find that heterogeneous and modular interactions promote the transition more readily than homogeneous random ones. These results contribute to the ongoing effort to understand microbial interactions, suggesting that structured, non-random ones may be key to reproducing commonly observed spatial patterns in microbial communities.</description>

      <title>Active sorting to boundaries in active nematic -- passive isotropic fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a two-fluid model to study a confined mixture of an active nematic fluid and a passive isotropic fluid. We find that an extensile active fluid preferentially accumulates at a boundary if the anchoring is planar, whereas its boundary concentration decreases for homeotropic anchoring. These tendencies are reversed if the active fluid is contractile. We argue that the sorting results from gradients in the nematic order, and show that the behaviour can be driven by either imposed boundary anchoring or spontaneous anchoring induced by active flows. Our results can be tested by experiments on microtubule-kinesin motor networks, and may be relevant to sorting to the boundary in cell colonies or cancer spheroids.</description>

      <title>Context dependent adaptation in a neural computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brains adapt to the statistical structure of their input. In the visual system, local light intensities change rapidly, the variance of the intensity changes more slowly, and the dynamic range of contrast itself changes more slowly still. We use a motion-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system to probe this hierarchy of adaptation phenomena, delivering naturalistic stimuli that have been simplified to have a clear separation of time scales. We show that the neural response to visual motion depends on contrast, and this dependence itself varies with context. Using the spike-triggered average velocity trajectory as a response measure, we find that context dependence is confined to a low-dimensional space, with a single dominant dimension. Across a wide range of conditions this adaptation serves to match the integration time to the mean interval between spikes, reducing redundancy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis of Taxis and Kinesis Properties of Colonial Protozoa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protozoan colonies undergo stimulus driven motion for purposes such as nutrient acquisition. Colonial response to a stimulus is mediated through a mechanical aggregation of the response properties of members of the colony. We develop and apply asymptotic analysis to a stochastic model for the integration of two classes of stimulus responses of the constituent cells -- taxis and kinesis. We investigate in particular the maintenance of effectiveness of taxis and kinesis in the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms, using experimental observations of chemotaxis and aerotaxis of protozoa as a reference. Our taxis model based on a steering response of individual cells actually leads to a counterproductive drift of the colony down the stimulus gradient, together with a constructive drift up the gradient which is proportional to a measure of asymmetry of the flagellar placement. The strength of taxis drift up the stimulus gradient decreases with colony size while the counterproductive term does not, indicating a failure for colonial taxis based on a steering response of individual cells. Under a kinesis response of the cellular flagellar motion, enhancing the noise as the cell is facing away from the stimulus gradient, the colony does drift up the gradient with a speed independent of colony size, even under a completely symmetric placement of flagella.</description>

      <title>Label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy revisits intracellular thermal dynamics: what do fluorescent nanothermometers measure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescent nanothermometry has revealed pronounced inhomogeneous temperature distributions within cells, establishing the field of single-cell thermal biology. However, this finding has sparked a controversial discussion known as the "10^5 gap issue", stemming from a simple heat conduction calculation suggesting such large temperature distributions should not exist within cells. Here, we address this issue using label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, which enables measurement of heat-induced temperature variations under local thermal equilibrium via micrometer-scale refractive index changes. First, we measured intracellular thermal diffusivity via transient thermal decay and determined that thermal diffusivity within living cells is 93-94% of water in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This result contradicts the hypothesis that intracellular thermal conduction is considerably slower than in water. Next, we compared fluorescent nanothermometry with our label-free microthermometry by measuring heat-induced temperature variations in living cells and found that the fluorescent nanothermometry exhibited a slowly varying signal in addition to a rapidly responding temperature change. This result clearly verifies that fluorescent nanothermometers are sensitive to an additional nonconductive factor beyond the temperature defined under local thermal equilibrium, exhibiting behavior inconsistent with thermal conduction. Our comparative measurements using fluorescent nanothermometry and label-free microthermometry suggest that this non-conductive factor may originate from slowly varying nanoscale dynamics within cells. Consequently, this work clarifies that the "10^5 gap issue" arises from comparing two fundamentally different physical quantities: the temperature defined under local thermal equilibrium and the non-conductive factor detected by fluorescent nanothermometers.</description>

      <title>A microsimulation model of behaviour change calibrated to reversal learning data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behaviour change lies at the heart of many observable collective phenomena such as the transmission and control of infectious diseases, adoption of public health policies, and migration of animals to new habitats. Representing the process of individual behaviour change in computer simulations of these phenomena remains an open challenge. Often, computational models use phenomenological implementations with limited support from behavioural data. Without a strong connection to observable quantities, such models have limited utility for simulating observed and counterfactual scenarios of emergent phenomena because they cannot be validated or calibrated. Here, we present a simple stochastic microsimulation model of reversal learning that captures fundamental properties of individual behaviour change, namely, the capacity to learn based on accumulated reward signals, and the transient persistence of learned behaviour after rewards are removed or altered. The model has only two parameters, and we use approximate Bayesian computation to demonstrate that they are fully identifiable from empirical reversal learning time series data. Finally, we demonstrate how the model can be extended to account for the increased complexity of behavioural dynamics over longer time scales involving fluctuating stimuli. This work is a step towards the development and evaluation of fully identifiable individual-level behaviour change models that can function as validated submodels for complex simulations of collective behaviour change.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic inference in molecular motors: a Martingale approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular motors are in charge of almost every process in the life cycle of cells, such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, and cell locomotion, hence being of crucial importance for understanding the cellular dynamics. However, given their size scales on the order of nanometers, direct measurements are rather challenging, and the information that can be extracted from them is limited. In this work, we propose strategies based on martingale theory in stochastic thermodynamics to infer thermodynamic properties of molecular motors using a limited amount of available information. In particular, we use two recent theoretical results valid for systems arbitrary far of equilibrium: the integral fluctuation theorem (IFT) at stopping times, and a family of bounds to the maximal excursions of entropy production. The potential of these strategies is illustrated with a simple model for the F1-ATPase rotary molecular motor, where our approach is able to estimate several quantities determining the thermodynamics of the motor, such as the rotational work of the motor performed against an externally applied force, or the effective environmental temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs), model systems for motor-driven filaments, have been extensively studied in uniform activity fields. Here, we show that an activity gradient breaks fore-aft symmetry, generating net body forces that steer dimers, asters, and larger assemblies toward high-activity regions. Including temporal stochasticity softens the chains, allowing them to bend and wind around other filaments. Once several contacts are established, steric interlocking arrests relative motion and stabilizes the assembly into a hierarchically entangled cluster. These clusters persist for times far exceeding single-chain relaxation and do not appear under deterministic, temporally constant activity. Remarkably, such activity-induced gelation occurs even at polymer concentrations substantially lower than those typically required for passive chains. Our results reveal a new mechanism for activity-induced aggregation, providing new strategies for designing autonomous and reconfigurable microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Results in Stochastic Processes with Division, Death, and Diffusion: Spatial Correlations, Marginal Entropy Production, and Macroscopic Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorem and optimal control of an active tracking particle with information processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling. We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived. Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system. Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.</description>
