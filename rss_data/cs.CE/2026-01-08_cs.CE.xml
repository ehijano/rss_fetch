      <title>SciNetBench: A Relation-Aware Benchmark for Scientific Literature Retrieval Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of AI agent has spurred the development of advanced research tools, such as Deep Research. Achieving this require a nuanced understanding of the relations within scientific literature, surpasses the scope of keyword-based or embedding-based retrieval. Existing retrieval agents mainly focus on the content-level similarities and are unable to decode critical relational dynamics, such as identifying corroborating or conflicting studies or tracing technological lineages, all of which are essential for a comprehensive literature review. Consequently, this fundamental limitation often results in a fragmented knowledge structure, misleading sentiment interpretation, and inadequate modeling of collective scientific progress. To investigate relation-aware retrieval more deeply, we propose SciNetBench, the first Scientific Network Relation-aware Benchmark for literature retrieval agents. Constructed from a corpus of over 18 million AI papers, our benchmark systematically evaluates three levels of relations: ego-centric retrieval of papers with novel knowledge structures, pair-wise identification of scholarly relationships, and path-wise reconstruction of scientific evolutionary trajectories. Through extensive evaluation of three categories of retrieval agents, we find that their accuracy on relation-aware retrieval tasks often falls below 20%, revealing a core shortcoming of current retrieval paradigms. Notably, further experiments on the literature review tasks demonstrate that providing agents with relational ground truth leads to a substantial 23.4% performance improvement in the review quality, validating the critical importance of relation-aware retrieval. We publicly release our benchmark at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SciNetBench/ to support future research on advanced retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>PIVONet: A Physically-Informed Variational Neuro ODE Model for Efficient Advection-Diffusion Fluid Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PIVONet (Physically-Informed Variational ODE Neural Network), a unified framework that integrates Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neuro-ODEs) with Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) for stochastic fluid simulation and visualization. First, we demonstrate that a physically informed model, parameterized by CNF parameters {\theta}, can be trained offline to yield an efficient surrogate simulator for a specific fluid system, eliminating the need to simulate the full dynamics explicitly. Second, by introducing a variational model with parameters {\phi} that captures latent stochasticity in observed fluid trajectories, we model the network output as a variational distribution and optimize a pathwise Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), enabling stochastic ODE integration that captures turbulence and random fluctuations in fluid motion (advection-diffusion behaviors).</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Decline Curve Analysis and Machine Learning for Temperature Forecasting in Enhanced Geothermal Systems: Utah FORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable temperature forecasting in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) is essential, yet petroleum-based decline curves and many machine-learning surrogates do not enforce geothermal heat transfer, while thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) simulation remains computationally expensive. This study proposes a physics-consistent framework that advances both decline-curve analysis and surrogate modeling. The classical Arps decline family is generalized for geothermal use by introducing an equilibrium-temperature term motivated by Newton-type cooling, ensuring finite late-time temperature limits while reducing exactly to the conventional Arps forms when the equilibrium term is set to zero. The extended decline curves are validated against Utah FORGE downhole temperature measurements and then used to construct learning surrogates on a controlled THM dataset spanning fracture count, well spacing, fracture spacing, host-rock thermal conductivity, and circulation rate. An equation-informed neural network embeds the modified decline equations as differentiable internal computational layers to produce full 0-60 month temperature trajectories from design and operational inputs. A probabilistic Gaussian Process Regression surrogate is also developed for direct multi-horizon forecasting with calibrated uncertainty, while a direct XGBoost regression baseline provides a purely data-driven reference. Across the simulation dataset, the extended decline models reproduce temperature trajectories with near-perfect fidelity (median RMSE = 0.071 {\deg}C), and the equation-informed network achieves typical hold-out errors of MAE = 3.06 {\deg}C and RMSE = 4.49 {\deg}C. The Gaussian Process surrogate delivers the strongest predictive accuracy across 3-60 month horizons (RMSE = 3.39 {\deg}C; MAE = 2.34 {\deg}C) with well-calibrated uncertainty, whereas the XGBoost baseline exhibits higher errors.</description>

      <title>All That Glisters Is Not Gold: A Benchmark for Reference-Free Counterfactual Financial Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce RFC Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on financial misinformation under realistic news. RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.</description>

      <title>Missing Physics Discovery through Fully Differentiable Finite Element-Based Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling complex physical systems through partial differential equations (PDEs) is central to many disciplines in science and engineering. Yet in most real applications, unknown or incomplete relationships such as constitutive or thermal laws, limits the description of the physics of interest. Existing surrogate modelling approaches aim to address this gap by learning the PDE solution directly from data (sometimes adding known physical constraints). However, these approaches are tailored to specific system configurations (e.g., geometries, boundary conditions, or discretisations) and do not directly learn the missing physics, but only the PDE solution. We introduce FEML, an end-to-end differentiable framework that combines PDE modelling of the system (known physics) with ML modelling of the operator representing the missing physics. By embedding a PDE solver into training, FEML can learn such operators from the PDE solution, even when operator outputs cannot be directly measured (e.g., stresses for learning constitutive models). FEML dissociates configuration-dependent PDE modelling from a configuration-agnostic operator shared across systems with the same hidden physics, enabling zero-shot generalisation of complex physical systems and supporting downstream study by domain specialists. Our framework uses structure-preserving operator networks (SPONs) to model the operator, preserving key continuous properties at the discrete level, learning over complex geometries and meshes, and generalising across different discretisations (mesh resolutions and/or FE discretisations). We showcase FEML and its versatility by recovering nonlinear stress-strain laws from synthetic laboratory tests, applying the learned model to a new mechanical scenario without retraining in a neat zero-shot setting, and identifying temperature-dependent conductivity in transient heat flow.</description>

      <title>Lenz effect in conductive nonmagnetic objects moved in MRI environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To model and predict the dynamics of conductive nonmagnetic objects moved within the MRI room under the influence of Lenz effect. High frequency motions, like vibrations induced by gradient eddy currents are not taken into account. Methods: The dynamics are described by an ordinary differential equation and the Lenz effect approximated under the assumption of negligible skin effect. This allows to separate the Lenz effect dependency on the object position and velocity, leading to a simple numerical procedure for objects of any shape. Results: The proposed model and numerical procedure were validated with experimental data recording the rotation of an aluminium plate falling inside a 1.5 T MRI scanner. The model was also applied for studying the translation of an aluminium plate pushed with constant force towards the MRI bore through the fringe field. Conclusion: The collected results showed that it is possible to obtain accurate predictions of motion in the presence of Lenz effect by neglecting the skin effect while determining the motional eddy currents induced in the metallic object.</description>

      <title>RAID-0e: A Resilient Striping Array Architecture for Balanced Performance and Availability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel disk array architecture, designated RAID-0e (Resilient Striping Array), designed to superimpose a low-overhead fault tolerance layer upon traditional RAID 0 (striping). By employing a logically and physically separate parity domain to protect a primary data domain, RAID-0e mitigates the risk of array-wide data loss from common, non-catastrophic media failures, such as isolated bad blocks, transient read errors, or sector-level corruption. The architecture is engineered to preserve the intrinsic read performance advantages of RAID 0 while significantly enhancing data availability and operational resilience. This document provides a comprehensive exposition of the architectural principles, operational workflows, performance characteristics, failure mode analysis, and security considerations of RAID-0e. It is presented as an experimental yet pragmatic solution for environments seeking a new equilibrium between I/O performance, storage cost, and data resilience, particularly where full drive failure is a secondary concern to media degradation.</description>

      <title>MDAgent2: Large Language Model for Code Generation and Knowledge Q&amp;A in Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding atomic-scale behaviors in materials science, yet writing LAMMPS scripts remains highly specialized and time-consuming tasks. Although LLMs show promise in code generation and domain-specific question answering, their performance in MD scenarios is limited by scarce domain data, the high deployment cost of state-of-the-art LLMs, and low code executability. Building upon our prior MDAgent, we present MDAgent2, the first end-to-end framework capable of performing both knowledge Q&amp;A and code generation within the MD domain. We construct a domain-specific data-construction pipeline that yields three high-quality datasets spanning MD knowledge, question answering, and code generation. Based on these datasets, we adopt a three stage post-training strategy--continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL)--to train two domain-adapted models, MD-Instruct and MD-Code. Furthermore, we introduce MD-GRPO, a closed-loop RL method that leverages simulation outcomes as reward signals and recycles low-reward trajectories for continual refinement. We further build MDAgent2-RUNTIME, a deployable multi-agent system that integrates code generation, execution, evaluation, and self-correction. Together with MD-EvalBench proposed in this work, the first benchmark for LAMMPS code generation and question answering, our models and system achieve performance surpassing several strong baselines.This work systematically demonstrates the adaptability and generalization capability of large language models in industrial simulation tasks, laying a methodological foundation for automatic code generation in AI for Science and industrial-scale simulations.

This article presents a computational tool designed for the simulation and analysis of these electrochemical systems. Based on the generalization and optimization of an existing 2D finite difference model for calculating electrical variables in rectangular cells, a new 3D model capable of processing complex geometries, not necessarily rectangular, has been developed. At the same time, a new analytical method for estimating potentials in floating electrodes is introduced, overcoming the inaccuracies of previous heuristic approaches. The analysis of the results is supported by an interactive visualization technique of three-dimensional vector fields as flow lines.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning catalyzes a revolution in chemical and biological science. However, its efficacy heavily depends on the availability of labeled data, and annotating biochemical data is extremely laborious. To surmount this data sparsity challenge, we present an instructive learning algorithm named InstructMol to measure pseudo-labels' reliability and help the target model leverage large-scale unlabeled data. InstructMol does not require transferring knowledge between multiple domains, which avoids the potential gap between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages. We demonstrated the high accuracy of InstructMol on several real-world molecular datasets and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. Code is available at~ https://github.com/smiles724/InstructMol.</description>

      <title>FinTagging: Benchmarking LLMs for Extracting and Structuring Financial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of numerical data in financial reports is critical for markets and regulators. Although XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) provides a standard for tagging financial figures, mapping thousands of facts to over ten thousand US-GAAP concepts remains costly and error-prone. Existing benchmarks oversimplify this task as flat, single-step classification over small subsets of concepts, ignoring the hierarchical semantics of the taxonomy and the structured nature of financial documents. As a result, these benchmarks fail to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) under realistic reporting conditions. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinTagging, the first comprehensive benchmark for structure-aware and full-scope XBRL tagging. We decompose the complex tagging process into two subtasks: (1) FinNI (Financial Numeric Identification), which extracts entities and types from heterogeneous contexts such as text and tables; and (2) FinCL (Financial Concept Linking), which maps extracted entities to the full US-GAAP taxonomy. This two-stage formulation enables a fair assessment of LLM capabilities in numerical reasoning and taxonomy alignment. Evaluating diverse LLMs in zero-shot settings shows that while models generalize well in extraction, they struggle with fine-grained concept linking, revealing important limitations in domain-specific, structure-aware reasoning. Code is available on GitHub, and datasets are available on Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>ChartAgent: A Multimodal Agent for Visually Grounded Reasoning in Complex Chart Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts-those requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual shortcuts. To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial domain. Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations, cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask. This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for chart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07% absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries. Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse chart types, (b) achieves the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts performance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using tool-augmented multimodal agents.</description>

However, existing directed evolution methods largely rely on heuristic evolution strategies and have yet to efficiently integrate the transformative protein language models with advanced optimization techniques, such as reinforcement learning, to adaptively learn superior evolution policies. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework that evolves protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models, such as fine-tuning and test-time inference. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility of the interested protein family. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. A case study further demonstrates that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space of avGFP through computational evolution.</description>
