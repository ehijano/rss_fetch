      <title>Radii of Mirror Nuclei and Isobaric Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a review of absolute root-mean-square charge radii of stable nuclei up to $Z=32$, which includes a previously overlooked uncertainty in the combined analysis of muonic x-ray and electron scattering experiments. From these \textit{reference radii} and isotope shift measurements, we obtain those of 12 mirror pairs with a traceable and realistic uncertainty budget. The difference in radii between mirror nuclei is found to be proportional to the isospin asymmetry, confirming recent calculations by Novario \emph{et al.} [PRL~130, 032501]. From the fitted proportionality constant and its uncertainty, the radii of 73 previously unknown mirror partners are predicted. These are useful e.g. for benchmarking atomic and nuclear theory, calibrating entire chains, and as an input to nuclear beta-decay calculations. The radii of $(T=1,T_z=0)$ nuclei are interpolated assuming negligible isospin symmetry breaking. This completes a model-independent, high-precision extraction of the charge and weak radii of all nuclei involved in the testing of the unitarity of the CKM matrix.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Selection Bias in Inclusive Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first-ever measurement of energy correlators within inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions, revealed by the CMS Collaboration, shows a clear enhancement at large angles relative to the proton-proton (p-p) baseline. However, interpreting this enhancement is complicated due to selection bias from energy loss, which also distorts the energy correlator heavy-ion to p-p ratio in the hadronization region, hindering our understanding of parton/hadron dynamics in a colored medium. In this Letter, we introduce a new ratio of energy correlator observables that removes the leading effects of selection bias from the two-point energy correlator spectrum (E2C). Pythia and Herwig simulations show that the impact of selection bias in the E2C is reduced by an order of magnitude, while sensitivity to any other medium modifications is retained. This quantity can be obtained directly from the experimental measurements presented by CMS, as illustrated in the accompanying note.</description>

Abstract: This note serves as a companion to a Letter, where we introduce a new energy correlator-based observable designed to minimize the impact of selection bias due to energy loss in inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Here, we apply the method outlined in the Letter to the first-ever measurement of energy correlators in heavy-ion collisions, recently released by the CMS Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Color transparency in hard $pd$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the predictions of perturbative QCD, the effect of color transparency has been the focus of attention in the community studying modifications of hadrons in nuclear medium for several decades. The search for this effect in reactions involving heavy nuclei can be complicated by uncertainties in nuclear characteristics (nucleon density distributions and wave functions), which can affect the interpretation of experiments. In this work, we consider the reaction $d(p,pp)n$ at $p_{\rm lab}=15$ GeV/c caused by hard elastic $pp$ scattering, in which these uncertainties are actually reduced to the behavior of the deuteron wave function at large momenta. It is shown that for transverse momenta of the spectator neutron $\leq 0.4$ GeV/c the choice of the deuteron wave function cannot affect the identification of the color transparency effect. A simple method for studying color transparency in $dd$ collisions is also suggested based on the identification of quasi-free $pd$ interactions.</description>

      <title>Unified study of nucleon and $\Delta$ baryon spectra and their strong decays with chiral dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we systematically study both the mass spectra and strong decays of the nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances up to the $N=2$ shell within a unified quark model framework with chiral dynamics. In this framework we achieve a good description of the strong decay properties of the well-established nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances. Meanwhile, the mass reversal between $N(1440)1/2^{+}$ as the first radial excitation state and the $1P$-wave nucleon resonances can be explained. We show that the three-body spin-orbit potential arising from the one-gluon exchange can cause a large configuration mixing between $N(1520)3/2^-$ and $N(1700)3/2^-$, and is also responsible for the large splitting between $\Delta(1600)1/2^-$ and $\Delta(1700)1/2^-$. Some of these baryon resonances turn to weakly couple to the $N\pi$, $N\eta$, $K\Lambda$, and $K\Sigma$ channels, which may answer the question why they have not been established in these channels via the $\pi N$ and $\gamma N$ scatterings. It shows that these ``missing resonances" may have large potentials to be established in the $N\pi\pi$ final state due to their large decay rates into either the $\Delta(1232)$ or $1P$-wave nucleon resonances via the pionic decays. Further experimental search for their signals in charmonium decays at BESIII is thus strongly recommended.</description>

      <title>First Extraction of Transverse Momentum Dependent Helicity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first global analysis of transverse momentum dependent helicity distributions of the proton. The analysis is performed at next-to-leading order with the evolution factor at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Nonzero signals are determined for up and down quarks and their $k_T$-integrated polarization are consistent with analyses in collinear factorization, while the distributions of other flavors are loosely constrained by existing data. With increasing transverse momentum, quarks at large $x$ become less polarized while those at small $x$ become more polarized.</description>

      <title>Converting sWeights to Probabilities with Density Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning approaches continues to have many benefits in experimental nuclear and particle physics. One common issue is generating training data which is sufficiently realistic to give reliable results. Here we advocate using real experimental data as the source of training data and demonstrate how one might subtract background contributions through the use of probabilistic weights which can be readily applied to training data. The sPlot formalism is a common tool used to isolate distributions from different sources. However, negative sWeights produced by the sPlot technique can lead to issues in training and poor predictive power. This article demonstrates how density ratio estimation can be applied to convert sWeights to event probabilities, which we call drWeights. The drWeights can then be applied to produce the distributions of interest and are consistent with direct use of the sWeights. This article will also show how decision trees are particular well suited to converting sWeights, with the benefit of fast prediction rates and adaptability to aspects of the experimental data such as data sample size and proportions of different event sources. We also show that a double density ratio approach where the initial drWeights are reweighted by an additional classifier gives substantially better results.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort laser-induced nuclear reactions: initiating decay of helium nuclei and subsequent fusion reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method to construct particle accelerators targeting light atoms and nuclei using high-power femtosecond laser pulses. Initially, we confine light atoms within the laser pulse envelope due to longitudinal polarization forces, allowing them to acquire kinetic energies of several GeV. Subsequently, an external electric field separates the nuclei at the cathode, concentrating helium nuclei in a small area. The kinetic energy of the 1.88 GeV impacts, exceeding the alpha particle binding energy (28 MeV) by two orders of magnitude, induces powerful gamma radiation and neutron emission from decay processes. This experiment marks a demonstration of a laser-induced decay method for helium nuclei for the first time. Moreover, helium isotopes or deuterium nuclei trapped on the cathode show significantly reduced Coulomb repulsion, enabling subsequent nuclear fusion reactions and substantial nuclear energy release.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Spin-trap isomers in deformed, odd-odd nuclei in the light rare-earth region near $N=98$"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new isomeric $(4^-)$ state at 285.5(32) keV in $^{162}$Tb was reported by R. Orford et al. [Phys. Rev. C 102, 011303(R) (2020)] based on a Penning-trap mass measurement. Here we show that this result is not compatible with existing experimental data. The state identified as $^{162}$Tb$^{m}$ with a mass-excess value of $-65593.9(25)$ keV is actually the $1^-$ ground state. The state identified as the ground state of $^{162}$Tb is most likely a molecular contaminant with the same mass-over-charge ratio.</description>

      <title>First Indication of Solar $^8$B Neutrino Flux through Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering in PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PandaX-4T liquid xenon detector at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory is used to measure the solar $^8$B neutrino flux by detecting neutrinos through coherent scattering with xenon nuclei. Data samples requiring the coincidence of scintillation and ionization signals (paired), as well as unpaired ionization-only signals (US2), are selected with energy threshold of approximately 1.1 keV (0.33 keV) nuclear recoil energy. Combining the commissioning run and the first science run of PandaX-4T, a total exposure of 1.20 and 1.04 tonne$\cdot$year are collected for the paired and US2, respectively. After unblinding, 3 and 332 events are observed with an expectation of 2.8$\pm$0.5 and 251$\pm$32 background events, for the paired and US2 data, respectively. A combined analysis yields a best-fit $^8$B neutrino signal of 3.5 (75) events from the paired (US2) data sample, with $\sim$37\% uncertainty, and the background-only hypothesis is disfavored at 2.64$\sigma$ significance. This gives a solar $^8$B neutrino flux of ($8.4\pm3.1$)$\times$10$^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, consistent with the standard solar model prediction. It is also the first indication of solar $^8$B neutrino ``fog'' in a dark matter direct detection experiment.</description>
