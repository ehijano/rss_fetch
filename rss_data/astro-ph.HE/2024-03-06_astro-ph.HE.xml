      <title>Final Moments II: Observational Properties and Physical Modeling of CSM-Interacting Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared observations and modeling of Type II supernovae (SNe II) whose early-time ($\delta t &lt; 2$ days) spectra show transient, narrow emission lines from shock ionization of confined ($r &lt; 10^{15}$ cm) circumstellar material (CSM). The observed electron-scattering broadened line profiles (i.e., IIn-like) of HI, He I/II, C III/IV, and N III/IV/V from the CSM persist on a characteristic timescale ($t_{\rm IIn}$) that marks a transition to a lower-density CSM and the emergence of Doppler-broadened features from the fast-moving SN ejecta. Our sample, the largest to date, consists of 39 SNe with early-time IIn-like features in addition to 35 "comparison" SNe with no evidence of early-time IIn-like features, all with ultraviolet observations. The total sample consists of 50 unpublished objects with 474 previously unpublished spectra and 50 multiband light curves, collected primarily through the Young Supernova Experiment and Global Supernova Project collaborations. For all sample objects, we find a significant correlation between peak ultraviolet brightness and both $t_{\rm IIn}$ and the rise time, as well as evidence for enhanced peak luminosities in SNe II with IIn-like features. We quantify mass-loss rates and CSM density for the sample through matching of peak multiband absolute magnitudes, rise times, $t_{\rm IIn}$ and optical SN spectra with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nLTE) radiative-transfer simulations. For our grid of models, all with the same underlying explosion, there is a trend between the duration of the electron-scattering broadened line profiles and inferred mass-loss rate: $t_{\rm IIn} \approx 3.8[\dot{M}/(0.01 \textrm{M}_{\odot} \textrm{yr}^{-1})]$ days.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Jet Formation in binary systems applying 3D MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of an ideal magnetized jet that originates from a disk acting as a boundary by conducting axisymmetric MHD simulations. Our simulations demonstrate that the magnetized jet is consistently launched and reaches a stable state. We extended the model setup to three dimensions to further advance our study. We performed 3D MHD simulations of the jet launched from a disk surface, achieving a stable and appropriate model setup. Additionally, we expanded our study by incorporating the companion star and examining the influence of the Roche potential on the jet material. Specifically, we investigate whether including the companion star in the model significantly affects the dynamical evolution of the jet. Our findings reveal the formation of an ``arc-like'' structure in the density map of the jet cross-section, which is attributed to the direct tidal effects. This implies that while the primary physical effects and characteristics of the outflow on a larger scale are attributed to the host accretion disk, the direct tidal effects on the jet dynamics have a substantial impact, particularly in the vicinity of the Roche lobe and towards the secondary star.</description>

      <title>Impact of unmodeled eccentricity on the tidal deformability measurement and implications for gravitational wave physics inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the expected large number of binary neutron star (BNS) observations through gravitational waves (GWs), third-generation GW detectors, Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), will be able to constrain the tidal deformability, and hence the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star (NS) with exquisite precision. A subset of the detected BNS systems can retain residual eccentricity in the detector frequency band. We study the systematic errors due to unmodeled eccentricity in the tidal deformability measurement and its implications for NS EoS and redshift measurement via the Love siren method. We find that the systematic errors in the tidal deformability parameter exceed the statistical errors at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ ($\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$) at $10$Hz reference GW frequency for CE (ET). We show that these biases on tidal deformability parameter can significantly bias the NS EoS inference. Furthermore, the error on tidal deformability propagates to the source frame NS mass, which in turn biases the redshift inference. For CE, the redshift inference is significantly biased at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ (at a reference frequency of $10$Hz). We also study the implications of biased tidal deformability in testing the Kerr nature of black holes. Systematic error on the tidal deformability parameter leads to a non-zero value of tidal deformability for binary black holes, indicating a false deviation from the Kerr nature. Finally, we show that including eccentricity in the waveform model increases the statistical errors in tidal deformability measurement by a factor of $\lesssim 2$. Our study, therefore, highlights the importance of using accurate eccentric waveform models for GW parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray diffusion in two local filamentary clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fairly uniform cosmic-ray (CR) distribution is observed near the Sun, except in the nearby Eridu cloud, which shows an unexplained 30-50% deficit in GeV to TeV CR flux. To explore the origin of this deficit, we studied the Reticulum cloud, which shares notable traits with Eridu: a comparable distance in the low-density region of the Local Valley and a filamentary structure of atomic hydrogen extending along ordered magnetic-field lines that are steeply inclined to the Galactic plane. Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.16 to 63 GeV energy band, we found that the gamma-ray emissivity in the Reticulum cloud is fully consistent with the average spectrum measured in the solar neighbourhood, but this emissivity, and therefore the CR flux, is 1.57 $\pm$ 0.09 times larger than in Eridu across the whole energy band. The difference cannot be attributed to uncertainties in gas mass. Nevertheless, we find that the two clouds are similar in many respects at a parsec scale: both have magnetic-field strengths of a few micro-Gauss in the plane of the sky; both are in approximate equilibrium between magnetic and thermal pressures; they have similar turbulent velocities and sonic Mach numbers; and both show magnetic-field regularity with a dispersion in orientation lower than 10-15 degrees over large zones. The gas in Reticulum is colder and denser than in Eridu, but we find similar parallel diffusion coefficients around a few times 1e28 cm2/s in both clouds if CRs above 1 GV in rigidity diffuse on resonant, self-excited Alfv\'en waves that are damped by ion-neutral interactions. The loss of CRs in Eridu remains unexplained, but these two clouds provide important test cases to further study how magnetic turbulence, line tangling, and ion-neutral damping regulate CR diffusion in the dominant gas phase of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Improved modeling of in-ice particle showers for IceCube event reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory relies on an array of photomultiplier tubes to detect Cherenkov light produced by charged particles in the South Pole ice. IceCube data analyses depend on an in-depth characterization of the glacial ice, and on novel approaches in event reconstruction that utilize fast approximations of photoelectron yields. Here, a more accurate model is derived for event reconstruction that better captures our current knowledge of ice optical properties. When evaluated on a Monte Carlo simulation set, the median angular resolution for in-ice particle showers improves by over a factor of three compared to a reconstruction based on a simplified model of the ice. The most substantial improvement is obtained when including effects of birefringence due to the polycrystalline structure of the ice. When evaluated on data classified as particle showers in the high-energy starting events sample, a significantly improved description of the events is observed.</description>

      <title>Observation of Seven Astrophysical Tau Neutrino Candidates with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a measurement of astrophysical tau neutrinos with 9.7 years of IceCube data. Using convolutional neural networks trained on images derived from simulated events, seven candidate $\nu_\tau$ events were found with visible energies ranging from roughly 20 TeV to 1 PeV and a median expected parent $\nu_\tau$ energy of about 200 TeV. Considering backgrounds from astrophysical and atmospheric neutrinos, and muons from $\pi^\pm/K^\pm$ decays in atmospheric air showers, we obtain a total estimated background of about 0.5 events, dominated by non-$\nu_\tau$ astrophysical neutrinos. Thus, we rule out the absence of astrophysical $\nu_\tau$ at the $5\sigma$ level. The measured astrophysical $\nu_\tau$ flux is consistent with expectations based on previously published IceCube astrophysical neutrino flux measurements and neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Effect of dark matter on the shadow of a distorted and deformed compact object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates observational properties, namely the shadow and photon ring structure, of emission profiles originated near compact objects. In particular, we consider a distorted and deformed compact object characterized by quadrupoles and surrounded by an optically thin and geometrically thin accretion disk with different emission profiles modeled by the Johnson's Standard-Unbound (SU) distribution in the reference frame of the emitter. Under these assumptions, we produce the observed intensity profiles and shadow images for a face-on observer. Our results indicate that, due to the fact that modifications of the quadrupole parameters affect the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the photon sphere (PS), the observed shadow images and their properties are significantly influenced by the quadrupole parameters and emission profiles. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the presence of a dark matter halo in the observational imprints considered and verify that both the increase in the matter contained in the halo or decrease in the length-scale of the halo lead to an increase in the size of the observed shadow. Our results indicate potential degeneracies between the observational features of distorded and deformed compact objects with those of spherically symmetric blackholes, which could be assessed by a comparison with the current and future generation of optical experiments in gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous millisecond-duration radio pulses with extragalactic origin, which were discovered more than a decade ago. Despite the numerous samples, the physical origin of FRBs remains poorly understood. FRBs have been thought to originate from young magnetars or accreting compact objects (COs). Massive stars or COs are predicted to be embedded in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The dense disk absorbs FRBs severely, making them difficult to observe. However, progenitors ejecta or outflow feedback from the accreting COs interact with the disk material to form a cavity. The existence of the cavity can reduce the absorption by the dense disk materials, making FRBs escape. Here we investigate the production and propagation of FRBs in AGN disks and find that the AGN environments lead to the following unique observational properties, which can be verified in future observation. First, the dense material in the disk can cause large dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM). Second, the toroidal magnetic field in the AGN disk can cause Faraday conversion. Third, during the shock breakout, DM and RM show non-power-law evolution patterns over time. Fourth, for accreting-powered models, higher accretion rates lead to more bright bursts in AGN disks.</description>

      <title>The GMRT High-Resolution Southern Sky Survey for pulsars and transients -- VII: Timing of Spider MSP J1242-4712, A Bridge Between Redback and Black Widow Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the timing solution for the 5.31-ms spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1242-4712, discovered with the GMRT. PSR J1242-4712 orbits a companion of minimum mass 0.08 M$_{\odot}$ with an orbital period of 7.7 hrs and occupies a relatively unexplored region in the orbital period versus companion mass space. We did not detect gamma-ray pulsations for this MSP, and also could not identify the optical counterpart for PSR J1242-4712 in available optical/near-infrared data. The profile of J1242-4712 evolves with frequency showing a clear single component at lower frequencies and a three-component profile at 650 MHz. PSR J1242-4712 eclipses for a very short duration near superior conjunction (orbital phase ~ 0.23-0.25) below 360 MHz. Moreover, significant DM delays and errors in pulse times of arrivals are observed near inferior conjunction (orbital phase ~ 0.7), along with an observed eclipse in one epoch at 650 MHz. Observed eclipses and significant orbital period variability suggest that PSR J1242-4712 is possibly not a He-WD binary, but has a semi or non-degenerate companion, indicating that this is a ``spider" MSP lying in a region between typical black widows and redbacks. This system may represent a distinct category of spider MSPs, displaying characteristics that bridge the gap between known black widow and redback MSPs.</description>

      <title>The bright black hole X-ray binary 4U 1543-47 during 2021 outburst. A clear state transition from super-Eddington to sub-Eddington accretion revealed by Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the observations with the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope of the black hole X-ray transient 4U~1543-47 during its outburst in 2021. We find a clear state transition during the outburst decay of the source. Using previous measurements of the black-hole mass and distance to the source, the source luminosity during this transition is close to the Eddington limit. The light curves before and after the transition can be fitted by two exponential functions with short ($\sim 16$ days) and long ($\sim 130$ days) decay time scales, respectively. We detect strong reflection features in all observations that can be described with either the RelxillNS or Reflionx_bb reflection models, both of which have a black-body incident spectrum. In the super-Eddington state, we observe a Comptonized component characterized by a low electron temperature of approximately 2.0 keV. We suggest that this component appears exclusively within the inner radiation-pressure dominated region of the supercritical disk as a part of the intrinsic spectrum of the accretion disk itself. This feature vanishes as the source transitions into the sub-Eddington state. The emissivity index of the accretion disk in the reflection component is significantly different before and after the transition, $\sim3.0$-$5.0$ and $\sim7.0$-$9.0$ in the super- and sub-Eddington states, respectively. Based on the reflection geometry of returning disk radiation, the geometrically thicker the accretion disk, the smaller the emissivity index. Therefore, we propose that the transition is primarily driven by the change of the accretion flow from a supercritical to a thin disk configuration.</description>

      <title>SLICK: Strong Lensing Identification of Candidates Kindred in gravitational wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the end of the next decade, we hope to have detected strongly lensed gravitational waves by galaxies or clusters. Although there exist optimal methods for identifying lensed signal, it is shown that machine learning (ML) algorithms can give comparable performance but are orders of magnitude faster than non-ML methods. We present the SLICK pipeline which comprises a parallel network based on deep learning. We analyse the Q-transform maps (QT maps) and the Sine-Gaussian maps (SGP-maps) generated for the binary black hole signals injected in Gaussian as well as real noise. We compare our network performance with the previous work and find that the efficiency of our model is higher by a factor of 5 at a false positive rate of 0.001. Further, we show that including SGP maps with QT maps data results in a better performance than analysing QT maps alone. When combined with sky localisation constraints, we hope to get unprecedented accuracy in the predictions than previously possible. We also evaluate our model on the real events detected by the LIGO--Virgo collaboration and find that our network correctly classifies all of them, consistent with non-detection of lensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption of light is one of the main selection effects limiting our ability to detect celestial sources, and ultimately, appearance of the sky across most of the electromagnetic spectrum. Recent advances in quantity and quality of available observational data and analysis methods led to major improvements in resolution, depth and fidelity of 3D dust distribution and extinction maps. The Galactic plane remains, however, essentially ``terra incognita'' beyond distances of a few kilo-parsecs due to the strong absorption in optical and near-infrared bands. Here I attempt to address this issue and present a 3D-$N_{\rm H}$-tool to estimate line of sight reddening and X-ray absorption column combining state of the art optical extinction and dust emission maps, and the results of dispersion measure modeling based on radio pulsar observations. The resulting maps are calibrated using independent absorption tracers and are accessible to general community via a convenient web-interface and full data cube.</description>

      <title>Signatures of ultralight bosons in the orbital eccentricity of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of clouds of ultralight particles surrounding black holes during their cosmological history as members of a binary system can leave a measurable imprint on the distribution of masses and orbital eccentricities observable with future gravitational-wave detectors. Notably, we find that for nonprecessing binaries with chirp masses ${\cal M} \lesssim 10\,M_\odot$, formed exclusively in isolation, larger-than-expected values of the eccentricity, i.e. $e\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ at gravitational-wave frequencies $f_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-2}\,$Hz, would provide tantalizing evidence for a new particle of mass between $[0.5,2.5] \times 10^{-12}\,$eV in nature. The predicted evolution of the eccentricity can also drastically affect the in-band phase evolution and peak frequency. These results constitute unique signatures of boson clouds of ultralight particles in the dynamics of binary black holes, which will be readily accessible with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, as well as future mid-band and Deci-hertz detectors.</description>

      <title>Compact stars in Rastall gravity: Hydrostatic equilibrium and radial pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of Rastall gravity, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium and dynamical stability against radial pulsations of compact stars, where a free parameter $\beta$ measures the deviations from General Relativity (GR). We derive both the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and the Sturm-Liouville differential equation governing the adiabatic radial oscillations. Such equations are solved numerically in order to obtain the compact-star properties for two realistic equations of state (EoSs). For hadronic matter, the fundamental mode frequency $\omega_0$ becomes unstable almost at the critical central energy density corresponding to the maximum gravitational mass. However, for quark matter, where larger values of $\vert\beta\vert$ are required to observe appreciable changes in the mass-radius diagram, there exist stable stars after the maximum-mass configuration for negative values of $\beta$. Using an independent analysis, our results reveal that the emergence of a cusp can be used as a criterion to indicate the onset of instability when the binding energy is plotted as a function of the proper mass. Specifically, we find that the central-density value where the binding energy is a minimum corresponds precisely to $\omega_0^2 =0$.</description>

      <title>Light Thermal Dark Matter Beyond $p$-Wave Annihilation in Minimal Higgs Portal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores a minimal renormalizable dark matter (DM) model, incorporating a sub-GeV Majorana DM and a singlet scalar particle $\phi$. Using scalar and pseudo-scalar interactions (couplings $c_s$ and $c_p$), we investigate implications for DM detection, considering $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and combined ($s$+$p$ wave) contributions in DM annihilation cross-section, as well as loop-correction contributions to DM-nucleon elastic scattering. Identifying a broad parameter space ($10 \,\rm{MeV} &lt; m_\chi \lesssim m_\phi$) within the $2\sigma$ allowed region, we explore scenarios ($\left|c_s\right|\gg \left|c_p\right|$, $\left|c_s\right|\ll \left|c_p\right|$, and $\left|c_s\right|\approx \left|c_p\right|$). We find that (i) a non-zero pseudo-scalar coupling alleviates direct detection constraints as a comparison with the previous pure scalar coupling case; (ii) CMB observations set stringent limits on pseudo-scalar interaction dominant cases, making $s$-wave annihilation viable only for $m_\chi&gt;1\,\rm{GeV}$; (iii) the preferred $\phi$-resonance region can be tested in the future indirect detection experiments, such as e-ASTROGAM.</description>

      <title>Cold Filaments Formed in Hot Wake Flows Uplifted by AGN Bubbles in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength observations indicate that the intracluster medium in some galaxy clusters contains cold filaments, while their formation mechanism remains debated. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show that cold filaments could naturally condense out of hot gaseous wake flows uplifted by the jet-inflated active galactic nucleus (AGN) bubbles. Consistent with observations, the simulated filaments extend to tens of kpc from the cluster center, with a representative mass of $\rm 10^{8}- 10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ for a typical AGN outburst energy of $10^{60}~ \rm erg$. They show smooth velocity gradients, stretching typically from inner inflows to outer outflows with velocity dispersions of several hundred $\rm km\ s^{-1}$. The properties of cold filaments are affected substantially by jet properties. Compared to kinetic energy-dominated jets, thermal energy-dominated jets tend to produce longer cold filaments with higher masses. With the same jet energy, AGN jets with an earlier turn-on time, a lower jet base, or a higher power heat the cluster center more effectively, and produce shorter filaments at a much later epoch.</description>

      <title>Targeted optimization in small-scale atomic structure calculations: application to Au I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of reliable atomic data can be a severe limitation in astrophysical modelling, in particular of events such as kilonovae that require information on all neutron-capture elements across a wide range of ionization stages. Notably, the presence of non-orthonormalities between electron orbitals representing configurations that are close in energy can introduce significant inaccuracies in computed energies and transition probabilities. Here, we propose an explicit targeted optimization method that can effectively circumvent this concern while retaining an orthonormal orbital basis set. We illustrate this method within the framework of small-scale atomic structure models of Au I, using the GRASP2018 multiconfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock atomic structure code. By comparing to conventional optimization schemes we show how a targeted optimization approach improves the energy level positioning and ordering. Targeted optimization also leads to better agreement with experimental data for the strongest E1 transitions. This illustrates how small-scale models can be significantly improved with minor computational costs if orbital non-orthonormalities are considered carefully. These results should prove useful to multi-element atomic structure calculations in, for example, astrophysical opacity applications involving neutron-capture elements.</description>

Abstract: We report new Very Large Array high-resolution observations of the radio jet from the outbursting high-mass star S255IR~NIRS3. The images at 6, 10, and 22.2 GHz confirm the existence of a new lobe emerging to the SW and expanding at a mean speed of ~285 km/s, about half as fast as the NE lobe. The new data allow us to reproduce both the morphology and the continuum spectrum of the two lobes with the model already adopted in our previous studies. We conclude that in all likelihood both lobes are powered by the same accretion outburst. We also find that the jet is currently fading down, recollimating, and recombining.</description>

Abstract: We describe the pioneering contributions of Thomas K. Gaisser to the birth and development of particle astrophysics, a new field of research at the intersection of cosmic ray physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and particle physics that has emerged in the last few decades. We will especially focus on his studies of natural beams of neutrinos: those generated by the interactions of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere and those emitted by astrophysical sources. Tom actively participated in the discovery of these cosmic neutrinos as well. His contributions also extend to gamma-ray astronomy, the study of the cosmic ray spectra and composition, and the modeling of cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere and in astrophysical environments. Tom invariably focused his research on the theoretical and phenomenological problems of greatest interest at the time, producing frameworks that transparently interpreted often complex data. These studies have been very influential and have shaped the development of the field.</description>

Abstract: Quasars and microquasars both contain accreting black holes and power nonthermal radio sources but differ in more than their scales: Quasars are proportionally much more efficient accelerators of energetic electrons. The radio luminosity of the double radio sources associated with quasars, reflecting the long-time average of the particle acceleration power, is often 1-30% of the quasar's bolometric luminosity; in microquasars the fraction is $\lesssim 10^{-5}$. This may be explained by the scaling of accretion disc parameters with the black hole mass.</description>

Abstract: We show how magnetic accretion of positronium (electron-positron) plasma by primordial black holes might significantly contribute to the mass of dark matter in the present Universe. Assuming that background gamma radiation is primordial black hole Hawking radiation rules out Bondi accretion, while magnetic accretion known from studies of active galactic nuclei could explain the abundance of dark matter. Various accretion scenarios are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spin-induced offset stream self-crossing shocks in tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events occur when a star is disrupted by a supermassive black hole, resulting in an elongated stream of gas that partly falls back to the pericenter. Due to apsidal precession, the returning stream may collide with itself, leading to a self-crossing shock that launches an outflow. If the black hole spins, this collision may additionally be affected by Lense-Thirring precession that can cause an offset between the two stream components. We study the impact of this effect on the outflow properties by carrying out local simulations of collisions between offset streams. As the offset increases, we find that the geometry of the outflow becomes less spherical and more collimated along the directions of the incoming streams, with less gas getting unbound by the interaction. However, even the most grazing collisions we consider significantly affect the trajectories of the colliding gas, likely promoting subsequent strong interactions near the black hole and rapid disc formation. We analytically compute the dependence of the offset to stream width ratio, finding that even slowly spinning black holes can cause both strong and grazing collisions. We estimate that the self-crossing shock luminosity is lower for an offset collision than an aligned one since radiation energy injected by the shock is significantly lower for more offset collisions. We find that the deviation from outflow sphericity may cause significant variations in the efficiency at which X-ray radiation from the disc is reprocessed to the optical band, depending on the viewing angle, and increase the degree of the observed polarization. These potentially observable features hold the promise of constraining the black hole spin from tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>TeV pion bumps in the gamma-ray spectra of flaring blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Abridged) Very high-energy (VHE, $E&gt;100$ GeV) observations of the blazar Mrk 501 with MAGIC in 2014 provided evidence for an unusual narrow spectral feature at about 3 TeV during an extreme X-ray flaring activity. The one-zone synchrotron-self Compton scenario, widely used in blazar broadband spectral modeling, fails to explain the narrow TeV component. Motivated by this rare observation, we propose an alternative model for the production of narrow features in the VHE spectra of flaring blazars. These spectral features may result from the decay of neutral pions ($\pi^0$ bumps) that are in turn produced via interactions of protons (of tens of TeV energy) with energetic photons, whose density increases during hard X-ray flares. We explored the conditions needed for the emergence of narrow $\pi^0$ bumps in VHE blazar spectra during X-ray flares reaching synchrotron energies $\sim 100$ keV using time-dependent radiative transfer calculations. We focused on high-synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazars, which comprise the majority of VHE-detected extragalactic sources. We find that synchrotron-dominated flares with peak energies $\gtrsim100$ keV can be ideal periods for the search of $\pi^0$ bumps in the VHE spectra of HSP blazars. The flaring region is optically thin to photopion production, its energy content is dominated by the relativistic proton population, and the inferred jet power is highly super-Eddington. Application of the model to the spectral energy distribution of Mrk 501 on MJD 56857.98 shows that the VHE spectrum of the flare is described well by the sum of a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) component and a distinct $\pi^0$ bump centered at 3 TeV. Spectral fitting of simulated SSC+$\pi^0$ spectra for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) show that a $\pi^0$ bump could be detected at a 5$\sigma$ significance level with a 30-min exposure.</description>

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) may undergo mixing with photons in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields, leading to alterations in the observed high energy $\gamma$-ray spectra. In this study, we investigate the ALP-photon oscillation effect using the spectra of the blazar Mrk 421 over 15 observation periods measured by Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes (MAGIC) and Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). Compared with previous studies, we generate mock data under the ALP hypothesis and employ the ${\rm CL_s}$ method to set constraints on the ALP parameters. This method is widely utilized in high energy experiments and avoids the exclusion of specific parameter regions where distinguishing between the null and ALP hypotheses is challenging. We find that the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ is constrained to be smaller than $\sim 2\times10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for ALP masses ranging from $10^{-9}$ eV to $10^{-7}$ eV at the 95\% confidence level. We also present the constraints derived from the TS distribution under the null hypothesis, which is commonly utilized in previous astrophysical ALP studies. Our results reveal that the combined constraints of all the periods obtained from both methods are consistent. However, the ${\rm CL_s}$ method remains effective in cases where the latter method fails to provide constraints for specific observation periods.</description>

Abstract: Sagittarius A* exhibits frequent flaring activity across the electromagnetic spectrum. Signatures of an orbiting hot spot have been identified in the polarized millimeter wavelength light curves observed with ALMA in 2017 immediately after an X-ray flare. The nature of these hot spots remains uncertain. We expanded existing theoretical hot-spot models created to describe the Sgr A* polarized emission at millimeter wavelengths. We sampled the posterior space, identifying best-fitting parameters and characterizing uncertainties. Using the numerical radiative transfer code ipole, we defined a semi-analytical model describing a ball of plasma orbiting Sgr A*, threaded with a magnetic field and emitting synchrotron radiation. We then explored the posterior space in the Bayesian framework of dynesty. We fit the static background emission separately, using a radiatively inefficient accretion flow model. We considered eight models with a varying level of complexity, distinguished by choices regarding dynamically important cooling, non-Keplerian motion, and magnetic field polarity. All models converge to realizations that fit the data, but one model without cooling, non-Keplerian motion, and magnetic field pointing toward us improved the fit significantly and also matched the observed circular polarization. Our models represent observational data well and allow testing various effects in a systematic manner. From our analysis, we have inferred an inclination of $155-160$ deg, which corroborates previous estimates, a preferred period of 90 minutes, and an orbital radius of $9-12$ gravitational radii. Our non-Keplerian models indicate a preference for an orbital velocity of $0.6-0.9$ times the Keplerian value. Last, all our models agree on a high dimensionless spin value ($a_{*}&gt;0.8$), but the impact of spin on the corresponding light curves is subdominant with respect to other parameters.</description>

      <title>The orbital evolution of the tidally stripped star and disk-driven stable mass transfer for QPEs in GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is possibly mass loss at the periastron of a body moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a high eccentric orbit. Such a tidally stripped star is expected to radiate gravitational wave thereby leading to shrinkage of the periastron distance, and thus will eventually be disrupted by the SMBH in the previous studies. This scenario predicts a gradually increasing mass transfer, contradicting the observed decay in the intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069. In this paper, we first revisited the orbital evolution of the stripped star. The effect of the mass transfer finally dominates the orbital evolution, resulting in the stripped star finally escaping the SMBH rather than being disrupted by it. Then we suggested a model of a tidal stripped WD moving inside an accretion disk for QPEs in GSN 069. The drag force by the disk can effectively reduce mass transfer and thus explain the observed decay in the intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069. The disk is likely a fallback disk of the tidal disruption event in GSN 069. Considering the evolution of its accretion rate, the increase in the intensity of the latest eruption can also be explained.</description>

      <title>Exploring extreme brightness variations in blue supergiant MACHO 80.7443.1718: Evidence for companion-driven enhanced mass loss</title>

Abstract: Evolution of massive stars is dominated by interactions within binary systems. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate all forms of interaction in binary systems that may affect the evolution of the components. One of such laboratories is the massive eccentric binary system MACHO$\,$80.7443.1718 (ExtEV). We examine whether the light variability of the ExtEV can be explained by a wind-wind collision (WWC) binary system model. We conducted an analysis of broadband multi-color photometry of ExtEV, time-series space photometry from TESS, ground-based Johnson $UBV$ photometry, and time-series spectroscopy. We fitted an analytical model of light variations to the TESS light curve of ExtEV. We rule out the possibility of the presence of a disk around the primary component. We also argue that the non-linear wave-breaking scenario may not be consistent with the observations of ExtEV. We refine the orbital parameters of ExtEV and find evidence for the presence of a tertiary component. Using evolutionary models we demonstrate that the primary component's mass is between 25 and 45$\,$M$_\odot$. We successfully reproduce light curve of ExtEV with our model, showing that the dominant processes shaping its light curve are atmospheric eclipse and light scattered in the WWC cone. We also estimate the primary's mass-loss rate due to stellar wind for $4.5\cdot 10^{-5}\,$M$_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We conclude that ExtEV is not an extreme eccentric ellipsoidal variable, but an exceptional WWC binary system. The mass loss rate we derived exceeds theoretical predictions by up to two orders of magnitude. This implies that the wind is likely enhanced by tidal interactions, rotation, and possibly also tidally excited oscillations. ExtEV represents a rare evolutionary phase of a binary system that may help to understand the role of a companion-driven enhanced mass loss in the evolution of massive binary systems.</description>

      <title>On the maximum black hole mass at solar metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18841</link>

Abstract: In high metallicity environments the mass that black holes (BHs) can reach just after core-collapse widely depends on how much mass their progenitor stars lose via winds. On one hand new theoretical and observational insights suggest that early-stage winds should be weaker than what many canonical models prescribe. On the other hand the proximity to the Eddington limit should affect the formation of optically thick envelopes already during the earliest stages of stars with initial masses $M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim 100$ M$_\odot$, hence resulting in higher mass-loss rates during the main sequence. We use the evolutionary codes MESA and Genec to calculate a suite of tracks for massive stars at solar metallicity Z$_\odot=0.014$ which incorporate these changes in our wind mass loss prescription. In our calculations we employ moderate rotation, high overshooting and magnetic angular momentum transport. We find a maximum BH mass $M_{\rm BH, max}=28.3$ M$_\odot$ at Z$_\odot$. The most massive BHs are predicted to form from stars with $M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim 250$ M$_\odot$, with the BH mass directly proportional to its progenitor's $M_{\rm ZAMS}$. We also find in our models that at Z$_\odot$ almost any BH progenitor naturally evolves into a Wolf-Rayet star due to the combined effect of internal mixing and wind mass loss. These results are considerably different from most recent studies regarding the final mass of stars before their collapse into BHs. While we acknowledge the inherent uncertainties in stellar evolution modelling, our study underscores the importance of employing the most up-to-date physics in BH mass predictions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of High-polarization Stars and Blazars with DIPOL-1 at Sierra Nevada Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report here the performance and first results of the new multiband optical polarimeter DIPOL-1, installed at the Sierra Nevada Observatory 90 cm T90 telescope (SNO, Granada, Spain). DIPOL-1 is equipped with a plane parallel calcite plate and $\lambda$/2 retarder for modulating the intensity of two perpendicularly polarized beams, and a high readout speed CMOS camera that allows for fast, time-dense coverage. We characterize the performance of this instrument through a series of tests on zero- and high-polarization standard stars. The instrumental polarization in the Nasmyth focus was well determined, with a very stable contribution of 4.0806% $\pm$ 0.0014% in the optical $R$ band. For bright high-polarization standards ($m_{R}&lt;8$) we reach precisions $&lt;$0.02% in polarization degree and 0.1$^{\circ}$ in polarization angle for exposures of 2$-$4 minutes. The polarization properties of these stars have been constrained, providing more recent results also about possible variability for future studies on some of the most used calibrators. Moreover, we have tested the capability of observing much fainter objects, in particular through blazar observations, where we reach a precision $&lt;$0.5$-$0.6% and $&lt;$0.5$^{\circ}$ for faint targets ($m_{R}\sim16.5$) with exposures of $\sim$1 hour. For brighter targets ($m_{R}\sim14.5-15$), we can aim for time-dense observations with errors $&lt;$$0.2-0.4$% and $&lt;$$1-1.5^{\circ}$ in 5-20 minutes. We have successfully performed a first campaign with DIPOL-1, detecting significant polarized emission of several blazars, with special attention to the highest ever polarization degree measured from blazar 3C~345 at $\sim$32%.</description>

      <title>A Lensing-Band Approach to Spacetime Constraints</title>

Abstract: General relativity's prediction that all black holes are described by the Kerr metric, irrespective of their size, can now be empirically tested using electromagnetic observations of supermassive black holes and gravitational waves from mergers of stellar-mass black holes. In this work, we focus on the electromagnetic side of this test and quantify the constraining power of very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) observations of emission generated by hot gas surrounding supermassive black holes. We demonstrate how to use lensing bands--annular regions on the observer's screen surrounding the critical curve--to constrain the underlying spacetime geometry. Contingent upon a detection of a lensed VLBI feature, the resulting lensing-band framework allows us to exclude spacetimes for which said feature cannot arise from geodesics that traversed the equatorial plane more than once. Focusing on the first indirect image and tests of black-hole uniqueness, we employ a parametrized spacetime as a case study. We find that resolving geometric information that goes beyond the apparent size of the critical curve has the potential to lift degeneracies between different spacetime parameters. Our work thereby quantifies a conservative estimate of the constraining power of VLBI measurements and contributes to a larger effort to simultaneously constrain geometry and astrophysics.</description>
