      <title>Record Responsivity-conductance Performance in Sub-bandgap-triggered Ga2O3 PCSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the role of anode grid pitch and excitation spectrum on the performance of high-power optoelectronic switches utilizing Fe-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$3$. By systematically varying the anode grid pitch ($20-80\ \mu\text{m}$) and the excitation spectrum ($235-500\ \text{nm}$), we identify a crucial sub-bandgap regime, centered at $272\ \text{nm}$, that effectively activates deep-level defect states. This activation is shown to enable highly efficient bulk carrier transport, a significant contrast to conventional above-bandgap excitation which is hampered by shallow surface absorption. The sub-bandgap illumination promotes strong photocurrent generation and substantially improved carrier collection efficiency. Under optimized conditions, specifically utilizing a $40\ \mu\text{m}$ anode pitch, the fabricated device achieves a high peak photocurrent of $4.14\ \text{A}$ and a record-low on-resistance of $10.4\ \Omega$. To quantify this simultaneous high-performance achievement, we introduce a responsivity-conductance figure of merit ($\text{FoM}{_{RC}}$), which attains a record value of $4.7 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{S/W}$. These findings robustly demonstrate the superior suitability of Fe-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ for next-generation high-power optoelectronic switching applications, enabling reliable ampere-level photocurrents coupled with minimized on-resistance through strategic device geometry optimization and sub-bandgap excitation.</description>

      <title>Electrified EHL line contact with dielectric breakdown of lubricant -- a numerical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the electric vehicles with drive systems with higher voltages, power outputs, frequencies, and speeds, mitigating electrically induced bearing damage (EIBD) in electric motors has become critical. In this study, a novel numerical model characterizing discharge-induced current density and voltage drop at the elastohydrodynamic lubrication line contact interface is presented. The current density and voltage drop constitute a linear complimentarily problem, which is efficiently solved using the conjugate gradient method. This paper sheds light on electrical characteristics at the inaccessible lubrication interface during discharge, highlighting the significance of roughness radius of curvature on current density. This numerical model lays the groundwork for future research on mitigating or even permanently solving EIBD problems in electric motor bearings.</description>

      <title>Worldwide Scientific Landscape on Fires in Photovoltaic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of photovoltaic (PV) technology in recent years called for a comprehensive assessment of the global scientific landscape on fires associated with PV energy installations. This study examines the scientific literature indexed in Scopus from 1983 to 2023. It reveals a striking increase in output since 2011, with nearly one hundred publications in the most recent year under review. This growth of interest has occurred in parallel with the global expansion of photovoltaics. The majority of studies in this field are classified as engineering, with 34% of publications in this area. The USA leads the way with over 160 publications, followed by China with 125. Two institutions in the USA are particularly prominent in this field: Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico with 22 publications, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado with 16 publications. The second institution is the University of Science and Technology of China, which has published 17 articles on the subject. A close examination of the evolution of keywords reveals a remarkable transformation in the scientific landscape over the past 10 years, from 2013 to 2023. The evolution of keywords suggests a maturation in the understanding of fire risks associated with photovoltaic energy. A total of seven scientific communities have been identified in which these works are grouped according to their keywords. These include Fire and Energy Storage, PV faults, Fire resistance, Fire hazard, Fire detectors, Deep learning, and Fire safety. It has been found that fires caused by PV installations are not listed as a cause of fire starts. This should be taken into account when conducting preventive analyses of this potential danger, particularly in light of the possible development of agrivoltaics, where facilities will be mainly located in the natural environment.</description>

      <title>Sensor free, self regulating thermal switching via anomalous Ettingshausen effect and spin reorientation in DyCo5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a sensor free, self regulating thermal switch that combines the anomalous Ettingshausen effect (AEE) with a temperature driven spin reorientation transition (SRT) in the rare earth cobalt compound DyCo$_5$. Using density functional theory and the Kubo linear-response formalism, we compute the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}(\varepsilon)$ and the finite temperature anomalous Nernst conductivity $\alpha_{xy}(T)$ for two magnetization directions, magnetization parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. While the intrinsic $\sigma_{xy}$ at the Fermi level remains sizable for both orientations, $\alpha_{xy}$ exhibits an about two orders of magnitude contrast in the SRT temperature window. This contrast is consistent with the low temperature Mott relation through the energy slope $\partial_\varepsilon \sigma_{xy}(\varepsilon)\rvert_{E_{\mathrm F}}$ and is traced to strongly peaked Berry curvature hot spots generated by spin orbit coupling induced avoided crossings of Co $3d$ bands. Combining $\alpha_{xy}$ with longitudinal transport coefficients, we estimate device level metrics, namely the anomalous Nernst thermopower $S_{\mathrm{ANE}}$ and the Ettingshausen coefficient $\Pi_{\mathrm{AEE}}=T S_{\mathrm{ANE}}$, and demonstrate robust orientation controlled switching under a fixed in plane bias current. These results establish a materials based route to compact thermal control without external sensors or feedback electronics and provide a concrete example that the proposed principle can be realized in an existing ferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Compact High-Efficiency All-Polarization Rectenna for Wireless Power Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present an innovative design for a compact, high-efficiency all-polarization receiving rectenna tailored for wireless power transmission. This rectenna, which integrates an antenna with two same rectifier units, employs direct conjugate matching of antenna impedance to rectifier impedance. This approach eliminates the necessity for an external impedance-matching network, thereby reducing the overall dimensions of the rectenna. The implementation of virtual ground concept streamlines the design of the rectifier's output filter. The low-profile antenna, engineered for operation at 2.45 GHz, demonstrates high conversion efficiency across all polarization angles. The measured RF-to-DC efficiency exceeds 63% for all polarization angles, achieving a peak efficiency of 82.2%.</description>

      <title>Seismic wave propagation in viscoelastic media under Atangana-Baleanu fractional dynamics: Model formulation and numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a one-dimensional viscoelastic seismic-wave model driven by the Atangana-BaleanuCaputo fractional derivative with a non-singular Mittag-Leffler kernel. A finite-difference discretization in space and an Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector scheme in time are used to compute solutions for several fractional orders. Simulations indicate that fractional memory alters both attenuation and dispersion, leading to non-exponential energy decay compared with the classical integer-order case.</description>

      <title>Intelligent matter consisting of active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this book chapter, we review how systems of simple motile agents can be used as a pathway to intelligent systems. It is a well known result from nature that large groups of entities following simple rules, such as swarms of animals, can give rise to much more complex collective behavior in a display of emergence. This begs the question whether we can emulate this behavior in synthetic matter and drive it to a point where the collective behavior reaches the complexity level of intelligent systems. Here, we will use a formalized notion of "intelligent matter" and compare it to recent results in the field of active matter. First, we will explore the approach of emergent computing in which specialized active matter systems are designed to directly solve a given task through emergent behavior. This we will then contrast with the approach of physical reservoir computing powered by the dynamics of active particle systems. In this context, we will also describe a novel reservoir computing scheme for active particles driven ultrasonically or via light refraction.</description>

      <title>FEL Gain Enhancement in an Optical Klystron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system comprising two identical helical or planar undulators separated by a gap -- viz., an optical klystron (OK) -- is investigated. A formula for the frequency distribution of spontaneous radiation at zero angle is derived. It is shown that the spontaneous radiation line shape gradually narrows with increasing distance (up to an optimal value) between the undulators due to the constructive interference of the radiation fields formed in each of them, while the number of radiated photons decreases. The free-electron laser (FEL) gain coefficient also gradually increases, since it is proportional to the derivative of the spontaneous radiation line shape. Using the undulator parameters of the SASE XFEL and the bunch parameters of the LCLS, the total gain coefficient in the X-ray range is on the order of 2.5 and, for a different electron energy, reaches approximately 90 in the water window frequency range.</description>

      <title>How nanotextured interfaces influence the electronics in perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have reached power conversion efficiencies that rival those of established silicon photovoltaics. Nanotextures in perovskite solar cells scatter the incident light, thereby improving optical absorption. In addition, experiments show that nanotextures impact electronic performance, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the underlying theoretical reasons by combining multi-dimensional optical and charge-transport simulations for a single-junction perovskite solar cell. Our numerical results reveal that texturing redistributes the electric field, influencing carrier accumulation and recombination dynamics. We find that moderate texturing heights ($\leq 300$ nm) always increase the power conversion efficiency, regardless of surface recombination velocities. Our study also clarifies why experiments have reported that texturing both increased and reduced open-circuit voltages in perovskite solar cells: this behaviour originates from variations in surface recombination at the untextured electron transport layer. In contrast, surface recombination at the textured hole transport layer strongly affects the short-circuit current density, with lower recombination rates keeping it closer to the optical ideal. These findings provide new insights into the opto-electronic advantages of texturing and offer guidance for the design of next-generation textured perovskite-based solar cells, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coulomb Blockade in Orbital Resolved Phosphorus Triple-Donor Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-donor architecture in silicon offers a promising direction towards scalable solid-state qubits and quantum technologies operating at practical conditions. However, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions develops a complex internal electronic configuration with several discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete-correlated states is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards their practical implementations in quantum-technologies. We have experimentally demonstrated quantum Coulomb blockade mediated systematic filling of several electrons into orbital-resolved molecular states within multi-phosphorous-donor molecules accompanied by a correlated decrement in charging energies for higher hybridized orbitals due to expanded Bohr radii and electron delocalization. Corresponding, first-principle density functional theory calculations offer microscopic insight into the orbital configurations, while the rate equation simulations of quantum Coulomb blockade faithfully reproduce the experimental stability diagrams. This comprehensive characterization advances and discusses the role of donor-molecules in silicon in scalable building blocks for quantum technologies operable at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation framework for modeling collective emission in ensembles of inhomogeneous solid-state emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient simulation framework is proposed to model collective emission in disordered ensembles of quantum emitters. Using a cumulant expansion approach, the computational complexity scales polynomially as opposed to exponentially with the number of emitters, enabling Monte Carlo sampling over a large number of realizations. The framework is applied to model negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{-}$) centers inside diamond. Incorporating spatial disorder and inhomogeneous broadening, we obtain statistically averaged responses over hundreds of SiV$^{-}$ clusters. These simulations reveal two signatures of collective behavior. First, dynamics of fully inverted clusters show that superradiant emission occurs only with sufficiently large emitter number and high quantum efficiency. Unlike ideal Dicke superradiance, the burst is substantially suppressed by strong near-field dipole-dipole interaction, consistent with existing theoretical predictions. Second, under continuous-wave excitation we compute photoluminescence-excitation spectra, which exhibit interaction-induced broadening in the distribution of resonance peaks. The corresponding density of states also displays a non-zero skewness. Overall, by incorporating realistic inhomogeneities in emitter clusters, our framework is able to predict statistics for disordered ensembles that can be compared to experiments directly. Our approach generalizes to other types of emitters, including atoms, molecules, and quantum dots, thus providing a practical tool for analyzing collective behavior in realistic quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We report validation tests of a calcium atomic beam source manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). We quantitatively evaluated the surface quality and elemental composition of the printed part and defined reference parameters for reliable operation in ultra-high vacuum.
