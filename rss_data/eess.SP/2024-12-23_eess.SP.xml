      <title>Multi-Branch Mutual-Distillation Transformer for EEG-Based Seizure Subtype Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) based seizure subtype classification is very important in precise epilepsy diagnostics. Deep learning is a promising solution, due to its ability to automatically extract latent patterns. However, it usually requires a large amount of training data, which may not always be available in clinical practice. This paper proposes Multi-Branch Mutual-Distillation (MBMD) Transformer for cross-subject EEG-based seizure subtype classification, which can be effectively trained from small labeled data. MBMD Transformer replaces all even-numbered encoder blocks of the vanilla Vision Transformer by our designed multi-branch encoder blocks. A mutual-distillation strategy is proposed to transfer knowledge between the raw EEG data and its wavelets of different frequency bands. Experiments on two public EEG datasets demonstrated that our proposed MBMD Transformer outperformed several traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first work on knowledge distillation for EEG-based seizure subtype classification.</description>

      <title>Confidence Intervals for the Savitzky-Golay Filter with an Application to the Keeling Data for Atmospheric CO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Savitzky-Golay FIR digital filter is based on a least-squares polynomial fit to a sample of equally spaced data. The polynomial fit gives the filter the ability to preserve moments of features in the data like peak width. However the S-G filter is not generally regarded as having a sound statistical basis. This puts the filter in the category of smoothing filters where the degree of smoothing depends on the somewhat arbitrary choice of the filter parameters. This arbitrariness makes the variance of the residuals between the filter input and output an unreliable estimate of the variance of the noise in the filter input. And without a reliable estimate of the input noise variance there is no basis for determining statistically meaningful confidence intervals on the filter output.
  This paper proposes a method of using the S-G filter to determine a reliable estimate of the variance of the noise in the data. This estimate is then used as the basis for selecting appropriate filter parameters and determining statistically meaningful confidence intervals on the filter output. To illustrate the proposed method an analysis of the Keeling measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentration is presented.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Network- and User-Centric Scalable Cell-Free Massive MIMO for Fronthaul Signaling Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) coordinates a great number of distributed access points (APs) with central processing units (CPUs), effectively reducing interference and ensuring uniform service quality for user equipment (UEs). However, its cooperative nature can result in intense fronthaul signaling between CPUs in large-scale networks. To reduce the inter-CPU fronthaul signaling for systems with limited fronthaul capacity, we propose a low-complexity online UE-AP association approach for scalable CFmMIMO that combines network- and user-centric clustering methodologies, relies on local channel information only, and can handle dynamic UE arrivals. Numerical results demonstrate that compared to the state-of-the-art method on fronthaul signaling minimization, our approach can save up to 94% of the fronthaul signaling load and 83% of the CPU processing power at the cost of only up to 8.6% spectral efficiency loss, or no loss in some cases.</description>

      <title>Resonant Beam Enabled Passive 3D Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the internet of things (IoT), location-based services are becoming increasingly prominent in various aspects of social life, and accurate location information is crucial. However, RF-based indoor positioning solutions are severely limited in positioning accuracy due to signal transmission losses and directional difficulties, and optical indoor positioning methods require high propagation conditions. To achieve higher accuracy in indoor positioning, we utilize the principle of resonance to design a triangulation-based resonant beam positioning system (TRBPS) in the RF band. The proposed system employs phase-conjugation antenna arrays and resonance mechanism to achieve energy concentration and beam self-alignment, without requiring active signals from the target for positioning and complex beam control algorithms. Numerical evaluations indicate that TRBPS can achieve millimeter-level accuracy within a range of 3.6 m without the need for additional embedded systems.</description>

      <title>Resonant Beam Multi-Target DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for internet of things (IoT) applications, especially for location-based services, how to locate passive mobile targets (MTs) with minimal beam control has become a challenge. Resonant beam systems are considered promising IoT technologies with advantages such as beam self-alignment and energy concentration. To establish a resonant system in the radio frequency (RF) band and achieve multi-target localization, this paper designs a multi-target resonant system architecture, allowing a single base station (BS) to independently connect with multiple MTs. By employing a retro-directive array, a multi-channel cyclic model is established to realize one-to-many electromagnetic wave propagation and MT direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation through echo resonance. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports resonant establishment between the BS and multiple MTs. This helps the BS to still have high DOA estimation accuracy in the face of multiple passive MTs, and can ensure that the DOA error is less than 1 degree within a range of 6 meters at a 50degree field of view, with higher accuracy than active beamforming localization systems.</description>

      <title>Broadband Passive Sonar Track-Before-Detect Using Raw Acoustic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article concerns the challenge of reliable broadband passive sonar target detection and tracking in complex acoustic environments. Addressing this challenge is becoming increasingly crucial for safeguarding underwater infrastructure, monitoring marine life, and providing defense during seabed warfare. To that end, a solution is proposed based on a vector-autoregressive model for the ambient noise and a heavy-tailed statistical model for the distribution of the raw hydrophone data. These models are integrated into a Bernoulli track-before-detect (TkBD) filter that estimates the probability of target existence, target bearing, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed solution is evaluated on both simulated and real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed ambient noise modeling and the statistical model for the raw hydrophone data samples to obtain early target detection and robust target tracking. The simulations show that the SNR at which the target can be detected is reduced by 4 dB compared to when using the standard constant false alarm rate detector-based tracker. Further, the test with real-world data shows that the proposed solution increases the target detection distance from 250 m to 390 m. The presented results illustrate that the TkBD technology, in combination with data-driven ambient noise modeling and heavy-tailed statistical signal models, can enable reliable broadband passive sonar target detection and tracking in complex acoustic environments and lower the SNR required to detect and track targets.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Hardware Impairments in Multi-User Systems: Can FAS Make a Difference?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the role of fluid antenna systems (FAS) in multi-user systems with hardware impairments (HIs). Specifically, we investigate a scenario where a base station (BS) equipped with multiple fluid antennas communicates with multiple users (CUs), each equipped with a single fluid antenna. Our objective is to maximize the minimum communication rate among all users by jointly optimizing the BS's transmit beamforming, the positions of its transmit fluid antennas, and the positions of the CUs' receive fluid antennas. To address this non-convex problem, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm integrating semidefinite relaxation (SDR), rank-one constraint relaxation (SRCR), successive convex approximation (SCA), and majorization-minimization (MM). Simulation results demonstrate that FAS significantly enhances system performance and robustness, with notable gains when both the BS and CUs are equipped with fluid antennas. Even under low transmit power conditions, deploying FAS at the BS alone yields substantial performance gains. However, the effectiveness of FAS depends on the availability of sufficient movement space, as space constraints may limit its benefits compared to fixed antenna strategies. Our findings highlight the potential of FAS to mitigate HIs and enhance multi-user system performance, while emphasizing the need for practical deployment considerations.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Belief Propagation Decoder for LDPC Codes with Small Variable Node Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient data processing by imitating the event-based behavior of biological neurons. In previous work, we introduced the enlarge-likelihood-each-notable-amplitude spiking-neural-network (ELENA-SNN) decoder, a novel decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The decoder integrates SNNs into belief propagation (BP) decoding by approximating the check node (CN) update equation using SNNs. However, when decoding LDPC codes with a small variable node(VN) degree, the approximation gets too rough, and the ELENA-SNN decoder does not yield good results. This paper introduces the multi-level ELENA-SNN (ML-ELENA-SNN) decoder, which is an extension of the ELENA-SNN decoder. Instead of a single SNN approximating the CN update, multiple SNNs are applied in parallel, resulting in a higher resolution and higher dynamic range of the exchanged messages. We show that the ML-ELENA-SNN decoder performs similarly to the ubiquitous normalized min-sum decoder for the (38400, 30720) regular LDPC code with a VN degree of dv = 3 and a CN degree of dc = 15.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Beyond Diagonal RIS: A Universal Framework Applicable to Arbitrary Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a promising technology for future wireless communication systems due to their ability to control the propagation environment in a hardware- and energy-efficient way. Recently, the concept of RISs has been extended to beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs), which unlock the full potential of RISs thanks to the presence of tunable interconnections between RIS elements. While various algorithms have been proposed for specific BD-RIS architectures, a universal optimization framework applicable to arbitrary architectures is still lacking. In this paper, we bridge this research gap by proposing an architecture-independent framework for BD-RIS optimization, with the main focus on sum-rate maximization and transmit power minimization in multiuser multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. Specifically, we first incorporate BD-RIS architectures into the models by connecting the scattering matrix with the admittance matrix and introducing appropriate constraints to the admittance matrix. The formulated problems are then solved by our custom-designed partially proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (pp-ADMM) algorithms. The pp-ADMM algorithms are computationally efficient, with each subproblem either admitting a closed-form solution or being easily solvable. We further explore the extension of the proposed framework to general utility functions and multiuser multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches achieve a better trade-off between performance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods. We also compare the performance of various BD-RIS architectures in MU-MISO systems using the proposed approach, which has not been explored before due to the lack of an architecture-independent framework.</description>

      <title>Distributed Beam Alignment in sub-THz D2D Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Devices in a device-to-device (D2D) network operating in sub-THz frequencies require knowledge of the spatial channel that connects them to their peers. Acquiring such high dimensional channel state information entails large overhead, which drastically increases with the number of network devices. In this paper, we propose an accelerated method to achieve network-wide beam alignment in an efficient way. To this aim, we consider compressed sensing estimation enabled by a novel design of pilot sequences. Our designed pilots have constant envelope to alleviate hardware requirements at the transmitters, while they exhibit a "comb-like"' spectrum that flexibly allocates energy only on certain frequencies. This design enables multiple devices to transmit thier pilots concurrently while remaining orthogonal in frequency, achieving simultaneous alignment of multiple devices. Furthermore, we present a sequential partitioning strategy into transmitters and receivers that results in logarithmic scaling of the overhead with the number of devices, as opposed to the conventional linear scaling. Finally, we show via accurate modeling of the indoor propagation environment and ray tracing simulations that the resulting sub-THz channels after successful beamforming are approximately frequency flat, therefore suitable for efficient single carrier transmission without equalization. We compare our results against an "802.11ad inspired" baseline and show that our method is capable to greatly reduce the number of pilots required to achieve network-wide alignment.</description>

      <title>Joint Task Offloading and Routing in Wireless Multi-hop Networks Using Biased Backpressure Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge for computation offloading in wireless multi-hop networks is the complex interaction among traffic flows in the presence of interference. Existing approaches often ignore these key effects and/or rely on outdated queueing and channel state information. To fill these gaps, we reformulate joint offloading and routing as a routing problem on an extended graph with physical and virtual links. We adopt the state-of-the-art shortest path-biased Backpressure routing algorithm, which allows the destination and the route of a job to be dynamically adjusted at every time step based on network-wide long-term information and real-time states of local neighborhoods. In large networks, our approach achieves smaller makespan than existing approaches, such as separated Backpressure offloading and joint offloading and routing based on linear programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cost and limited capacity of fronthaul links pose significant challenges for the deployment of ultra-dense networks (UDNs), specifically for cell-free massive MIMO systems. Hence, cost-effective planning of reliable fronthaul networks is crucial for the future deployment of UDNs. We propose an optimization framework for traffic-aware hybrid fronthaul network planning, aimed at minimizing total costs through a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that considers fiber optics and mmWave, along with optimizing key performance metrics. The results demonstrate superiority of the proposed approach, highlighting the cost-effectiveness and performance advantages when compared to different deployment schemes. Moreover, our results also reveal different trends that are critical for Service Providers (SPs) during the fronthaul planning phase of future-proof networks that can adapt to evolving traffic demands.</description>

      <title>Predicting Artificial Neural Network Representations to Learn Recognition Model for Music Identification from Brain Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the representations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) can exhibit notable similarities to cortical representations when subjected to identical auditory sensory inputs. In these studies, the ability to predict cortical representations is probed by regressing from ANN representations to cortical representations. Building upon this concept, our approach reverses the direction of prediction: we utilize ANN representations as a supervisory signal to train recognition models using noisy brain recordings obtained through non-invasive measurements. Specifically, we focus on constructing a recognition model for music identification, where electroencephalography (EEG) brain recordings collected during music listening serve as input. By training an EEG recognition model to predict ANN representations-representations associated with music identification-we observed a substantial improvement in classification accuracy. This study introduces a novel approach to developing recognition models for brain recordings in response to external auditory stimuli. It holds promise for advancing brain-computer interfaces (BCI), neural decoding techniques, and our understanding of music cognition. Furthermore, it provides new insights into the relationship between auditory brain activity and ANN representations.</description>

      <title>SODor: Long-Term EEG Partitioning for Seizure Onset Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have recently shown great success in classifying epileptic patients using EEG recordings. Unfortunately, classification-based methods lack a sound mechanism to detect the onset of seizure events. In this work, we propose a two-stage framework, \method, that explicitly models seizure onset through a novel task formulation of subsequence clustering. Given an EEG sequence, the framework first learns a set of second-level embeddings with label supervision. It then employs model-based clustering to explicitly capture long-term temporal dependencies in EEG sequences and identify meaningful subsequences. Epochs within a subsequence share a common cluster assignment (normal or seizure), with cluster or state transitions representing successful onset detections. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method can correct misclassifications, achieving 5%-11% classification improvements over other baselines and accurately detecting seizure onsets.</description>

      <title>TouchASP: Elastic Automatic Speech Perception that Everyone Can Touch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models demand a vast number of parameters, copious amounts of data, and significant computational resources during the training process. However, such models can merely be deployed on high-compute cloud platforms and are only capable of performing speech recognition tasks. This leads to high costs and restricted capabilities. In this report, we initially propose the elastic mixture of the expert (eMoE) model. This model can be trained just once and then be elastically scaled in accordance with deployment requirements. Secondly, we devise an unsupervised data creation and validation procedure and gather millions of hours of audio data from diverse domains for training. Using these two techniques, our system achieves elastic deployment capabilities while reducing the Character Error Rate (CER) on the SpeechIO testsets from 4.98\% to 2.45\%. Thirdly, our model is not only competent in Mandarin speech recognition but also proficient in multilingual, multi-dialect, emotion, gender, and sound event perception. We refer to this as Automatic Speech Perception (ASP), and the perception results are presented in the experimental section.</description>

      <title>Debiasing of Two-Line Element Sets for Batch Least Squares Pseudo-Orbit Determination in MEO and GEO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of accurate and timely state predictions for objects in near-Earth orbits is becoming increasingly important due to the growing congestion in key orbital regimes. The Two-line Element Set (TLE) catalogue remains, to this day, one of the few publicly-available, comprehensive sources of near-Earth object ephemerides. At the same time, TLEs are affected by measurement noise and are limited by the low accuracy of the SGP4 theory, introducing significant uncertainty into state predictions. Previous literature has shown that filtering TLEs with batch least squares methods can yield significant improvements in long-term state prediction accuracy. However, this process can be highly sensitive to TLE quality which can vary throughout the year. In this study, it is shown that either extended-duration fit windows of the order of months, or the removal of systematic biases in along-track position prior to state estimation can produce significant reductions in post-fit position errors. Simple models for estimating these systematic biases are shown to be effective without introducing the need for high-complexity Machine Learning (ML) models. Furthermore, by establishing a TLE-based error metric, the need for high accuracy ephemerides is removed when creating these models. For selected satellites in the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) regime, post-fit position errors are reduced by up to 80 %, from approximately 5 km to 1 km; meanwhile, for selected satellites in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)/Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GSO) regime, large oscillations in post-fit position error can be suppressed.</description>

      <title>Robustness-enhanced Myoelectric Control with GAN-based Open-set Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used in human motion recognition and medical rehabilitation, yet their variability and susceptibility to noise significantly limit the reliability of myoelectric control systems. Existing recognition algorithms often fail to handle unfamiliar actions effectively, leading to system instability and errors. This paper proposes a novel framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the robustness and usability of myoelectric control systems by enabling open-set recognition. The method incorporates a GAN-based discriminator to identify and reject unknown actions, maintaining system stability by preventing misclassifications. Experimental evaluations on publicly available and self-collected datasets demonstrate a recognition accuracy of 97.6\% for known actions and a 23.6\% improvement in Active Error Rate (AER) after rejecting unknown actions. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and suitable for deployment on edge devices, making it practical for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Dual-Polarized Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a family of RIS architectures more flexible than conventional RIS. While BD-RIS has been primarily analyzed assuming uni-polarized systems, modern wireless deployments are dual-polarized. To address this gap, this paper investigates the fundamental limits of dual-polarized BD-RIS-aided systems. We derive the scaling laws governing the performance of BD-RIS and the Pareto frontier of the trade-off between performance and circuit complexity enabled by BD-RIS. Theoretical results show that the group-connected RIS with group size 2 provides remarkable gains over conventional RIS in both Rayleigh and line-of-sight (LoS) channels, while maintaining a reduced circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>Camera-Based Localization and Enhanced Normalized Mutual Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust and fine localization algorithms are crucial for autonomous driving. For the production of such vehicles as a commodity, affordable sensing solutions and reliable localization algorithms must be designed. This work considers scenarios where the sensor data comes from images captured by an inexpensive camera mounted on the vehicle and where the vehicle contains a fine global map. Such localization algorithms typically involve finding the section in the global map that best matches the captured image. In harsh environments, both the global map and the captured image can be noisy. Because of physical constraints on camera placement, the image captured by the camera can be viewed as a noisy perspective transformed version of the road in the global map. Thus, an optimal algorithm should take into account the unequal noise power in various regions of the captured image, and the intrinsic uncertainty in the global map due to environmental variations. This article briefly reviews two matching methods: (i) standard inner product (SIP) and (ii) normalized mutual information (NMI). It then proposes novel and principled modifications to improve the performance of these algorithms significantly in noisy environments. These enhancements are inspired by the physical constraints associated with autonomous vehicles. They are grounded in statistical signal processing and, in some context, are provably better. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of such modifications.</description>

      <title>Optical RISs Improve the Secret Key Rate of Free-Space QKD in HAP-to-UAV Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) are proposed for employment on building rooftops to facilitate free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) between highaltitude platforms (HAPs) and low-altitude platforms (LAPs). Due to practical constraints, the communication terminals can only be positioned beneath the LAPs, preventing direct upward links to HAPs. By deploying ORISs on rooftops to reflect the beam arriving from HAPs towards LAPs from below, reliable HAP-to-LAP links can be established. To accurately characterize the optical beam propagation, we develop an analytical channel model based on extended Huygens-Fresnel principles for representing both the atmospheric turbulence effects and the hovering fluctuations of LAPs. This model facilitates adaptive ORIS beam-width control through linear, quadratic, and focusing phase shifts, which are capable of effectively mitigating the detrimental effects of beam broadening and pointing errors (PE). Consequently, the information-theoretic bound of the secret key rate and the security performance of a decoy-state QKD protocol are analyzed. Our findings demonstrate that quadratic phase shifts enhance the SKR at high HAP-ORIS zenith angles or mild PE conditions by narrowing the beam to optimal sizes. By contrast, linear phase shifts are advantageous at low HAP-ORIS zenith angles or moderate-to-high PE by diverging the beam to mitigate LAP fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: This letter investigates a movable antenna (MA)-aided full-duplex (FD) satellite communication system, where the satellite, equipped with both transmit and receive MAs, serves multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) user terminals (UTs) in FD mode. Specifically, we formulate a multiobjective optimization problem to minimize the UL and DL transmit powers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To jointly optimize the MA positions and transmit powers, we propose a two-loop particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on a multiobjective optimization framework. Simulation results show that flexible adjustments of MA positions can effectively reduce the total UL and DL transmit powers, while also alleviating the burden on self-interference (SI) cancellation modules.</description>

Abstract: A multimode multiport antenna (M$^3$PA), constisting of a single conducting structure, is proposed for use with the airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS). Its cupola-shaped surface is selected from a set of aerodynamically suitable and symmetric structures. The selection is based on a presented statistical evaluation procedure for direction-finding (DF) antennas and algorithms, which predicts the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimation using characteristic modes (CMs). A demonstrator antenna and feed network is manufactured and its three ports are measured in an anechoic chamber. The results match the intended far-fields of an electric monopole and two magnetic dipoles. The presented flight test results show that the antenna is capable of unambiguous DF across the desired angular range in a real world environment.</description>

      <title>Modified Baum-Welch Algorithm for Joint Blind Channel Estimation and Turbo Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blind estimation of intersymbol interference channels based on the Baum-Welch (BW) algorithm, a specific implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for training hidden Markov models, is robust and does not require labeled data. However, it is known for its extensive computation cost, slow convergence, and frequently converges to a local maximum. In this paper, we modified the trellis structure of the BW algorithm by associating the channel parameters with two consecutive states. This modification enables us to reduce the number of required states by half while maintaining the same performance. Moreover, to improve the convergence rate and the estimation performance, we construct a joint turbo-BW-equalization system by exploiting the extrinsic information produced by the turbo decoder to refine the BW-based estimator at each EM iteration. Our experiments demonstrate that the joint system achieves convergence in 10 EM iterations, which is 8 iterations less than a separate system design for a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 4dB. Additionally, the joint system provides improved estimation accuracy with a mean square error (MSE) of $10^{-4}$ for an SNR of 6dB. We also identify scenarios where a joint design is not preferable, especially when the channel is noisy (e.g., SNR=2dB) and the decoder cannot provide reliable extrinsic information for a BW-based estimator.</description>

      <title>EOM Minimum Point Bias Voltage Estimation for Application in Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum computing systems the quantum states of qubits can be modified among others by applying light pulses. In order to achieve low computing error rates these pulses have to be precisely shaped in magnitude and phase. In practical applications, both acousto-optic (AOM) and electro-optic modulators (EOM) are used for this purpose. The advantages of EOMs, in particular Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs), include e.g. higher bandwidth, compactness, good integrability and better noise performance. On the other hand, EOMs are challenging regarding their control voltage regulation as they experience a bias drift, i.e. voltage shifts in the modulator's operating point. Such a shift significantly impairs the quality of the modulation, which is why EOMs usually require a bias control loop to track the DC operating point. This work addresses the estimation of the instantaneous bias voltage using a small pilot tone, where the optical output power of the EOM is tracked by a photodetector feedback signal.</description>

      <title>PAPR Reduction with Pre-chirp Selection for Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14064v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising new multicarrier technique for high-mobility communications based on discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). By properly tuning two parameters in the DAFT module, the effective channel in the DAFT domain can completely circumvent path overlap, thereby constituting a full representation of delay-Doppler profile. However, AFDM has a crucial problem of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), stemming from randomness of modulated symbols. To reduce the PAPR of AFDM, a novel algorithm named grouped pre-chirp selection (GPS) is proposed in this letter. The GPS varying the pre-chirp parameter across subcarrier groups in a non-enumerated manner and then selects the signal with the smallest PAPR among all candidate signals. We detail the operational procedures of the GPS algorithm, analyzing GPS from four aspects: PAPR performance, computational complexity, spectral efficiency, and bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulations indicate the effectiveness of the proposed GPS in reducing PAPR. At the cost of slight communication performance, AFDM with GPS can achieve better PAPR performance than orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) while maintaining a lower modulation complexity.</description>

Abstract: The cortico-spinal neural pathway is fundamental for motor control and movement execution, and in humans it is typically studied using concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings. However, current approaches for capturing high-level and contextual connectivity between these recordings have important limitations. Here, we present a novel application of statistical dependence estimators based on orthonormal decomposition of density ratios to model the relationship between cortical and muscle oscillations. Our method extends from traditional scalar-valued measures by learning eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and projection spaces of density ratios from realizations of the signal, addressing the interpretability, scalability, and local temporal dependence of cortico-muscular connectivity. We experimentally demonstrate that eigenfunctions learned from cortico-muscular connectivity can accurately classify movements and subjects. Moreover, they reveal channel and temporal dependencies that confirm the activation of specific EEG channels during movement.
