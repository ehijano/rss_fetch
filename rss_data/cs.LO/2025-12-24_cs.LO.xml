      <title>The Limitations and Power of NP-Oracle-Based Functional Synthesis Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Boolean relational specification between inputs and outputs, the problem of functional synthesis is to construct a function that maps each assignment of the input to an assignment of the output such that each tuple of input and output assignments meets the specification. The past decade has witnessed significant improvement in the scalability of functional synthesis tools, allowing them to handle problems with tens of thousands of variables. A common ingredient in these approaches is their reliance on SAT solvers, thereby exploiting the breakthrough advances in SAT solving over the past three decades. While the recent techniques have been shown to perform well in practice, there is little theoretical understanding of the limitations and power of these approaches.
  The primary contribution of this work is to initiate a systematic theoretical investigation into the power of functional synthesis approaches that rely on NP oracles. We first show that even when small Skolem functions exist, naive bit-by-bit learning approaches fail due to the relational nature of specifications. We establish fundamental limitations of interpolation-based approaches, proving that even when small Skolem functions exist, resolution-based interpolation must produce exponential-size circuits. We prove that access to an NP oracle is inherently necessary for efficient synthesis. Our main technical result shows that it is possible to use NP oracles to synthesize small Skolem functions in time polynomial in the size of the specification and the size of the smallest sufficient set of witnesses, establishing positive results for a broad class of relational specifications.</description>

      <title>All-optical 3-input OR and 2-input AND/NIMPLY logic gates in a linear planar three-core optical fiber coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most all-optical logic processing devices reported in the literature rely on nonlinear effects, which increase implementation complexity and hinder scalability in larger optical circuits. In this work, we present the numerical modeling of two all-optical logic gates based on a fully linear, dispersion-free planar symmetric three-core optical fiber coupler. The devices operate with low-power amplitude-modulated pulses and require no nonlinear materials or mechanisms. By exploiting only the fiber geometry and coupled-mode theory, we demonstrate two logic processing functionalities: a 3-input OR gate and a configurable logic gate that performs either the AND or the NIMPLY operation, selected by a control signal. The proposed devices exhibit clear logical discrimination according to a contrast-based performance metric and feature simple structures that favor compact implementations and integration into larger linear photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>When Natural Strategies Meet Fuzziness and Resource-Bounded Actions (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In formal strategic reasoning for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), agents are typically assumed to (i) employ arbitrarily complex strategies, (ii) execute each move at zero cost, and (iii) operate over fully crisp game structures. These idealized assumptions stand in stark contrast with human decision making in real world environments. The natural strategies framework along with some of its recent variants, partially addresses this gap by restricting strategies to concise rules guarded by regular expressions. Yet, it still overlook both the cost of each action and the uncertainty that often characterizes human perception of facts over the time. In this work, we introduce HumanATLF, a logic that builds upon natural strategies employing both fuzzy semantics and resource bound actions: each action carries a real valued cost drawn from a non refillable budget, and atomic conditions and goals have degrees in [0,1]. We give a formal syntax and semantics, and prove that model checking is in P when both the strategy complexity k and resource budget b are fixed, NP complete if just one strategic operator over Boolean objectives is allowed, and Delta^P_2 complete when k and b vary. Moreover, we show that recall based strategies can be decided in PSPACE. We implement our algorithms in VITAMIN, an open source model checking tool for MAS and validate them on an adversarial resource aware drone rescue scenario.</description>

      <title>Cardinality and Representation of Stone Relation Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11676v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has axiomatised the cardinality operation in relation algebras, which counts the number of edges of an unweighted graph. We generalise the cardinality axioms to Stone relation algebras, which model weighted graphs, and study the relationships between various axioms for cardinality. This results in simpler cardinality axioms also for relation algebras. We give sufficient conditions for the representability of Stone relation algebras and for Stone relation algebras to be relation algebras.</description>

      <title>Effectful Mealy Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effectful Mealy machines, which we introduce, are a generalization of Mealy machines with global effects determined by an effectful triple. We provide semantics of effectful Mealy machines in terms of both bisimilarity and traces: bisimilarity is characterized syntactically, via uniform feedback; traces are constructed coinductively in terms of streams. We prove that this framework characterizes standard causal processes and existing flavours of Mealy machine, bisimilarity, and trace equivalence. In the commutative case, we introduce a monoidal generalization of Raney's causal functions: monoidal causal processes.</description>

      <title>The Seifert-van Kampen Theorem via Computational Paths: A Formalized Approach to Computing Fundamental Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Seifert-van Kampen theorem computes the fundamental group of a space from the fundamental groups of its constituents. We develop a modular SVK framework within the setting of computational paths - an approach to equality where witnesses are explicit sequences of rewrites governed by the LNDEQ-TRS. Our contributions are: (i) pushouts as higher-inductive types with modular typeclass assumptions for computation rules; (ii) free products and amalgamated free products as quotients of word representations; (iii) an SVK equivalence schema parametric in user-supplied encode/decode structure; and (iv) instantiations for classical spaces - figure-eight (pi_1(S^1 v S^1) = Z * Z), 2-sphere (pi_1(S^2) = 1), and 3-sphere (pi_1(S^3) = 1) with Hopf fibration context. Recent extensions include higher homotopy groups pi_n via weak infinity-groupoid structure (with pi_2 abelian via Eckmann-Hilton), and pi_1 &gt;= 1 in the 1-groupoid truncated setting; truncation levels connecting the framework to HoTT; automated path simplification tactics; basic covering space theory with pi_1-actions on fibers; fibration theory with long exact sequences; and Eilenberg-MacLane space characterization (S^1 = K(Z,1)). The development is formalized in Lean 4 with 41,130 lines across 107 modules, using 36 kernel axioms for HIT type-constructor declarations.</description>

      <title>Derivatives for Containers in Univalent Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Containers conveniently represent a wide class of inductive data types. Their derivatives compute representations of types of one-hole contexts, useful for implementing tree-traversal algorithms. In the category of containers and cartesian morphisms, derivatives of discrete containers (whose positions have decidable equality) satisfy a universal property. Working in Univalent Foundations, we extend the derivative operation to untruncated containers (whose shapes and positions are arbitrary types). We prove that this derivative, defined in terms of a set of isolated positions, satisfies an appropriate universal property in the wild category of untruncated containers and cartesian morphisms, as well as basic laws with respect to constants, sums and products. A chain rule exists, but is in general non-invertible. In fact, a globally invertible chain rule is inconsistent in the presence of non-set types, and equivalent to a classical principle when restricted to set-truncated containers. We derive a rule for derivatives of smallest fixed points from the chain rule, and characterize its invertibility. All of our results are formalized in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>The Dual of Quantifier Elimination: Boolean Elimination over C and R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every finite Boolean combination of polynomial equalities and inequalities in C^n admits two uniform normal forms: an $\exists\forall$ form and a $\forall\exists$ form, each using a single polynomial equation. Both forms use only one existentially quantified variable and one universally quantified variable. Optimality results demonstrate that no purely existential or universal normal form is possible over C.
  These results extend to sets constructible from entire functions, and to quantifier-free formulas in functional languages over infinite fields of characteristic 0. A corollary shows Zilber's conjecture on quasiminimality equivalent to its subcase quantifying a single equation.
  Over R and Q, similar results hold, including a singly-quantified $\exists$ form for Boolean combinations of equations and inequations, an $\exists$ form for R established by prior methods, and other results for order inequalities parallel to the forms over C.
  These results provide a dual to classical quantifier elimination: instead of removing quantifiers at the cost of increased Boolean complexity, they remove Boolean structure at the cost of a short, fixed quantifier prefix. The constructions have linear degree bounds and are explicit.</description>
