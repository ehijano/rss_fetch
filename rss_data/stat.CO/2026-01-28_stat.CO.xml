      <title>On randomized step sizes in Metropolis-Hastings algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms is highly sensitive to the choice of step size, and miss-specification can lead to severe loss of efficiency. We study algorithms with randomized step sizes, considering both auxiliary-variable and marginalized constructions. We show that algorithms with a randomized step size inherit weak Poincar\'e inequalities/spectral gaps from their fixed-step-size counterparts under minimal conditions, and that the marginalized kernel should always be preferred in terms of asymptotic variance to the auxiliary-variable choice if it is implementable. In addition we show that both types of randomization make an algorithm robust to tuning, meaning that spectral gaps decay polynomially as the step size is increasingly poorly chosen. We further show that step-size randomization often preserves high-dimensional scaling limits and algorithmic complexity, while increasing the optimal acceptance rate for Langevin and Hamiltonian samplers when an Exponential or Uniform distribution is chosen to randomize the step size. Theoretical results are complemented with a numerical study on challenging benchmarks such as Poisson regression, Neal's funnel and the Rosenbrock (banana) distribution.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-order parallel sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding effective ways to exploit parallel computing to accelerate Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is an important problem in Bayesian computation and related disciplines. In this paper, we consider the zeroth-order setting where the unnormalized target distribution can be evaluated but its gradient is unavailable for theoretical, practical, or computational reasons. We also assume access to $m$ parallel processors to accelerate convergence. The proposed approach is inspired by modern zeroth-order optimization methods, which mimic gradient-based schemes by replacing the gradient with a zeroth-order stochastic gradient estimator. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show that a naive application of popular zeroth-order stochastic gradient estimators within Markov chain Monte Carlo methods leads to algorithms with poor dependence on $m$, both for unadjusted and Metropolis-adjusted schemes. We then propose a simple remedy to this problem, based on a random-slice perspective, as opposed to a stochastic gradient one, obtaining a new class of zeroth-order samplers that provably achieve a polynomial speed-up in $m$. Theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Latent characterisation of the complete BATSE gamma ray bursts catalogue using Gaussian mixture of factor analysers and model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterising and distinguishing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has interested astronomers for many decades. While some authors have found two or three groups of GRBs by analyzing only a few parameters, recent work identified five ellipsoidally-shaped groups upon considering nine parameters $T_{50}, T_{90}, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, P_{64}, P_{256}, P_{1024}$. Yet others suggest sub-classes within the two or three groups found earlier. Using a mixture model of Gaussian factor analysers, we analysed 1150 GRBs, that had nine parameters observed, from the current Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalogue, and again established five ellipsoidal-shaped groups to describe the GRBs. These five groups are characterised in terms of their average duration, fluence and spectrum as shorter-faint-hard, long-intermediate-soft, long-intermediate-intermediate, long-bright-intermediate and short-faint-hard. The use of factor analysers in describing individual group densities allows for a more thorough group-wise characterisation of the parameters in terms of a few latent features. However, given the discrepancy with many other existing studies that advocated for two or three groups, we also performed model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering (MOBSynC) that successively merges poorer-separated groups. The five ellipsoidal groups merge into three and then into two groups, one with GRBs of low durations and the other having longer duration GRBs. These groups are also characterised in terms of a few latent factors made up of the nine parameters. Our analysis provides context for all three sets of results, and in doing so, details a multi-layered characterisation of the BATSE GRBs, while also explaining the structure in their variability.</description>

      <title>LightSBB-M: Bridging Schr\"odinger and Bass for Generative Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/alexouadi/LightSBB-M.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Closed-Form Bandwidth Selector for the Beta Kernel Density Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Beta kernel estimator offers a theoretically superior alternative to the Gaussian kernel for unit interval data, eliminating boundary bias without requiring reflection or transformation. However, its adoption remains limited by the lack of a reliable bandwidth selector; practitioners currently rely on iterative optimization methods that are computationally expensive and prone to instability. We derive the ``\rot,'' a fast, closed-form bandwidth selector based on the unweighted Asymptotic Mean Integrated Squared Error (AMISE) of a beta reference distribution. To address boundary integrability issues, we introduce a principled heuristic for U-shaped and J-shaped distributions. By employing a method-of-moments approximation, we reduce the bandwidth selection complexity from iterative optimization to $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our rule matches the accuracy of numerical optimization while delivering a speedup of over 35,000 times. Real-world validation on socioeconomic data shows that it avoids the ``vanishing boundary'' and ``shoulder'' artifacts common to Gaussian-based methods. We provide a comprehensive, open-source Python package to facilitate the immediate adoption of the Beta kernel as a drop-in replacement for standard density estimation tools.</description>

      <title>Linear-Cost Vecchia Approximation of Multivariate Normal Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09426v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate normal (MVN) probabilities arise in myriad applications, but they are analytically intractable and need to be evaluated via Monte-Carlo-based numerical integration. For the state-of-the-art minimax exponential tilting (MET) method, we show that the complexity of each of its components can be greatly reduced through an integrand parameterization that utilizes the sparse inverse Cholesky factor produced by the Vecchia approximation, whose approximation error is often negligible relative to the Monte-Carlo error. Based on this idea, we derive algorithms that can estimate MVN probabilities and sample from truncated MVN distributions in linear time (and that are easily parallelizable) at the same convergence or acceptance rate as MET, whose complexity is cubic in the dimension of the MVN probability. We showcase the advantages of our methods relative to existing approaches using several simulated examples. We also analyze a groundwater-contamination dataset with over twenty thousand censored measurements to demonstrate the scalability of our method for partially censored Gaussian-process models.</description>

      <title>Beyond the noise: intrinsic dimension estimation with optimal neighbourhood identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Intrinsic Dimension (ID) is a key concept in unsupervised learning and feature selection, as it is a lower bound to the number of variables which are necessary to describe a system. However, in almost any real-world dataset the ID depends on the scale at which the data are analysed. Quite typically at a small scale, the ID is very large, as the data are affected by measurement errors. At large scale, the ID can also be erroneously large, due to the curvature and the topology of the manifold containing the data. In this work, we introduce an automatic protocol to select the sweet spot, namely the correct range of scales in which the ID is meaningful and useful. This protocol is based on imposing that for distances smaller than the correct scale the density of the data is constant. In the presented framework, to estimate the density it is necessary to know the ID, therefore, this condition is imposed self-consistently. We illustrate the usefulness and robustness of this procedure to noise by benchmarks on artificial and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>On the contraction properties of Sinkhorn semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel stability theory for Sinkhorn semigroups based on Lyapunov techniques and quantitative contraction coefficients, and establish exponential convergence of Sinkhorn iterations on weighted Banach spaces. This operator-theoretic framework yields explicit exponential decay rates of Sinkhorn iterates toward Schr\"odinger bridges with respect to a broad class of $\phi$-divergences and Kantorovich-type distances, including relative entropy, squared Hellinger integrals, $\alpha$-divergences, weighted total variation norms, and Wasserstein distances. To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first systematic contraction inequalities of this kind for entropic transport and the Sinkhorn algorithm. We further introduce Lyapunov contraction principles under minimal regularity assumptions, leading to quantitative exponential stability estimates for a large family of Sinkhorn semigroups. The framework applies to models with polynomially growing potentials and heavy-tailed marginals on general normed spaces, as well as to more structured boundary state-space models, including semicircle transitions and Beta, Weibull, and exponential marginals, together with semi-compact settings. Finally, our approach extends naturally to statistical finite mixtures of such models, including kernel-based density estimators arising in modern generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Correction of Erroneous State Estimates via Diffusion Bayesian Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In emergency response and other high-stakes societal applications, early-stage state estimates critically shape downstream outcomes. Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Adaptive Joint Learning Framework for High-Dimensional Time-Varying Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern biomedical and econometric studies, longitudinal processes are often characterized by complex time-varying associations and abrupt regime shifts that are shared across correlated outcomes. Standard functional data analysis (FDA) methods, which prioritize smoothness, often fail to capture these dynamic structural features, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This article introduces Adaptive Joint Learning (AJL), a hierarchical regularization framework designed to integrate functional variable selection with structural changepoint detection in multivariate time-varying coefficient models. Unlike standard simultaneous estimation approaches, we propose a theoretically grounded two-stage screening-and-refinement procedure. This framework first synergizes adaptive group-wise penalization with sure screening principles to robustly identify active predictors, followed by a refined fused regularization step that effectively borrows strength across multiple outcomes to detect local regime shifts. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the estimator in the ultra-high-dimensional regime (p &gt;&gt; n). Crucially, we establish the sure screening consistency of the first stage, which serves as the foundation for proving that the refined estimator achieves the oracle property-performing as well as if the true active set and changepoint locations were known a priori. A key theoretical contribution is the explicit handling of approximation bias via undersmoothing conditions to ensure valid asymptotic inference. The proposed method is validated through comprehensive simulations and an application to Sleep-EDF data, revealing novel dynamic patterns in physiological states.</description>
