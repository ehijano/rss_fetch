      <title>The Green Side of the Lua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights the importance of energy-efficient software to reduce the global carbon footprint. Programming languages and execution models strongly influence software energy consumption, with interpreted languages generally being less efficient than compiled ones. Lua illustrates this trade-off: despite its popularity, it is less energy-efficient than greener and faster languages such as C.
  This paper presents an empirical study of Lua's runtime performance and energy efficiency across 25 official interpreter versions and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter. Moreover, LuaJIT approaches C's efficiency, using roughly six times more energy and running about eight times slower, demonstrating the substantial benefits of JIT compilation for improving both performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages.</description>

      <title>Relational Hoare Logic for High-Level Synthesis of Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is a powerful tool for developing efficient hardware accelerators that rely on specialized memory systems to achieve sufficient on-chip data reuse and off-chip bandwidth utilization. However, even with HLS, designing such systems still requires careful manual tuning, as automatic optimizations provided by existing tools are highly sensitive to programming style and often lack transparency. To address these issues, we present a formal translation framework based on relational Hoare logic, which enables robust and transparent transformations. Our method recognizes complex memory access patterns in na\"ive HLS programs and automatically transforms them by inserting on-chip buffers to enforce linear access to off-chip memory, and by replacing non-sequential processing with stream processing, while preserving program semantics. Experiments using our prototype translator, combined with an off-the-shelf HLS compiler and a real FPGA board, have demonstrated significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Outrunning Big KATs: Efficient Decision Procedures for Variants of GKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents several efficient decision procedures for trace equivalence of GKAT automata, which make use of on-the-fly symbolic techniques via SAT solvers. To demonstrate applicability of our algorithms, we designed symbolic derivatives for CF-GKAT, a practical system based on GKAT designed to validate control-flow transformations. We implemented the algorithms in Rust and evaluated them on both randomly generated benchmarks and real-world control-flow transformations. Indeed, we observed order-of-magnitude performance improvements against existing implementations for both KAT and CF-GKAT. Notably, our experiments also revealed a bug in Ghidra, an industry-standard decompiler, highlighting the practical viability of these systems.</description>
