      <title>Local Flow Estimation at the top of the Earth's Core using Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth's main geomagnetic field arises from the constant motion of the fluid outer core. By assuming that the field changes are advection-dominated, the fluid motion at the core surface can be related to the secular variation of the geomagnetic field. The majority of existing core flow models are global, showing features such as an eccentric planetary gyre, with some evidence of rapid regional changes. By construction, the flow defined at any location by such a model depends on all magnetic field variations across the entire core-mantle boundary making it challenging to interpret local structures in the flow as due to specific local changes in magnetic field. Here we present an alternative strategy in which we construct regional flow models that rely only on local secular changes. We use a novel technique based on machine learning termed Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), in which we seek a regional flow model that simultaneously fits both the local magnetic field variation and dynamical conditions assumed satisfied by the flow. Although we present results using the Tangentially Geostrophic flow constraint, we set out a modelling framework for which the physics constraint can be easily changed by altering a single line of code. After validating the PINN-based method on synthetic flows, we apply our method to the CHAOS-8.1 geomagnetic field model, itself based on data from Swarm. Constructing a global mosaic of regional flows, we reproduce the planetary gyre, providing independent evidence that the strong secular changes at high latitude and in equatorial regions are part of the same global feature. Our models also corroborate regional changes in core flows over the last decade. Furthermore, our models endorse the existence of a dynamic high latitude jet, which began accelerating around 2005 but has been weakening since 2017.</description>

      <title>The Gradient of Mean Molecular Weight Across the Radius Valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photo-evaporation shapes the observed radii of small exoplanets and constrains the underlying distributions of atmospheric and core masses. However, the diversity of atmospheric chemistries corresponding to these distributions remains unelucidated. We develop a first-principles carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-sulfur-silicon (CHOSSi) outgassing model that accounts for non-ideal gas behavior (via fugacities) at high pressures, as well as the tendency for water and hydrogen to dissolve in melt (via solubility laws). We use data-driven radius valley constraints to establish the relationship between the atmospheric surface pressures and melt temperatures of sub-Neptunes. Sub-Neptunes with less massive rocky cores retain less of their primordial hydrogen envelopes, which leads to less heat retention and diminished melt temperatures at the surfaces of these cores. Lower melt temperatures lead thermodynamically to the dominance of carbon-, oxygen-, sulfur- and silicon-bearing molecules over molecular hydrogen, which naturally produce a diversity of mean molecular weights. Our geochemical outgassing calculations robustly predict a gradient of mean molecular weight across the radius valley, where the strength of this gradient is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity of the molten cores and not by the carbon enrichment (or "metallicity") of the atmosphere. Smaller sub-Neptunes are predicted to have less hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The precise relationship between the observed and outgassed chemistries requires an understanding of how convection near the core interacts with large-scale atmospheric circulation (driven by stellar heating) near the photosphere, as well as the influence of photochemistry.</description>
