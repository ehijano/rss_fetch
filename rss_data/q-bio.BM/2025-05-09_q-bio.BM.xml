      <title>Guide your favorite protein sequence generative model</title>

Abstract: Generative machine learning models have begun to transform protein engineering, yet no principled framework for conditioning on auxiliary information in a plug-and-play manner exists; one may want to iteratively incorporate experimental feedback, or make use of an existing classifier -- such as for predicting enzyme commission number -- in order to guide the sampling of the generative model to generate sequences with desired properties. Herein, we present ProteinGuide, a rigorous and general framework to achieve just that: through unifying a broad class of protein generative models that includes masked language, (order-agnostic) autoregressive, diffusion and flow-matching models, we provide an approach to statistically condition pre-trained protein generative models. We demonstrate applicability of our approach by guiding each of two commonly used protein generative models, ProteinMPNN and ESM3, to generate amino acid and structure token sequences conditioned on several user-specified properties, namely, enhanced stability and CATH-labeled fold generation.</description>

      <title>Statistical method for A-RNA and B-DNA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleic acids have been regarded as stiff polymers with long-range flexibility and generally modeled using elastic rod models of polymer physics. Notwithstanding, investigations carried out over the past few years on single fragments of order $\sim 100$ base pairs have revealed remarkable flexibility properties at short scales and called for theoretical approaches that emphasize the role of the bending fluctuations at single sites along the molecule stack. Here, we review a three dimensional mesoscopic Hamiltonian model which assumes a discrete representation of the double stranded (ds) molecules at the level of the nucleotides. The model captures the fundamental local interactions between adjacent sugar-phosphate groups and the pairwise interactions between complementary base pair mates. A statistical method based on the path integral formalism sets the ensemble of the base pair breathing fluctuations which are included in the partition function and permits to derive the thermodynamics and the elastic response of single molecules to external forces. We apply the model to the computation of the twist-stretch relations for fragments of ds-DNA and ds-RNA, showing that the obtained opposite pattern (DNA overtwists whereas RNA untwists versus force) follows from the different structural features of the two helices. Moreover, we focus on the DNA stretching due to the confinement in nano-pores and, finally, on the computation of the cyclization probability of open ends molecules of $\sim 100$ base pairs under physiological conditions. The mesoscopic model shows a distinct advantage over the elastic rod model in estimating the molecule bendability at short length scale.</description>

      <title>Nonsuppressible viremia during HIV-1 therapy meets molecular virology</title>

Abstract: HIV-1 replication can be suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART), but individuals who stop taking ART soon become viremic again. Some people experience extended times of detectable viremia despite optimal adherence to ART. In the issue of the JCI, White, Wu, and coauthors elucidate a source of nonsuppressible viremia (NSV) in treatment-adherent patients clonally expanded T cells harboring HIV-1 proviruses with small deletions or mutations in the 5'-leader, the UTR that includes the major splice donor site of viral RNA. These mutations altered viral RNA-splicing efficiency and RNA dimerization and packaging, yet still allowed production of detectable levels of noninfectious virus particles. These particles lacked the HIV-1 Env surface protein required for cell entry and failed to form the mature capsid cone required for infectivity. These studies improve our understanding of NSV and the regulation of viral functions in the 5'-leader with implications for rationalized care in individuals with NSV.</description>

      <title>Advances in Protein Representation Learning: Methods, Applications, and Future Directions</title>

Abstract: Proteins are complex biomolecules that play a central role in various biological processes, making them critical targets for breakthroughs in molecular biology, medical research, and drug discovery. Deciphering their intricate, hierarchical structures, and diverse functions is essential for advancing our understanding of life at the molecular level. Protein Representation Learning (PRL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling the extraction of meaningful computational representations from protein data to address these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of PRL research, categorizing methodologies into five key areas: feature-based, sequence-based, structure-based, multimodal, and complex-based approaches. To support researchers in this rapidly evolving field, we introduce widely used databases for protein sequences, structures, and functions, which serve as essential resources for model development and evaluation. We also explore the diverse applications of these approaches in multiple domains, demonstrating their broad impact. Finally, we discuss pressing technical challenges and outline future directions to advance PRL, offering insights to inspire continued innovation in this foundational field.</description>
