      <title>Unconventional Thermalization of a Localized Chain Interacting with an Ergodic Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of many-body localized (MBL) phases intrinsically links spectral properties with eigenstate characteristics: localized systems exhibit Poisson level statistics and area-law entanglement entropy, while ergodic systems display volume-law entanglement and follow random matrix theory predictions, including level repulsion. Here, we introduce the interacting Anderson Quantum Sun model, which significantly deviates from these conventional expectations. In addition to standard localized and ergodic phases, we identify a regime that exhibits volume-law entanglement coexisting with intermediate spectral statistics. We also identify another nonstandard regime marked by Poisson level statistics, sub-volume entanglement growth, and rare-event-dominated correlations, indicative of emerging ergodic instabilities. These results highlight unconventional routes of ergodicity breaking and offer fresh perspectives on how Anderson localization may be destabilized.</description>

      <title>A note on the dynamics of extended-context disordered kinetic spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by striking advances in language modeling, there has recently been much interest in developing autogressive sequence models that are amenable to analytical study. In this short note, we consider extensions of simple disordered kinetic glass models from statistical physics. These models have tunable correlations, are easy to sample, and can be solved exactly when the state space dimension is large. In particular, we give an expository derivation of the dynamical mean field theories that describe their asymptotic statistics. We therefore propose that they constitute an interesting set of toy models for autoregressive sequence generation, in which one might study learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exact results on the hydrodynamics of certain kinetically-constrained hopping processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of interacting random walkers on a triangular chain and triangular lattice, where a particle can move only if the other two sites of the triangle are unoccupied -- a kinetically-constrained hopping process (KCHP) recently introduced in the context of non-linear diffusion cascades. Using a classical-to-quantum mapping -- where the rate matrix of the stochastic KCHP corresponds to a spin Hamiltonian, and the equilibrium probability distribution to the quantum ground state -- we develop a systematic perturbation theory to calculate the diffusion constant; the hydrodynamics of the KCHPs is determined by the low-energy properties of the spin Hamiltonian, which we analyse with the standard Holstein-Primakoff spin-wave expansion.
  For the triangular hopping we consider, we show that \textit{non-interacting} spin-wave theory predicts the \textit{exact} diffusion constant. We conjecture this holds for all KCHPs with (i) hard-core occupancy, (ii) parity-symmetry, and (iii) where the hopping processes are given by three-site gates -- that is, where hopping between two sites is conditioned on the occupancy of a third. We further show that there are corrections to the diffusion constant when the KCHP is described by \textit{four}-site gates, which we calculate at leading order in the semi-classical $1/S$ expansion. We support all these conclusions with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Dis-GEN: Disordered crystal structure generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of synthesized crystalline inorganic materials exhibit compositional disorder, where multiple atomic species partially occupy the same crystallographic site. As a result, the physical and chemical properties of such materials are dependent on how the atomic species are distributed among the corresponding symmetrical sites, making them exceptionally challenging to model using computational methods. For this reason, existing generative models cannot handle the complexities of disordered inorganic crystals. To address this gap, we introduce Dis-GEN, a generative model based on an empirical equivariant representation, derived from theoretical crystallography methodology. Dis-GEN is capable of generating symmetry-consistent structures that accommodate both compositional disorder and vacancies. The model is uniquely trained on experimental structures from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) - the world's largest database of identified inorganic crystal structures. We demonstrate that Dis-GEN can effectively generate disordered inorganic materials while preserving crystallographic symmetry throughout the generation process. This approach provides a critical check point for the systematic exploration and discovery of disordered functional materials, expanding the scope of generative modeling in materials science.</description>

      <title>Local Hall Conductivity in Disordered Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the expression for the local Hall conductivity for systems that lack translation symmetry and use it to study the local fluctuations of the Hall signal around disordered patches in magnetic insulators. We find that the regime in parameter space over which the system is a Chern insulating state increases upon inclusion of non-magnetic potential disorder. In addition, the phase space over which the topological Anderson insulator exists can be enhanced by breaking up a single disordered patch into multiple smaller patches with the same total amount of disorder. We expect our results will motivate the next generation of local scanning and local impedance spectroscopy experiments to visualize Hall currents around patches in the bulk of a disordered topological insulator.</description>

      <title>Sampling the space of solutions of an artificial neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weight space of an artificial neural network can be systematically explored using tools from statistical mechanics. We employ a combination of a hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm which performs long exploration steps, a ratchet-based algorithm to investigate connectivity paths, and coupled replica models simulations to study subdominant flat regions. Our analysis focuses on one hidden layer networks and spans a range of energy levels and constrained density regimes. Near the interpolation threshold, the low-energy manifold shows a spiky topology. In the overparameterized regime, however, the low-energy manifold becomes entirely flat, forming an extended complex structure that is easy to sample. These numerical results are supported by an analytical study of the training error landscape, and we show numerically that the qualitative features of the loss landscape are robust across different data structures.
  Our study aims to provide new methodological insights for developing scalable methods for large networks.</description>

      <title>How to Train an Oscillator Ising Machine using Equilibrium Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) are prime candidates for use as neuromorphic machine learning processors with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) based on-chip learning. The inherent energy gradient descent dynamics of OIMs, combined with their standard CMOS implementation using existing fabrication processes, provide a natural substrate for EP learning. Our simulations confirm that OIMs satisfy the gradient-descending update property necessary for a scalable Equilibrium Propagation implementation and achieve $\sim 97.2\pm0.1\%$ test accuracy on MNIST and $\sim 88.0\pm0.1\%$ on Fashion-MNIST without requiring any significant hardware modifications. Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including 10-bit parameter quantization, 4-bit phase measurement precision, and moderate phase noise that can potentially be beneficial with parameter optimization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Time-Dependent Hessian in High-Dimensional Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent is commonly used to find minima in rough landscapes, particularly in recent machine learning applications. However, a theoretical understanding of why good solutions are found remains elusive, especially in strongly non-convex and high-dimensional settings. Here, we focus on the phase retrieval problem as a typical example, which has received a lot of attention recently in theoretical machine learning. We analyze the Hessian during gradient descent, identify a dynamical transition in its spectral properties, and relate it to the ability of escaping rough regions in the loss landscape. When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large enough, an informative negative direction exists in the Hessian at the beginning of the descent, i.e in the initial condition. While descending, a BBP transition in the spectrum takes place in finite time: the direction is lost, and the dynamics is trapped in a rugged region filled with marginally stable bad minima. Surprisingly, for finite system sizes, this window of negative curvature allows the system to recover the signal well before the theoretical SNR found for infinite sizes, emphasizing the central role of initialization and early-time dynamics for efficiently navigating rough landscapes.</description>

      <title>Role of Nonstabilizerness in Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimization has emerged as a promising approach for tackling complicated classical optimization problems using quantum devices. However, the extent to which such algorithms harness genuine quantum resources and the role of these resources in their success remain open questions. In this work, we investigate the resource requirements of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) through the lens of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that the nonstabilizerness in QAOA increases with circuit depth before it reaches a maximum, to fall again during the approach to the final solution state -- creating a barrier that limits the algorithm's capability for shallow circuits. We find curves corresponding to different depths to collapse under a simple rescaling, and we reveal a nontrivial relationship between the final nonstabilizerness and the success probability. Finally, we identify a similar nonstabilizerness barrier also in adiabatic quantum annealing. Our results provide deeper insights into how quantum resources influence quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Hysteresis Experiments Performed on Quantum Annealers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum annealers have emerged as versatile and controllable platforms for experimenting on correlated spin systems, the important phenomenology of magnetic memory and hysteresis remain unexplored on hardware designed to escape metastable states via quantum tunneling. Here, we present the first general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis on programmable quantum annealers, and implement it on three D-Wave superconducting qubit quantum annealers, using up to thousands of spins, for both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models, and across different graph topologies. We observe hysteresis loops whose area depends non-monotonically on quantum fluctuations, exhibiting both expected and unexpected features, such as disorder-induced steps and non-monotonicities. Our work establishes quantum annealers as a platform for probing non-equilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena, thereby broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>
