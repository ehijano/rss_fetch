      <title>Influence of Fermionic Dark Matter on the Structural and Tidal Properties of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusion of dark matter (DM) in the modeling of neutron stars (NSs) provides important information about the properties of DM and the nature of dense matter. Using some normal matter realistic equation of states (EOSs)with ideal Fermi gas DM EOS in a two-fluid framework, we systematically investigate the observable properties of dark matter-admixed neutron stars with an arbitrary dark matter mass fraction (f) and dark matter particle mass ($\mu$). It has been observed that the deviations of these observable properties from pure normal matter behavior depend significantly on the amount of f,$\mu$ value, and stiffness of normal matter EOS. Furthermore, it has been noted that the properties of dark matter admixed neutron stars are weakly constrained with recent observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Green function of the P\"{o}schl-Teller potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use an approximation of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli potential, known as P\"{o}schl-Teller, to exactly compute the time-domain Green function of black hole perturbations in this simplified model, taking into account all causality conditions. We find the existence of an additional early times piece in the Green function, contributing to new exponentially growing modes just before the signal interacts with the maximum of the potential. The waveform itself is decomposed as an instantaneous piece traveling exactly on the light-cones of the Green function and a historical piece depending on the past trajectory of the system inside the light-cone. We also study redshift modes and show that the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli Green function is regular at their frequency, with no zero nor pole.</description>

      <title>Amplification of new physics in the quasinormal mode spectrum of highly-rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that perturbatively-small higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action can lead to order-one modifications of the quasinormal mode spectrum of near-extremal Kerr black holes. The spectrum of such black holes contains zero-damping modes (ZDMs) and damped modes (DMs), with the latter only existing when the ratio $\mu=m/(l+1/2)$ is below a critical value $\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}\approx 0.744$. Thus, this value represents a "phase boundary" that separates a region with both ZDMs and DMs and a region with only ZDMs. We find that the modes lying close to the phase boundary are very sensitive to modifications of GR, as their lifetimes receive corrections inversely proportional to their distance to the boundary. We link this growth of the corrections to a modification of the critical point $\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}$, which can lead to a change in the number of DMs and produce order-one effects in the spectrum. We show that these large effects can take place in a regime in which the higher-derivative expansion remains under control. We also perform an exact analysis of the modification of the phase boundary for lower $(l,m)$ modes and pinpoint those that are most sensitive to corrections. Our results indicate that spectroscopy of highly-rotating black holes is by far the most powerful way to search for new physics in ringdown signals.</description>

      <title>Gravity with higher-curvature terms and second-order field equations: $f(\mathcal{R})$ meets Gauss-Bonnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity is expected to break down in the high-curvature regime. Beyond an effective field theory treatment with higher-order operators, it is important to identify consistent theories with higher-curvature terms at the nonperturbative level. Two well-studied examples are $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. The former shares the same vacuum solutions as General Relativity, including black holes, while the latter suffers from well-posedness issues due to quadratic curvature terms in the strong-coupling regime. We show that combining these two theories leads to genuinely new phenomena beyond their simple superposition. The resulting framework falls outside Horndeski's class, as it can be recast as a gravitational theory involving two nonminimally coupled scalar fields with nontrivial mutual interactions. This construction naturally extends EdGB gravity to include arbitrary higher-curvature terms, providing a versatile setting to address fundamental questions. Focusing on quadratic and quartic corrections, we find that: (i) black holes are modified by $f(\mathcal{R})$ terms, unlike the case without Gauss-Bonnet interactions; (ii) the resulting solutions retain the qualitative nonperturbative features of EdGB black holes with certain couplings, such as a minimum mass and multiple branches; (iii) a nontrivial mechanism suppresses the divergence of the Ricci scalar in the black-hole interior; (iv) still, even with quartic corrections, the singularity structure and elliptic regions inside the horizon remain similar to those of pure EdGB gravity. This suggests that, at the nonperturbative level, the theory's ill-posedness cannot be resolved by adding individual higher-order terms. This conjecture could be tested by studying the nonlinear dynamics, which remains governed by second-order field equations.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields around black hole binaries in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Constraining a de Broglie-Bohm quantum bounce cosmology with Planck data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the non-standard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce, $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anti-correlation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical and dynamical stability of Einstein-Maxwell and extremal Einstein-Born-Infeld thin shells in $(2\ \mathbf{+}\ 1)$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical and thermodynamical stability of thin shells in (2+1)-dimensional spacetimes composed of an inner anti-de Sitter (AdS) region and an outer region described by a charged Ba\~nados--Teitelboim--Zanelli (BTZ) spacetime, sourced either by Einstein--Maxwell theory (Maxwell-BTZ) or Einstein--Born--Infeld theory (BI-BTZ). Assuming a fixed charge-to-mass ratio and modeling the shell's matter with a linear equation of state, we introduce a convenient parametrization to analyze the dynamical stability configurations. We find that Maxwell-BTZ thin shells admit a wider range of dynamically stable configurations compared to BI-BTZ thin shells. We also derive the thermodynamics of the shell matter, obtaining physically meaningful entropy functions in both cases, and examine the conditions for thermodynamical stability. In the Maxwell-BTZ case, we identify regions in the parameter space where configurations are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable. In contrast, for extremal BI-BTZ thin shells, all thermodynamically stable configurations are contained within the dynamically stable ones, and shells with a linear equation of state are always dynamically stable. This work extends the understanding of thin shell configurations in lower-dimensional gravity and elucidates the interplay between dynamics, thermodynamics, and nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the local and quasilocal properties of the loosely trapped surface (LTS) and the attractive gravity probe surface (AGPS), which have been proposed to characterize the strength of gravity in both strong and weak gravity regions using the mean curvature. In terms of local mass defined in a region surrounded by the two AGPSs and of Geroch quasilocal mass, we present several inequalities concerning their size and area, which are of particular interest. We also propose the improved concepts of the LTS/AGPS, which we call LTS Plus (LTS+) and AGPS Plus (AGPS$+$), defined in terms of expansions of outgoing and ingoing null geodesic congruences on those surfaces. Then, the similar inequalities are proven in terms of appropriately defined local mass and the Hawking quasilocal mass.</description>

      <title>Quantum improved wormholes in the Dekel-Zhao dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents and investigates novel traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of Asymptotically Safe Gravity (ASG), sourced by a dark matter halo modeled by the Dekel--Zhao density profile. The scale-dependent gravitational coupling $G(k)$, derived from the ASG renormalization group flow in the infrared regime, is incorporated directly into the field equations, providing a consistent description of quantum gravitational corrections even at astrophysical scales. The combined effects of the running coupling (parameterized by $\xi$) and the dark matter characteristics determine the geometric structure and physical viability of the wormhole. The solutions satisfy the flare-out and asymptotic flatness conditions within restricted parameter domains, exhibiting enhanced curvature near the throat due to ASG corrections. Null Energy Conditions are necessarily violated at the throat, and stability analysis based on the adiabatic sound speed as well as the modified Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equation reveal that quantum effects from ASG counteract the destabilizing influence of dark matter. Phenomenologically, the wormhole shadow radius increases nearly linearly with $\xi$, lying within the Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A$^*$ when $\xi/M \simeq 0.8--0.9$, thus suggesting that ASG-corrected wormholes may represent observable signatures of quantum gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Bondi Mass for 2D Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Hamiltonian for general semi-classical 2D dilaton gravity, beginning with the com- plete action including the Polyakov action and Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. The value of the Hamiltonian yields a generalized Brown-York quasi-local mass function, and the ADM and Bondi masses are obtained in the appropriate limits. The Bondi mass is equal to the classical mass plus a correction term given by the transformation between initial and final inertial frames. It is non-increasing and remains positive in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous scalarization of regular Hayward black holes in Einstein-nonlinear electromagnetic-scalar gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the spontaneous scalarization of Hayward black holes in Einstein-nonlinear electromagnetic-scalar gravity. Taking into account the tachyonic instability, we obtain scalarized charged black holes (SCBHs) with quadratic (1-$\alpha\varphi^2$) and exponential ($e^{-\alpha \varphi^2}$) couplings, respectively. Moreover, these SCBHs can be labelled by the number of $n = 0, 1, 2,...$, where $n = 0$ is called the fundamental black hole and $n = 1, 2,...$ denote the $n$-excited black holes. We recover that the $n = 0$ branch for both couplings is stable against radial perturbations. This stability shows that this branch can be used for further observational implications.</description>

      <title>Causality as a guiding principle for physics beyond General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis is situated within the context of quantum gravity, broadly understood as any effort to explore the interplay between gravitation and the quantum realm, without necessarily requiring the quantization of the gravitational field itself. We focus on emergent theories, particularly those in which the causal structure and geometric concepts underlying the gravitational field in General Relativity are not fundamental but instead arise from more basic underlying degrees of freedom. Our attention is directed toward emergent approaches inspired by condensed matter physics. Rather than developing a full-fledged emergent theory and analyzing its detailed consequences, this work offers a concise roadmap of analyses and reflections relevant to emergent frameworks, without committing to any specific model. The thesis is divided into two parts, reflecting the distinct tools and analyses employed in each. The first addresses fundamental and conceptual aspects of emergent theories, focusing on the role of background structures, both regarding their implications for the theory and their constructive relevance. The second assumes the absence of singularities and horizons, a feature often expected in emergent frameworks, though the analyses remain agnostic and independent of specific theoretical commitments.</description>

      <title>Raising galaxy rotation curves via dressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant simple model of galaxy dynamics obtained by applying the Dressing Field Method (DFM) to a general-relativistic system comprising the metric and four scalar fields, phenomenologically representing the four-velocity of a cosmological fluid or dust field. The DFM, a systematic tool for extracting the gauge-invariant content in general-relativistic theories, provides a physical coordinatization that yields corrective terms to the rotational velocity profile. These corrections produce galaxy rotation curves that combine a Keplerian and a constant velocity terms, effectively emulating a Dark Matter contribution. We compare DFM-derived rotation curves to observed data for spiral galaxies, from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database, showing that the DFM allows to fit them well.</description>

      <title>Observational Tests of Regular Black Holes with Scalar Hair and their Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geodesic structure and observable properties of asymptotically flat regular black holes sourced by a phantom scalar field characterized by a scalar charge $A$. This parameter removes the central singularity and continuously deforms the Schwarzschild geometry. The equations of motion for test particles and photons are derived, and the resulting null geodesics are analyzed, including the deflection of light, gravitational time delay, and redshift, in order to constrain $A$ using classical Solar System tests. These observations impose stringent limits on the scalar charge, confirming that $A$ must remain extremely small in the weak-field regime to ensure full consistency with general relativity. In the strong-field regime, we compute the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ associated with the photon sphere and establish its exact relations with the critical impact parameter $\mathcal{B}_u$ and the angular size of the shadow $\alpha_{\mathrm{sh}}$, given by $\mathcal{B}_u = 1/|\lambda|$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{sh}} = 1/(r_{0}|\lambda|)$. These correspondences reveal that the dynamical instability of null circular orbits governs the optical appearance of the black hole. Our results show that increasing $A$ reduces the instability of photon trajectories and enlarges the angular size of the shadow, indicating that the regularization scale leaves a distinct observational imprint on the geometry of regular black holes. In addition, constraints derived from Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87* and Sgr A* further restrict the allowed range of the scalar charge, reinforcing the consistency of the model with current astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive analysis of dissipative effects in the induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipation is an intrinsic property of the cosmic fluid, leading to the damping of curvature perturbations at small scales. In this paper, we comprehensively study dissipative effects in gravitational waves induced by curvature perturbations, known as induced gravitational waves (IGWs). We find dissipative effects become especially significant at wavenumber $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$, where $k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ corresponds to the horizon scale at the decoupling of weakly-interacting particles. They can leave characteristic features on the IGW spectrum, including a notable suppression with a ``double-valley'' structure at $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ and a modified infrared behavior without logarithmic running at $k \lesssim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, dissipative effects caused by neutrinos at the nanohertz frequencies can be important in the analysis of pulsar timing array data. Furthermore, dissipation-induced features associated with possible new weakly-interacting particles can be detectable by a wide range of gravitational-wave experiments, serving as a promising probe of new physics at extremely high energy scales. As an extension, we also discuss dissipative effects in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity and their impacts on the anisotropies of IGWs and the poltergeist mechanism. These dissipative effects not only provide a more realistic description of IGWs but also exhibit rich phenomenology and profound physical implications, opening a new window into understanding the early Universe and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Decay of uniformly rotating particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the interpretation of the circular Unruh effect. To this aim, we rely on the principle of general covariance applied to the decay properties of non-inertial particles. Specifically, we show how the tree-level decay rate of an inverse-$\beta$ process involving scalar fields does not require the introduction of a thermal (or non-thermal) bath in the comoving frame to be a scalar under general coordinate transformations. Instead, we interpret any decay process as an emission of negative-energy quanta, whose existence is motivated by the absence of a global vacuum state for uniformly rotating observers. This implies that, in principle, no uniformly rotating particle can be regarded as stable.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Black hole Candidates: A Detailed Analysis of McVittie, Culetu, Sultana-Dyer, and Glass-Mashhoon Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of cosmological black holes by analyzing the properties of trapping horizons in detail, based on Hayward's formalism of future outer and past inner trapping horizons, in several dynamical spacetimes embedded in an expanding universe. Through a detailed examination of the McVittie, Culetu, and Sultana--Dyer metrics, as well as the generalized Glass--Mashhoon solution, we evaluate the existence and characteristics of trapping horizons and energy conditions. The Glass--Mashhoon solution provides an analytical model for spherical stellar collapse. However, it is shown that, as long as certain conditions are satisfied, it lacks suitable future outer trapping horizons, meaning it does not represent a cosmological black hole. As a result, the McVittie class of solutions also fails to describe a cosmological black hole. Conversely, the Culetu and Sultana--Dyer spacetimes can describe a cosmological black hole in the matter-dominated early universe, provided that the relevant energy conditions are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Analysis of observables in FLRW spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a positively curved FLRW spacetime as a background in which a nonrelativistic quantum particle propagates according to the Schroedinger equation. The probability fluid for the corresponding quantum states is taken as a model for the cosmological fluid filling this FLRW Universe. The Hamiltonian operator governing this fictitious particle is proportional to the Laplacian operator derived from the FLRW metric, while the mass of the particle equals the overall matter of the Universe (baryonic and dark). A complete, orthonormal set of quantum eigenstates of the Hamiltonian is obtained. Restricting to radially symmetric states, the latter are then used to compute matrix elements and expectation values of two observables for which quantum operators are identified, namely, the cosmological constant and the gravitational Boltzmann entropy. This entropy is regarded as corresponding to a positively-curved FLRW geometry when the cosmological fluid filling the Universe occupies a given quantum state.</description>

      <title>Loading the stable photon sphere in Weyl conformal gravity metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the accumulation of null matter at the stable photon sphere in the Mannheim-Kazanas metric, the analogue to the Schwarzschild solution in Weyl's conformal theory of gravity. In our toy problem in which we consider an infinitely-thin shell, we find that a jump in radial pressure ${T^r}_r$ is induced across the shell unless the shell has a radius of either the unstable or stable photon sphere radii. We then find that upon loading the stable photon sphere, its area remains invariant. Furthermore, at a critical threshold loading limit for this zero-width null matter shell, we are able to produce a metric containing an extremal horizon with an AdS$_2\times$S$^2$ geometry completely independent of the cosmological curvature. This hitherto unencountered and therefore unexpected result is a phenomenon unseen in standard nonconformal second-order metrics with nonzero cosmological constants.</description>

      <title>Can black holes evaporate past extremality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes with sufficiently large initial charge and mass will Hawking-evaporate towards the extremal limit. The emission slows as the temperature approaches zero, but still reaches the point where a single Hawking quantum would make the object superextremal, removing the horizon. We take this semiclassical prediction at face value and ask: When the emission occurs, what is revealed? Using a model of thin-shell collapse with subsequent accretion/evaporation by a null flux of ingoing positive/negative energy (charged Vaidya spacetime glued to a flat interior), we find two possible outcomes: (i) For shells that are initially very tightly bound, a timelike singularity forms and later appears; or (ii) for unbound or modestly bound shells, the matter re-emerges as a null shell that expands to infinity. This expanding remnant has been bathed in the ingoing Hawking quanta during evaporation and presumably carries correlations with the outgoing quanta, offering the attractive possibility of studying information paradox issues in a setup where spacetime curvatures are globally small, so that quantum gravity is not required. Even for ordinary black holes that evaporate down to the Planck size, we propose a radical new scenario for the interior: rather than forming a singularity, the collapsing matter settles onto an \textit{outgoing} null trajectory \textit{inside} the horizon for the entirety of evaporation.</description>

      <title>Quasi--normal modes of the Ay\'on--Beato--Garc\'ia Black Hole surrounded by quintessence: Scalar field perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasi--normal modes of a massless scalar field in the background of an Ay\'on--Beato--Garc\'ia black hole surrounded by quintessence, using the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) with $30$ iterations. The results show that the real part of the frequencies increases with the charge parameter $g^2$, while the absolute value of the imaginary part decreases as $g^2$ increases. In contrast, both the real part and the absolute value of the imaginary part decrease as the quintessence parameter $c$ increases. These trends are observed for both values of the quintessence state parameter, $\omega_q =-2/3$ and $\omega_q =-4/9$; however, the effects become more pronounced as $\omega_q$ approaches $-1$. The quasi--normal frequencies tend to have finite values, which could facilitate their observational detection. Moreover, the presence of quintessence leads to a slower damping of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>Inconsistencies of Tsallis Cosmology within Horizon Thermodynamics and Holographic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00234v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed frameworks: the Cai-Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedman equations and the Tsallis holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario, considering both the Hubble scale and the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff as infrared regulators. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\delta$, with the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation recovered for $\delta = 1$. While previous studies have suggested that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically requiring $|1 - \delta| \lesssim 10^{-3}$, here we go further and perform a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history.
  We show that even mild departures from $\delta = 1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density can become negative or complex, its equation of state may diverge, or it can contribute an unacceptably large early-time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB constraints. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical interpretation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with the expansion rate toward the past.
  We conclude that within both the Cai-Kim and HDE formulations, a viable cosmology emerges only in the extensive limit, effectively reducing the models to $\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings emphasize the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests, when assessing nonextensive entropy formalisms as potential frameworks for describing the Universe's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Imaging and Polarimetric Signatures of Konoplya-Zhidenko Black Holes with Various Thick Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the imaging properties of spherically symmetric Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) black holes surrounded by geometrically thick accretion flows, adopting a phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model and an analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF) model. General relativistic radiative transfer is employed to compute synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. For the RIAF model, we analyze the dependence of image morphology on the deformation parameter, observing frequency, and flow dynamics. The photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing deformation parameter, with brightness asymmetries arising at high inclinations and depending on flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The BAAF disk produces narrower rings and darker centers, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and vary with viewing angle and deformation, revealing spacetime structure. These results demonstrate that intensity and polarization in thick-disk models provide probes of KZ black holes and near-horizon accretion physics.</description>

      <title>Holographic Systems out of Equilibrium: From Flavor Branes to SYK Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis studies the non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly coupled quantum systems within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, with particular emphasis on periodically driven (Floquet) systems. The first part focuses on top-down holographic constructions based on D3/D5 and D3/D7 brane intersections subjected to time-dependent external fields. In the D3/D5 system at finite temperature, we analyze the response to a rotating electric field and uncover a rich non-equilibrium phase structure containing conductive and insulating phases, vector meson Floquet condensates, and Floquet suppression points. In the D3/D7 setup, we study the effects of helical magnetic fields on chiral symmetry breaking, showing that sufficiently helical magnetc fields can restore chiral symmetry. The second part examines the periodically driven Maldacena-Qi model, a two-site extension of the SYK model dual to a traversable wormhole. We identify resonances that enhance or suppress the wormhole traversability and find evidence that the unstable region of the phase diagram can be dynamically accessed. We use our driving protocols to access this region and compute its Lyapunov exponent. Overall, this thesis advances the use of the holographic techniques to probe non-equilibrium steady states and real-time dynamics in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that non-trivial stringy excitations in Lorentzian three dimensional de Sitter spacetime can be created self-consistently from gravitational memory in the infinite past. In addition to demonstrating that the Nambu-Goto equations for the string emerge from the gravitational junction conditions, we establish the existence of well-behaved solutions corresponding to transient fluctuations of a closed string about the equator which are both borne out of and dissolve to distinct gravitational memory in the infinite past and future, respectively. The solutions of the junction conditions also reveal that a transient string excitation sets up a clock self-consistently without the need of an external observer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of charged, asymptotically de Sitter black holes close to the cold extremal branch of the phase space. We consider black hole sizes that are parametrically smaller than both their inverse temperature and the cosmological horizon. Unlike flat space, charged de Sitter black holes do not evolve towards extremality, but rather towards a thermal equilibrium with the cosmological horizon. In the low-temperature regime, the near-horizon physics can be effectively captured by a one-dimensional Schwarzian theory. This is coupled to the far-horizon de Sitter quantum field theory. Incorporating the thermal nature of the cosmological horizon, we compute the quantum energy transfer through uncharged massless scalar particles. The results significantly differ from Hawking's thermal predictions. Black holes that are hotter than the cosmological horizon emit energy at a rate lower than their asymptotically flat counterparts. Whereas much colder ones absorb energy at a nearly constant rate.</description>

      <title>Covariant field theory of 3D massive fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a covariant and gauge-invariant theory describing massive fractons in three spacetime dimensions, based on a symmetric rank-2 tensor field. The model includes a Chern-Simons-like term that plays a dual role: it generates a topological mass for the tensor gauge field and simultaneously acts as a source of intrinsic fractonic matter. This dual mechanism is novel and leads to a propagating fractonic degree of freedom described by a massive Klein-Gordon equation. The theory propagates two degrees of freedom -- one massive, one massless -- whose number is preserved in the massless limit, in analogy with the Maxwell-Chern-Simons mechanism of Deser-Jackiw-Templeton. We analyze the resulting equations of motion and show that the intrinsic fractonic matter satisfies Gauss- and Amp\`ere-like laws, with conserved dipole and trace of the quadrupole moment. Upon coupling to external matter, a second fractonic sector emerges, leading to a coexistence of intrinsic and extrinsic subsystems with different mobility and conservation properties. Our model provides a unified framework for describing massive fractons with internal structure, and offers a covariant setting for exploring their interactions and extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space mission LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), scheduled for launch in 2035, aims to detect gravitational wave (GW) signals in the milli-Hz band. In the context of ESA Voyage 2050 Call for new mission concepts, other frequency ranges are explored by the Gravitational-Wave Space 2050 Working Group to conceive new proposals for a post-LISA space-based detector. In this work, we give a preliminary estimate of the observational potential of three mission designs proposed in the literature, namely $\mu$Ares, AMIGO and the Decihertz Observatory. The analysis framework includes astrophysical GW sources such as massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals and compact binaries such as stellar black holes and white dwarfs. For each detector, we first present a consistent computation of the unresolved gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the sum of all anticipated astrophysical populations, using an iterative subtraction algorithm. We then investigate which types of systems are the most appealing, by measuring the number of GW signals detected and exploring the source properties.</description>

      <title>Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum quadratic gravity inflationary scenario that can accommodate the new cosmological constraints, which have disfavored Starobinsky inflation. The theory is asymptotically free in the ultraviolet, but 1-loop running is found to dynamically lead to slow-roll inflation toward the infrared. When a large number of matter fields contribute to the beta functions, the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be phenomenologically viable. We find that as inflation ends, the theory approaches its strong coupling regime and general relativity must emerge, as an effective field theory, as the universe must reheat and enter its standard radiation era. In order to avoid strong coupling, a minimum tensor-to-scalar ratio of 0.01 is predicted for this theory. Our framework offers a laboratory for connecting a concrete ultraviolet completion (quantum quadratic gravity) with inflationary dynamics, reheating, and precise cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Matter Power Spectrum from relativistic $N$-body Simulations: $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM versus $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present relativistic $N$-body simulations of a $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM - sign-switching cosmological constant (CC) - scenario under general relativity and compare its nonlinear matter power spectrum to $\Lambda$CDM at ${z = 15,\,2,\,1,\,0}$, using best-fit parameters from Planck-only and a combined ''full'' dataset. During the AdS-like CC ($\Lambda_{\rm s}&lt;0$) phase, prior to the transition redshift $z_\dagger$, reduced Hubble friction dynamically enhances the growth of perturbations; after the switch, with dS-like CC ($\Lambda_{\rm s}&gt;0$), the larger late-time expansion rate partly suppresses, but does not erase, the earlier amplification. Consequently, the ratio $P_{\Lambda_{\rm s}\rm CDM}/P_{\Lambda\rm CDM}$ exhibits a pronounced, redshift-dependent shape feature: a crest peaking at ${\sim 20-25\%}$ around ${k \simeq 1-3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$ near the transition, which then migrates to larger physical scales and persists to ${z = 0}$ as a robust ${\sim 15-20\%}$ uplift at ${k \simeq 0.6-1.0\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$. These wavenumbers correspond to group/poor-cluster environments and lie within the sensitivity range of weak lensing, galaxy-galaxy lensing, cluster counts, and tSZ power, providing a concrete, falsifiable target that cannot be mimicked by a scale-independent change in $\sigma_8$ or $S_8$. The timing (earlier for Planck-only, later for the full dataset) and the amplitude of the crest align with the ''cosmic noon'' epoch (${z \simeq 1-2}$), offering a gravitational prior for the observed peak in the cosmic star-formation rate.</description>

      <title>Beware of the running $n_s$ when producing heavy primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine single-field inflationary models for the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)~\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space of ultra slow roll scenarios (USR). This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of polynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to efficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.</description>

      <title>Reexamining Evidence of a Pair-Instability Mass Gap in the Binary Black Hole Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fourth gravitational wave transient catalog~(GWTC-4) has enabled empirical probes of the theorized pair-instability gap in the higher end of the binary black hole~(BBH) mass-spectrum. In this letter, using flexibly parametrized models, we show that at present there is no evidence of a sharp drop-off in the spectrum of black hole masses near $~40-50M_{\odot}$. We simultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH mass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our flexible models. From the transitions in our inferred spin and mass-ratio distributions, we find that the high-mass broad-spin sub-population has a significant fraction~($52^{+18}_{-23}\%$) of systems with mass ratios in the range $0.6-1$. This suggests that alternatives to the hypothesis of 2G+1G hierarchical systems dominating BBH formation above $\sim 40-50 M_{\odot}$ are more consistent with the GWTC-4 detection sample. By comparing with the predictions of star cluster simulations, we further show that contributions from (2G+2G) systems are not abundant enough to alleviate this discrepancy. We also demonstrate the effects of strong model assumptions on this inference, which can lead to biased astrophysical interpretation from restricted priors. We note that our results do not exclude that a high-mass gap may be identified as our sample size increases. We constrain the lower bound on the location of a possible PISN cutoff still allowed within measurement uncertainties to be $(57^{+17}_{-10}M_{\odot})$ and discuss its implications on the S factor of $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16}O$ at 300 kev.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate superradiance of anyons from a (2+1)-dimensional Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. Our analysis demonstrates that the superradiance condition for anyons mirrors that of a neutral scalar field within a BTZ black hole. Furthermore, we explore the feasibility of observing this phenomenon in analogue black holes and formulate the corresponding superradiance condition for acoustic black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In this work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Bondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the asymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory effects. Although Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese theory has additional nonlinearities not present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects; thus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some subleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and types of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to differences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals that are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries. These differences, however, are of second-order in a small coupling parameter of these theories, which suggests that it would be challenging to use memory effects to distinguish between these two theories. Nevertheless, our results can be used to analyze and interpret memory effects from numerical-relativity simulations of binaries in this theory.</description>

      <title>Standardized Constraints on the Shadow Radius and the Instability of Scalar, Electromagnetic, $p$-Form, and Gravitational Perturbations of High-Dimensional Spherically Symmetric Black Holes in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space-time geometry under investigation is chosen to be a high-dimensional, static, spherically symmetric solution in an asymptotically flat background within the Einstein-power-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet (EPYMGB) gravity. To address the limitations of previous shadow constraints, we construct a standardized framework based on the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric to constrain the characteristic parameters of high-dimensional black holes by leveraging observational shadow data. Additionally, we provide a rigorous derivation of the shadow radius formula for a general high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole. Subsequently, we systematically and comprehensively present the equations of motion and master variables governing spin-0, spin-1, $p$-form, and spin-2 perturbations in high-dimensional static spherically symmetric flat space-time. Our analysis reveals that the Yang-Mills magnetic charge $\mathcal{Q}$ and the power $q$ have a negligible impact on both the shadow radius and perturbations of the black hole when compared to the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant ${\alpha}_2$ in various dimensions. Hence, the physical signatures of the parameters $\mathcal{Q}$ and $q$ in the black hole environment remain undetectable through either perturbation analysis or shadow observations. Cross-validation of the allowable range of ${\alpha}_2$ derived from the high-dimensional constraint on shadow radius and the dynamical stability analysis of gravitational perturbations demonstrates excellent agreement between these independent approaches. The conclusion of this cross-analysis further substantiate the accuracy of the high-dimensional shadow constraint formula proposed in this work, and we argue that this formula may serve as a universal tool for constraining the characteristic parameters of other high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole solutions.</description>

Abstract: We study scalar and electromagnetic perturbations of three families of regular black holes, Hayward, Bardeen, and Ayon-Beato-Garc\'ia immersed in a Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM) background. Using both the sixth-order WKB approximation and the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM), we determine the corresponding quasi-normal modes and absorption cross sections. By fixing the horizon radius , we analyze the dependence of the parameters of the black holes and the parameter of PFDM. The computed quasi-normal modes confirming the dynamical stability of the black holes under scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. Furthermore, both the real and imaginary parts of the quasi-normal modes increase with the multipole number $l$, corresponding to higher oscillation frequencies and faster damping rates. On the other hand absorption cross sections compared under similar parametric conditions. The results demonstrate that PFDM influences the dynamical properties of regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Overlapping signals in next-generation gravitational wave observatories: A recipe for selecting the best parameter estimation technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have significantly better sensitivities than current detectors, as well as a wider frequency bandwidth. This will increase the number and duration of the observed signals, leading to many signals overlapping in time. If not adequately accounted for, this can lead to biases in parameter estimation. In this work, we combine the joint parameter estimation method with relative binning to handle full parameter inference on overlapping signals from binary black holes, including precession effects and higher-order mode content. As this method is computationally more expensive than traditional single-signal parameter estimation, we test a prior-informed Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method for estimating expected bias to help us decide when joint parameter estimation is necessary over the simpler methods. We improve upon previous Fisher matrix implementations by including the prior information and performing an optimization routine to better locate the maximum likelihood point point, but we still find the method unreliable. The time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of close binary black hole mergers. We end by developing our own method of estimating bias due overlaps, where we reweight the single signal parameter estimation posterior to quantify how much the overlapping signals affect it. We show it has 99% accuracy for zero noise injections (98% in Gaussian noise), at the cost of one additional standard sampling run when joint parameter estimation proves to be necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the optical appearance from thin accretion disks in parametrized black holes, namely, solutions characterized by an arbitrarily large number of parameters without any regards to the theory of the gravitational and matter fields they come from. More precisely, we consider the leading-order terms of the spherically symmetric Johanssen-Psaltis (JP) and Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parametrizations after imposing constraints from asymptotic flatness and solar system observations. Furthermore, we use the inferred correlation, by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, between the size of the bright ring (which is directly observable) and the size of the central brightness depression (which is not) of M87 and Sgr A$^*$ central supermassive objects, to constrain the parameters of the leading-order JP and KRZ solutions. Using ten samples of the Standard Unbound distribution previously employed in the literature to reproduce certain scenarios of General Relativistic HydroDynamical simulations, we produce images of four samples of JP and KRZ geometries enhancing and diminishing the shadow's size, respectively. Via a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the features of the corresponding photon rings and, in particular, of their relative brightness, we argue that it should be possible to distinguish between such parametrized solutions and the Schwarzschild geometry via future upgrades of very long baseline interferometry. We furthermore consider images of some naked objects within these parametrizations, and also discuss the role of inclination in comparing images of different black holes.</description>

      <title>The Weyl Geometric Gravity black hole in light of the Solar System tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weyl geometric gravity theory, in which the gravitational action is constructed from the square of the Weyl curvature scalar and the strength of the Weyl vector, has been intensively investigated recently. The theory admits a scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field equations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As compared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution contains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate, respectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and obtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole at the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general relativity (gravitational redshift, the E\"{o}tv\"{o}s parameter and the universality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion precession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo delay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be fully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic tests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct four-dimensional gravity theories that resolve the Schwarzschild singularity and enable dynamical studies of nonsingular gravitational collapse. The construction employs a class of nonpolynomial curvature invariants that produce actions with (i) second-order equations of motion in spherical symmetry and (ii) a Birkhoff theorem, ensuring uniqueness of the spherically symmetric solution. Upon spherical reduction to two dimensions, these theories map to a particular subclass of Horndeski scalar-tensor models, which we use to explicitly verify the formation of regular black holes as the byproduct of the collapse of pressureless stars and thin-shells. We also show that linear perturbations on top of maximally symmetric backgrounds are governed by second-order equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ Bozza's method to calculate the deflection angle of light in the presence of the strong gravitational field generated by an improved Schwarzschild-like black hole whose metric, regular throughout the entire spacetime, was derived using the improved Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). This framework incorporates effective quantum gravity corrections that resolve the physical singularity inside the black hole, quantified by a model parameter $\vert \tilde{Q}_{c}\vert$. In addition, the event horizon, the photon sphere, and the shadow radius receive modifications characterized by a second model parameter $\tilde{Q}_{b}$. Using observational properties of the supermassive black holes Messier~87$\ast$ and Sagittarius~A$\ast$ reported by the Event Horizon Telescope, we derive constraints on the parameter $\vert \tilde{Q}_{b}\vert$, namely $0 \leq \vert \tilde{Q}_{b}\vert \leq 0.3$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first constraints reported in the literature for this improved GUP parameter. Since $\vert \tilde{Q}_{c}\vert$ does not play a significant role in the correction of the shadow radius, it was not possible to impose restrictions on its allowed values. However, it is important to consider a non-zero $\vert \tilde{Q}_{c}\vert$ in order to avoid a black hole singularity.</description>

      <title>Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in relativistic accretion discs</title>

Abstract: We compute relativistic Lindblad torques for circular, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded in relativistic thin accretion discs, including spinning black hole configurations. We find that relativistic effects can amplify the magnitude of these torques by orders of magnitude in the strong-field regime, and that the torque can even reverse direction as the EMRI approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). However, we show that the location of this reversal is highly spin-dependent, shifting progressively closer to the ISCO, where gravitational-wave emission completely dominates the inspiral, as the spin of the central black hole increases. Spin also modifies the radial dependence of the Lindblad torques. We investigate whether Lindblad torques can be approximated by parametrised power laws of the form T_LR = A(r_s / 10M)^n_r (or combinations thereof), and find significant spin- and disc-dependent variations in the slope parameter n_r. For instance, for spin a/M = 0.9, we find n_r = 3.6 in the strong-field regime, compared to the Newtonian value of n_r = 4.5. Given current forecasts of parameter recovery for ``golden'', loud EMRIs in accretion discs (\Delta n_r ~ 0.5), we predict LISA could distinguish between different disc configurations through their relativistic Lindblad torque signatures, providing the first direct probe of the midplane structure of the inner region of accretion discs, which is inaccessible to electromagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>Radial kinks in the boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time evolution of radial kinks in the background of boson stars. In particular, we consider two types of boson stars: the massive boson star and the solitonic boson star. For each boson star, we study the dynamics of the kinks with four different compactnesses. We observe that the greater the compactness is, the slower the kinks move towards the origin of the boson stars, indicating that the compactness will hinder the kinks to collide with the origin. Additionally, it is found that when the boson star is highly compact, a new kink may turn out after the kink colliding with the origin, instead of immediately dissipating into the background. We then propose that the radial kinks may potentially serve as a means to probe the internal structures of dense astrophysical objects, even the interior structure of black holes.</description>

      <title>Observable spins in gravitational waves from compact binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations. Measurements from the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the loudness of the gravitational-wave events- loud events typically have close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact binaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on the understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences.</description>

      <title>Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Principle Experiment on a Displacement-Noise-Free Neutron Interferometer for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is designed to eliminate all displacement-induced noise while retaining sensitivity to gravitational wave (GW) signals. Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state w_X(z) as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at {z_i}={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33}, and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1\sigma for $\rho_X(z)$ &amp; ~ 2$\sigma$ for w_X(z) at z=2/3. We also find that measuring {$\rho_X(z_i)$} is preferred to measuring {w_X(z_i)} by model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as well as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Varying the choice of redshift values of the $\rho_X(z)$ measurements leads to very consistent results, with AIC/BIC slightly favoring the case of our fiducial {z_i} with z=4/3 omitted. We find agreement with a cosmological constant except for the 1-2$\sigma$ deviation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, where DESI DR2 BAO measurements deviate from a cosmological constant at similar statistical significance. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

      <title>New constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, via analyzing \emph{Planck} \&amp; ACT \&amp; SPT CMB and DESI BAO data combination. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions, assuming a uniform prior for $\Omega_{\rm gw}h^{2}$. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). In contrast, if a log-uniform prior was assumed for $\Omega_{\rm gw}h^{2}$, these constraints can become tighter by a factor of $\sim4$, suggesting the results to be prior-sensitive. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \&amp; CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.5 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 1.0 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints we obtained in this work provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.</description>

      <title>Decoding the string in terms of holographic quantum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that the Nambu-Goto equation for a string emerges from the junction conditions in three-dimensional gravity. Holographically, gravitational junctions are dual to interfaces in conformal field theory. We demonstrate that each stringy mode of the junction corresponds to a universal $\mathcal{H}_{in}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{out}$ quantum map between in and out Hilbert spaces of excitations scattered at the interface, and also a universal $\mathcal{H}_{L}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{R}$ quantum map relating the excitations on both sides. These quantum maps generalize those realized by defect operators, preserve the conformal boundary condition at the interface, and realize a tunable energy transmitter.</description>

      <title>Particles before symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard model of particle physics is usually cast in symmetry-first terms. Recently, a geometry-first picture has been proposed, in which the relevant symmetries do not appear explicitly at the ground level of ontology. In this paper I extend this approach to two central mechanisms of the standard model: spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Yukawa coupling, both essential for particles to acquire mass. These reformulations offer alternative explanations cast in purely geometric terms. For example, a particle's quantum numbers correspond to the internal space it inhabits and to the geometric type of object it is (e.g. an $(n,m)$-tensor). I argue that a symmetry-first account in terms of principal and associated bundles admits a genuine geometry-first counterpart only when the group's representation coincides with the automorphism group of the fibre -- a condition that cuts the slack tolerated by the symmetry-first view.</description>
