      <title>Further fundamental bounds on the Hall effect in three-dimensional metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of bounding the effective nonreciprocal properties of metamaterials. Recently, significant progress was made by showing that this problem can be reduced to bounding an equivalent reciprocal one and applying a monotonicity argument. Here, we build upon this result and provide bounds incorporating additional information about the metamaterial. Specifically, in the two-phase case, we provide bounds for isotropic metamaterials. In the multiphase case, we provide bounds for uniaxial metamaterials that additionally incorporate the volume fractions. In both instances, the incorporated additional information significantly tightens the bounds. In the two-phase case, we evaluate the bounds by comparing them to the effective properties of hierarchical laminate microstructures. This comparison ultimately leads us to propose a set of conjectured bounds. While our discussion focuses on the Hall effect, our results are more broadly applicable to other nonreciprocal effects in so far as their mathematical description is equivalent. In particular, our bounds apply to the Faraday effect in the quasistatic regime and in the absence of losses and resonances.</description>

      <title>When Energy-Efficiency May Not Yield Positive Climate Impact -- The Case of Adaptive Radiative Coolers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The climate impact of building envelopes is often quantified using their energy savings and CO2 emission reduction benefits. However, building envelopes also trap solar and thermal infrared heat, which is dissipated as a direct heating penalty into our warming planet. For static or adaptive envelopes that passively heat buildings by radiatively retaining heat, these two effects are antagonistic. Yet, their net effect remains unexplored. In this study, we compare the emission reductions benefit, and direct heating penalty of two classes of roof envelopes, traditional and adaptive radiative coolers (TRCs and ARCs). Calculations for buildings in different urban climates show that relative to TRCs like cool roofs, ARCs like smart roofs may have a net heating impact on earth well past this century. Thus, despite their relative energy savings and CO2 emissions reductions benefits, adaptive envelopes on roofs have a negative climate impact relative to traditional cooling designs. Our findings are generalizable across climates and a range of building envelopes and call for a rethinking of how sustainability is quantified for building envelopes, and of material and architectural design for buildings.</description>

      <title>How to Identify Suitable Gate Dielectrics for Transistors based on Two-Dimensional Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent progress in nanosheet transistors has established two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors as viable candidates for future ultra-scaled electronic devices. Next to reducing contact resistance, identifying good gate dielectrics is a fundamental challenge, as the dielectric/channel interface dramatically impacts virtually all performance parameters. While several promising gate dielectrics have recently been reported, the evaluation of their quality and suitability is often fragmentary and focused on selected important performance metrics of the gate stack, such as the capacitive gate control, leakage currents, reliability, and ease of fabrication and integration. However, identifying a suitable gate stack is a complex problem that has not yet been approached systematically. In this perspective, we aim to formulate general criteria for good gate dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Radiation-induced Ionization Effects and Space Mission Requirements for Silicon Photonic Mach-Zehnder Modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits have become essential for meeting the growing global demand for high-capacity information processing and transport. Assessing their radiation tolerance is essential for deploying systems in radiation prone environments - including in space, high-energy particle accelerators, and defense radiation testing facilities - where the performance and compactness of photonic integrated circuits are increasingly advantageous. This work investigates the analog and digital radio frequency electro-optic performance of Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) subject to 10-keV X-ray irradiation, which mimics cumulative ionization effects in space flight. Silicon photonic MZMs serve as excellent exemplars since they are interferometric devices comprised of elements common to many integrated photonic circuits. Under standard bias conditions, the irradiated MZMs exhibited significantly reduced bandwidth, a corresponding eye closure and baud rate dependent increases in the estimated error rate. The observed performance degradation is attributed to total ionizing dose effects which leads to hole trapping at the silicon/silicon dioxide waveguide interfaces as well as fast traps with energies near the conduction band edge. Notably, when MZMs were irradiated with all leads grounded, no radiation sensitivity to the electro-optic response was observed highlighting the importance of testing under standard operating conditions for ground-based radiation testing as well as on-orbit studies. Understanding the radiation induced performance degradation of MZMs and other integrated photonic devices is increasingly important for space and accelerator environments as performance requirements and deployment opportunities increase.</description>

      <title>Broadband High-Temperature Multilayer Pyramid-Shaped Metamaterial Thermal Absorber for Thermophotovoltaic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A broadband, thermally stable absorber is essential for thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems to simultaneously convert solar and industrial waste heat into usable energy to meet growing power demands. Here, we proposed an ingenious polarization-independent truncated pyramid-shaped symmetric multilayer metamaterial absorber in a metal-insulator-metal-insulator (MIMI) architecture with almost complete absorption over a broad wavelength range. A total of six structures (W/AlN, Mo/AlN, Ta/AlN, Rh/MgO, Rh/SiO2, Re/BN) were designed, and the materials were selected based on their lattice matching to prevent delamination at interfaces between layers. The absorption mechanism was studied at room temperature using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, and the structure was optimized through a brute force design approach, which illustrates a best average absorption of 98.2% till 4000 nm and 97.73% till 5072 nm wavelength for the W/AlN structure with metal and dielectric thicknesses of 60 nm and 17.5 nm, respectively. Moreover, W/AlN structure exhibits over 96% average absorption up to 50 degree incident angles irrespective of polarizations. The thermal stability was evaluated using the finite element method (FEM) by determining von Mises stress at elevated temperatures. Thermal analysis revealed that only W/AlN can withstand around 1700 K temperature and 1500 times the incident power before permanent deformation. A temperature-dependent Drude-Lorentz model was used to further analyze the effect of absorption on the optical performance of the highly absorptive and thermally stable W/AlN structure. Additionally, we determined the effect of the concentration factor, and the operating temperature on the system efficiency by considering the emission loss of the heated absorber.</description>

      <title>Holographic lasing with dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-emitting metasurfaces provide a compact, integrated solution for simultaneous light generation and beam shaping, making them a promising candidate for advanced photonic applications. However, existing approaches for tailoring far-field emission patterns primarily operate in the spontaneous emission regime, where low coherence limits precise light control. Here, we present a light-emitting metasurface system with holographic lasing output, composed of a binary-structured metasurface integrated with a gain medium, that enables coherent light generation and precise beam shaping of the output lasing emission. With a compact footprint, low lasing threshold, and wide field of view, our system offers an exceptional platform for generating arbitrarily-structured lasing light, with significant potential for miniaturized optical systems.</description>

      <title>Benefits of Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.</description>

      <title>Rapid muon tomography for border security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security applications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense objects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons as they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable solution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of shipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this study, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of muon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various smuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a novel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image reconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in real time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies between actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds. This method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads composed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike traditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon tomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few seconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before a statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning throughput without disrupting trade flow.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of self-powered photodetector materials based on Ni-doped ZnO/p-Si heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Ni-doped ZnO films were grown on a p-type silicon substrate via spray pyrolysis. The Ni dopant concentrations were varied by adjusting the weight ratio between Zinc Acetate Dehydrate (ZAD) and Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate (NCH), resulting in the ZnO, ZnO:Ni1%, and ZnO:Ni3% samples. Field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images revealed that Ni doping significantly reduced the nanostructure size from 326 nm (ZnO) to 146 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Similarly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also shows the decrease of the crystallite size with increasing Ni doping, from 44 nm (ZnO) to 35 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were conducted at a bias voltage of 0 and 5 V to examine electrical and self-powered photodetection properties. All samples demonstrate self-powered photodetector performance. At the bias of 0 V, the undoped ZnO exhibited a higher photo-to-dark-current ratio (162) as compared to ZnO:Ni1% (18) and ZnO:Ni3% (16). The ZnO:Ni3% samples displayed faster rise (0.4 s) and fall times (1.7 s) as compared to the pure ZnO (10.8 s for rise time and 9.1 s for fall time), highlighting their potential for applications requiring rapid photoresponse. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the performance of ZnO-based photodetectors through controlled Ni doping, enabling advancements in self-powered photodetection technology for energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Controlled Planar Czochralski Growth of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar Czochralski growth, a novel method for programming the quasi-monocrystalline growth of low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure uniform crystalline properties across large areas is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) exhibiting a high breakdown field (&gt; 5.3 MV/cm) and a low contact resistance (~1.55 {\Omega}mm), tailored for high-power radiofrequency applications. A split-doped barrier architecture, employing two distinct doping concentrations, is shown to enhance both the breakdown field and contact resistance. This design enables a state-of-the-art combination of maximum drain current (487 mA/mm) and breakdown field, along with a high cutoff frequency of 7.2 GHz. These results demonstrate a viable pathway to push device performance toward the material limits while minimizing contact resistance in UWBG AlGaN HFETs, paving the way for next-generation high-power, high-frequency applications.</description>
