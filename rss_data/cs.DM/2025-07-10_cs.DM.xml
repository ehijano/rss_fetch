      <title>Improved Lower Bounds on Multiflow-Multicut Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of source-sink pairs, the maximum multiflow problem asks for the maximum total amount of flow that can be feasibly routed between them. The minimum multicut, a dual problem to multiflow, seeks the minimum-cost set of edges whose removal disconnects all the source-sink pairs. It is easy to see that the value of the minimum multicut is at least that of the maximum multiflow, and their ratio is called the multiflow-multicut gap. The classical max-flow min-cut theorem states that when there is only one source-sink pair, the gap is exactly one. However, in general, it is well known that this gap can be arbitrarily large. In this paper, we study this gap for classes of planar graphs and establish improved lower bound results. In particular, we show that this gap is at least $\frac{20}{9}$ for the class of planar graphs, improving upon the decades-old lower bound of 2. More importantly, we develop new techniques for proving such a lower bound, which may be useful in other settings as well.</description>

      <title>The Integrality Gap of the Traveling Salesman Problem is $4/3$ if the LP Solution Has at Most $n+6$ Non-zero Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the classical Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson formulation of the metric Traveling Salesman Problem and study the integrality gap of its linear relaxation, namely the Subtour Elimination Problem (SEP). This integrality gap is conjectured to be $4/3$. We prove that, when solving a problem on $n$ nodes, if the optimal SEP solution has at most $n+6$ non-zero components, then the conjecture is true. To establish this result, we consider, for a given integer $k$, the infinite family $F_k$ which gathers, among all the vertices of all the SEP polytopes for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the ones with exactly $n+k$ non-zero components. Then, we introduce a procedure that reduces the description of $F_k$ to a finite set, and we present the Gap-Bounding algorithm, which provides provable upper bounds on the integrality gap for entire families $F_k$. The application of the Gap-Bounding algorithm for $k \leq 6$ yields a computer-aided proof that the conjectured bound holds in this case.</description>

      <title>On Construction of Approximate Real Mutually Unbiased Bases for an infinite class of dimensions $d \not\equiv 0 \bmod 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that real Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) do not exist for any dimension $d &gt; 2$ which is not divisible by 4. Thus, the next combinatorial question is how one can construct Approximate Real MUBs (ARMUBs) in this direction with encouraging parameters. In this paper, for the first time, we show that it is possible to construct $&gt; \lceil \sqrt{d} \rceil$ many ARMUBs for certain odd dimensions $d$ of the form $d = (4n-t)s$, $t = 1, 2, 3$, where $n$ is a natural number and $s$ is an odd prime power. Our method exploits any available $4n \times 4n$ real Hadamard matrix $H_{4n}$ (conjectured to be true) and uses this to construct an orthogonal matrix ${Y}_{4n-t}$ of size $(4n - t) \times (4n - t)$, such that the absolute value of each entry varies a little from $\frac{1}{4n-t}$. In our construction, the absolute value of the inner product between any pair of basis vectors from two different ARMUBs will be $\leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}(1 + O(d^{-\frac{1}{2}})) &lt; 2$, for proper choices of parameters, the class of dimensions $d$ being infinitely large.</description>

      <title>Real-time Optimization of Transport Chains for Single Wagon Load Railway Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The freight branch of the Swiss national railways, SBB Cargo, offers customers to ship single or few wagons within its wagon load transportation system (WLV). In this system, wagons travel along a transport chain which is a sequence of consecutive trains. Recently, SBB Cargo redesigned its IT systems and renewed the computation of these transport chains. This paper describes the main design decisions and technical details: data structures, search algorithms, mathematical optimization of throughput in the real-time setting, and some selected details for making the algorithms work in the operational software. We also comment on the employed technology stack and finally demonstrate some performance metrics from running operations.</description>

      <title>The Price of Upwardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Not every directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is planar admits an upward planar drawing. We are interested in pushing the notion of upward drawings beyond planarity by considering upward $k$-planar drawings of DAGs in which the edges are monotonically increasing in a common direction and every edge is crossed at most $k$ times for some integer $k \ge 1$. We show that the number of crossings per edge in a monotone drawing is in general unbounded for the class of bipartite outerplanar, cubic, or bounded pathwidth DAGs. However, it is at most two for outerpaths and it is at most quadratic in the bandwidth in general. From the computational point of view, we prove that testing upward-$k$-planarity is NP-complete already for $k=1$ and even for restricted instances for which upward planarity testing is polynomial. On the positive side, we can decide in linear time whether a single-source DAG admits an upward 1-planar drawing in which all vertices are incident to the outer face.</description>
