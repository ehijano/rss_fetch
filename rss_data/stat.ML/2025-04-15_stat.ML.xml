      <title>Double Machine Learning for Causal Inference under Shared-State Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers and practitioners often wish to measure treatment effects in settings where units interact via markets and recommendation systems. In these settings, units are affected by certain shared states, like prices, algorithmic recommendations or social signals. We formalize this structure, calling it shared-state interference, and argue that our formulation captures many relevant applied settings. Our key modeling assumption is that individuals' potential outcomes are independent conditional on the shared state. We then prove an extension of a double machine learning (DML) theorem providing conditions for achieving efficient inference under shared-state interference. We also instantiate our general theorem in several models of interest where it is possible to efficiently estimate the average direct effect (ADE) or global average treatment effect (GATE).</description>

      <title>Improving the evaluation of samplers on multi-modal targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing multi-modality constitutes one of the major challenges of sampling. In this reflection paper, we advocate for a more systematic evaluation of samplers towards two sources of difficulty that are mode separation and dimension. For this, we propose a synthetic experimental setting that we illustrate on a selection of samplers, focusing on the challenging criterion of recovery of the mode relative importance. These evaluations are crucial to diagnose the potential of samplers to handle multi-modality and therefore to drive progress in the field.</description>

      <title>An Incremental Non-Linear Manifold Approximation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing high-dimensional data presents challenges due to the "curse of dimensionality'', making computations intensive. Dimension reduction techniques, categorized as linear or non-linear, simplify such data. Non-linear methods are particularly essential for efficiently visualizing and processing complex data structures in interactive and graphical applications. This research develops an incremental non-linear dimension reduction method using the Geometric Multi-Resolution Analysis (GMRA) framework for streaming data. The proposed method enables real-time data analysis and visualization by incrementally updating the cluster map, PCA basis vectors, and wavelet coefficients. Numerical experiments show that the incremental GMRA accurately represents non-linear manifolds even with small initial samples and aligns closely with batch GMRA, demonstrating efficient updates and maintaining the multiscale structure. The findings highlight the potential of Incremental GMRA for real-time visualization and interactive graphics applications that require adaptive high-dimensional data representations.</description>

      <title>Dose-finding design based on level set estimation in phase I cancer clinical trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of phase I cancer clinical trials is to evaluate the safety of a new experimental treatment and to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). We show that the MTD estimation problem can be regarded as a level set estimation (LSE) problem whose objective is to determine the regions where an unknown function value is above or below a given threshold. Then, we propose a novel dose-finding design in the framework of LSE. The proposed design determines the next dose on the basis of an acquisition function incorporating uncertainty in the posterior distribution of the dose-toxicity curve as well as overdose control. Simulation experiments show that the proposed LSE design achieves a higher accuracy in estimating the MTD and involves a lower risk of overdosing allocation compared to existing designs, thereby indicating that it provides an effective methodology for phase I cancer clinical trial design.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Generative Modeling via Parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel generative modeling framework based on a discretized parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, which emerges as a continuous limit of the Sinkhorn algorithm commonly used in optimal transport. Our method performs iterative refinement in the space of Brenier maps using a mirror gradient descent step. We establish theoretical guarantees for generative modeling through the lens of no-regret analysis, demonstrating that the iterates converge to the optimal Brenier map under a variety of step-size schedules. As a technical contribution, we derive a new Evolution Variational Inequality tailored to the parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, connecting geometry, transportation cost, and regret. Our framework accommodates non-log-concave target distributions, constructs an optimal sampling process via the Brenier map, and integrates favorable learning techniques from generative adversarial networks and score-based diffusion models. As direct applications, we illustrate how our theory paves new pathways for generative modeling and variational inference.</description>

      <title>Inferring Outcome Means of Exponential Family Distributions Estimated by Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for prediction, inference on estimated means for categorical or exponential family outcomes remains underexplored. We address this gap by framing the problem within the generalized linear models (GLMs) framework and developing a rigorous statistical approach for inference on DNN-estimated means. To address a key limitation of assuming independence between prediction errors and input variables in the literature, which often fails in GLMs, we introduce a truncation technique that partitions the problem into regimes with distinct noise behaviors, enabling refined analysis and robust theoretical guarantees under general GLM frameworks. To implement inference, we consider an Ensemble Subsampling Method (ESM) that leverages U-statistics and the Hoeffding decomposition to construct reliable confidence intervals. This method enables model-free variance estimation and accounts for heterogeneity among individuals in the population. Through extensive simulations across Binary, Poisson and Binomial models, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. We further apply the method to real-world data from the eICU dataset to predict patient readmission risks, providing actionable insights for clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Optimal sparse phase retrieval via a quasi-Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of sparse phase retrieval, a fundamental inverse problem in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering, where a signal need to be reconstructed using only the magnitude of its transformation while phase information remains inaccessible. Leveraging the inherent sparsity of many real-world signals, we introduce a novel sparse quasi-Bayesian approach and provide the first theoretical guarantees for such an approach. Specifically, we employ a scaled Student distribution as a continuous shrinkage prior to enforce sparsity and analyze the method using the PAC-Bayesian inequality framework. Our results establish that the proposed Bayesian estimator achieves minimax-optimal convergence rates under sub-exponential noise, matching those of state-of-the-art frequentist methods. To ensure computational feasibility, we develop an efficient Langevin Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs comparably to existing frequentist techniques, highlighting its potential as a principled alternative for sparse phase retrieval in noisy settings.</description>

      <title>Conditional Independence Test Based on Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing conditional independence between two random vectors given a third is a fundamental and challenging problem in statistics, particularly in multivariate nonparametric settings due to the complexity of conditional structures. We propose a novel framework for testing conditional independence using transport maps. At the population level, we show that two well-defined transport maps can transform the conditional independence test into an unconditional independence test, this substantially simplifies the problem. These transport maps are estimated from data using conditional continuous normalizing flow models. Within this framework, we derive a test statistic and prove its consistency under both the null and alternative hypotheses. A permutation-based procedure is employed to evaluate the significance of the test. We validate the proposed method through extensive simulations and real-data analysis. Our numerical studies demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method for conditional independence testing.</description>

      <title>Offline Dynamic Inventory and Pricing Strategy: Addressing Censored and Dependent Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline sequential feature-based pricing and inventory control problem where the current demand depends on the past demand levels and any demand exceeding the available inventory is lost. Our goal is to leverage the offline dataset, consisting of past prices, ordering quantities, inventory levels, covariates, and censored sales levels, to estimate the optimal pricing and inventory control policy that maximizes long-term profit. While the underlying dynamic without censoring can be modeled by Markov decision process (MDP), the primary obstacle arises from the observed process where demand censoring is present, resulting in missing profit information, the failure of the Markov property, and a non-stationary optimal policy. To overcome these challenges, we first approximate the optimal policy by solving a high-order MDP characterized by the number of consecutive censoring instances, which ultimately boils down to solving a specialized Bellman equation tailored for this problem. Inspired by offline reinforcement learning and survival analysis, we propose two novel data-driven algorithms to solving these Bellman equations and, thus, estimate the optimal policy. Furthermore, we establish finite sample regret bounds to validate the effectiveness of these algorithms. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in estimating the optimal policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data-driven approach to learning optimal pricing and inventory control policies in a sequential decision-making environment characterized by censored and dependent demand. The implementations of the proposed algorithms are available at https://github.com/gundemkorel/Inventory_Pricing_Control</description>

      <title>Conditional Distribution Compression via the Kernel Conditional Mean Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods, like Kernel Herding (KH), were originally developed for unlabelled data. However, no existing approach directly compresses the conditional distribution of labelled data. To address this gap, we first introduce the Average Maximum Conditional Mean Discrepancy (AMCMD), a natural metric for comparing conditional distributions. We then derive a consistent estimator for the AMCMD and establish its rate of convergence. Next, we make a key observation: in the context of distribution compression, the cost of constructing a compressed set targeting the AMCMD can be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Building on this, we extend the idea of KH to develop Average Conditional Kernel Herding (ACKH), a linear-time greedy algorithm that constructs a compressed set targeting the AMCMD. To better understand the advantages of directly compressing the conditional distribution rather than doing so via the joint distribution, we introduce Joint Kernel Herding (JKH), a straightforward adaptation of KH designed to compress the joint distribution of labelled data. While herding methods provide a simple and interpretable selection process, they rely on a greedy heuristic. To explore alternative optimisation strategies, we propose Joint Kernel Inducing Points (JKIP) and Average Conditional Kernel Inducing Points (ACKIP), which jointly optimise the compressed set while maintaining linear complexity. Experiments show that directly preserving conditional distributions with ACKIP outperforms both joint distribution compression (via JKH and JKIP) and the greedy selection used in ACKH. Moreover, we see that JKIP consistently outperforms JKH.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Sensor Steering Strategy Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Data Acquisition in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensor steering methodology based on deep reinforcement learning to enhance the predictive accuracy and decision support capabilities of digital twins by optimising the data acquisition process. Traditional sensor placement techniques are often constrained by one-off optimisation strategies, which limit their applicability for online applications requiring continuous informative data assimilation. The proposed approach addresses this limitation by offering an adaptive framework for sensor placement within the digital twin paradigm. The sensor placement problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the training and deployment of an agent capable of dynamically repositioning sensors in response to the evolving conditions of the physical structure as represented by the digital twin. This ensures that the digital twin maintains a highly representative and reliable connection to its physical counterpart. The proposed framework is validated through a series of comprehensive case studies involving a cantilever plate structure subjected to diverse conditions, including healthy and damaged conditions. The results demonstrate the capability of the deep reinforcement learning agent to adaptively reposition sensors improving the quality of data acquisition and hence enhancing the overall accuracy of digital twins.</description>

      <title>Learning with Positive and Imperfect Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning binary classifiers from positive and unlabeled data when the unlabeled data distribution is shifted, which we call Positive and Imperfect Unlabeled (PIU) Learning. In the absence of covariate shifts, i.e., with perfect unlabeled data, Denis (1998) reduced this problem to learning under Massart noise; however, that reduction fails under even slight shifts.
  Our main results on PIU learning are the characterizations of the sample complexity of PIU learning and a computationally and sample-efficient algorithm achieving a misclassification error $\varepsilon$. We further show that our results lead to new algorithms for several related problems.
  1. Learning from smooth distributions: We give algorithms that learn interesting concept classes from only positive samples under smooth feature distributions, bypassing known existing impossibility results and contributing to recent advances in smoothened learning (Haghtalab et al, J.ACM'24) (Chandrasekaran et al., COLT'24).
  2. Learning with a list of unlabeled distributions: We design new algorithms that apply to a broad class of concept classes under the assumption that we are given a list of unlabeled distributions, one of which--unknown to the learner--is $O(1)$-close to the true feature distribution.
  3. Estimation in the presence of unknown truncation: We give the first polynomial sample and time algorithm for estimating the parameters of an exponential family distribution from samples truncated to an unknown set approximable by polynomials in $L_1$-norm. This improves the algorithm by Lee et al. (FOCS'24) that requires approximation in $L_2$-norm.
  4. Detecting truncation: We present new algorithms for detecting whether given samples have been truncated (or not) for a broad class of non-product distributions, including non-product distributions, improving the algorithm by De et al. (STOC'24).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion wavelets extract information from graph signals at different scales of resolution by utilizing graph diffusion operators raised to various powers, known as diffusion scales. Traditionally, the diffusion scales are chosen to be dyadic integers, $\mathbf{2^j}$. Here, we propose a novel, unsupervised method for selecting the diffusion scales based on ideas from information theory. We then show that our method can be incorporated into wavelet-based GNNs via graph classification experiments.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic QoS Metric Forecasting in Delay-Tolerant Networks Using Conditional Diffusion Models on Latent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active QoS metric prediction, commonly employed in the maintenance and operation of DTN, could enhance network performance regarding latency, throughput, energy consumption, and dependability. Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation For Personalized Deep Kernel Regression In Modeling Brain Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal biomedical studies monitor individuals over time to capture dynamics in brain development, disease progression, and treatment effects. However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts. We make the code available at https://github.com/vatass/AdaptiveShrinkageDKGP.</description>

      <title>In almost all shallow analytic neural network optimization landscapes, efficient minimizers have strongly convex neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether or not a local minimum of a cost function has a strongly convex neighborhood greatly influences the asymptotic convergence rate of optimizers. In this article, we rigorously analyze the prevalence of this property for the mean squared error induced by shallow, 1-hidden layer neural networks with analytic activation functions when applied to regression problems. The parameter space is divided into two domains: the 'efficient domain' (all parameters for which the respective realization function cannot be generated by a network having a smaller number of neurons) and the 'redundant domain' (the remaining parameters). In almost all regression problems on the efficient domain the optimization landscape only features local minima that are strongly convex. Formally, we will show that for certain randomly picked regression problems the optimization landscape is almost surely a Morse function on the efficient domain. The redundant domain has significantly smaller dimension than the efficient domain and on this domain, potential local minima are never isolated.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Few-Shot Fusion: Granular Ball Priors Enable General-Purpose Deep Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In image fusion tasks, due to the lack of real fused images as priors, most deep learning-based fusion methods obtain global weight features from original images in large-scale data pairs to generate images that approximate real fused images. However, unlike previous studies, this paper utilizes Granular Ball adaptation to extract features in the brightness space as priors for deep networks, enabling the fusion network to converge quickly and complete the fusion task. This leads to few-shot training for a general image fusion network, and based on this, we propose the GBFF fusion method. According to the information expression division of pixel pairs in the original fused image, we classify pixel pairs with significant performance as the positive domain and non-significant pixel pairs as the boundary domain. We perform split inference in the brightness space using Granular Ball adaptation to compute weights for pixels that express information to varying degrees, generating approximate supervision images that provide priors for the neural network in the structural brightness space. Additionally, the extracted global saliency features also adaptively provide priors for setting the loss function weights of each image in the network, guiding the network to converge quickly at both global and pixel levels alongside the supervised images, thereby enhancing the expressiveness of the fused images. Each modality only used 10 pairs of images as the training set, completing the fusion task with a limited number of iterations. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the algorithm and theory, and qualitative and quantitative comparisons with SOTA methods show that this approach is highly competitive in terms of fusion time and image expressiveness.</description>

      <title>Perfect Clustering in Nonuniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there has been tremendous activity in the area of statistical network inference on graphs, hypergraphs have not enjoyed the same attention, on account of their relative complexity and the lack of tractable statistical models. We introduce a hyper-edge-centric model for analyzing hypergraphs, called the interaction hypergraph, which models natural sampling methods for hypergraphs in neuroscience and communication networks, and accommodates interactions involving different numbers of entities. We define latent embeddings for the interactions in such a network, and analyze their estimators. In particular, we show that a spectral estimate of the interaction latent positions can achieve perfect clustering once enough interactions are observed.</description>

      <title>High dimensional online calibration in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In online (sequential) calibration, a forecaster predicts probability distributions over a finite outcome space $[d]$ over a sequence of $T$ days, with the goal of being calibrated. While asymptotically calibrated strategies are known to exist, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the best known algorithms require $\exp(d)$ days to achieve non-trivial calibration.
  In this work, we present the first asymptotically calibrated strategy that guarantees non-trivial calibration after a polynomial number of rounds. Specifically, for any desired accuracy $\epsilon &gt; 0$, our forecaster becomes $\epsilon$-calibrated after $T = d^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ days. We complement this result with a lower bound, proving that at least $T = d^{\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))}$ rounds are necessary to achieve $\epsilon$-calibration. Our results resolve the open questions posed by [Abernethy-Mannor'11, Hazan-Kakade'12].
  Our algorithm is inspired by recent breakthroughs in swap regret minimization [Peng-Rubinstein'24, Dagan et al.'24]. Despite its strong theoretical guarantees, the approach is remarkably simple and intuitive: it randomly selects among a set of sub-forecasters, each of which predicts the empirical outcome frequency over recent time windows.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Remaining Useful Life Prediction with Scarce Time Series Data: Regression under Indirect Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised time series prediction relies on directly measured target variables, but real-world use cases such as predicting remaining useful life (RUL) involve indirect supervision, where the target variable is labeled as a function of another dependent variable. Trending temporal regression techniques rely on sequential time series inputs to capture temporal patterns, requiring interpolation when dealing with sparsely and irregularly sampled covariates along the timeline. However, interpolation can introduce significant biases, particularly with highly scarce data. In this paper, we address the RUL prediction problem with data scarcity as time series regression under indirect supervision. We introduce a unified framework called parameterized static regression, which takes single data points as inputs for regression of target values, inherently handling data scarcity without requiring interpolation. The time dependency under indirect supervision is captured via a parametrical rectification (PR) process, approximating a parametric function during inference with historical posteriori estimates, following the same underlying distribution used for labeling during training. Additionally, we propose a novel batch training technique for tasks in indirect supervision to prevent overfitting and enhance efficiency. We evaluate our model on public benchmarks for RUL prediction with simulated data scarcity. Our method demonstrates competitive performance in prediction accuracy when dealing with highly scarce time series data.</description>

      <title>FairACE: Achieving Degree Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Contrastive and Adversarial Group-Balanced Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness has been a significant challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs) since degree biases often result in un-equal prediction performance among nodes with varying degrees. Existing GNN models focus on prediction accuracy, frequently overlooking fairness across different degree groups. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric Contrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to create fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to balance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model training, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize classification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a novel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can quantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different degree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art GNN models.</description>

      <title>Regretful Decisions under Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are routinely used to support decisions that affect individuals -- be it to screen a patient for a serious illness or to gauge their response to treatment. In these tasks, we are limited to learning models from datasets with noisy labels. In this paper, we study the instance-level impact of learning under label noise. We introduce a notion of regret for this regime which measures the number of unforeseen mistakes due to noisy labels. We show that standard approaches to learning under label noise can return models that perform well at a population level while subjecting individuals to a lottery of mistakes. We present a versatile approach to estimate the likelihood of mistakes at the individual level from a noisy dataset by training models over plausible realizations of datasets without label noise. This is supported by a comprehensive empirical study of label noise in clinical prediction tasks. Our results reveal how failure to anticipate mistakes can compromise model reliability and adoption, and demonstrate how we can address these challenges by anticipating and avoiding regretful decisions.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Differentially Private Regret Bounds in Linear MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study regret minimization under privacy constraints in episodic inhomogeneous linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), motivated by the growing use of reinforcement learning (RL) in personalized decision-making systems that rely on sensitive user data. In this setting, both transition probabilities and reward functions are assumed to be linear in a feature mapping $\phi(s, a)$, and we aim to ensure privacy through joint differential privacy (JDP), a relaxation of differential privacy suited to online learning. Prior work has established suboptimal regret bounds by privatizing the LSVI-UCB algorithm, which achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 H^4 K})$ regret in the non-private setting. Building on recent advances that improve this to minimax optimal regret $\widetilde{O}(HD\sqrt{K})$ via LSVI-UCB++ with Bernstein-style bonuses, we design a new differentially private algorithm by privatizing LSVI-UCB++ and adapting techniques for variance-aware analysis from offline RL. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(d \sqrt{H^3 K} + H^{4.5} d^{7/6} K^{1/2} / \epsilon)$, improving over previous private methods. Empirical results show that our algorithm retains near-optimal utility compared to non-private baselines, indicating that privacy can be achieved with minimal performance degradation in this setting.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation on Exponential Random Graph Models: Evaluating Bias and Implementation Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are flexible probabilistic frameworks to model statistical networks through a variety of network summary statistics. Conventional Bayesian estimation for ERGMs involves iteratively exchanging with an auxiliary variable due to the intractability of ERGMs, however, this approach lacks scalability to large-scale implementations. Neural posterior estimation (NPE) is a recent advancement in simulation-based inference, using a neural network based density estimator to infer the posterior for models with doubly intractable likelihoods for which simulations can be generated. While NPE has been successfully adopted in various fields such as cosmology, little research has investigated its use for ERGMs. Performing NPE on ERGM not only provides a differing angle of resolving estimation for the intractable ERGM likelihoods but also allows more efficient and scalable inference using the amortisation properties of NPE, and therefore, we investigate how NPE can be effectively implemented in ERGMs.
  In this study, we present the first systematic implementation of NPE for ERGMs, rigorously evaluating potential biases, interpreting the biases magnitudes, and comparing NPE fittings against conventional Bayesian ERGM fittings. More importantly, our work highlights ERGM-specific areas that may impose particular challenges for the adoption of NPE.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Insurance Reserving with CVaR-Constrained Reinforcement Learning under Macroeconomic Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for insurance reserving that integrates tail-risk sensitivity, macroeconomic regime modeling, and regulatory compliance. The reserving problem is formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which reserve adjustments are optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) subject to Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraints. To enhance policy robustness across varying economic conditions, the agent is trained using a regime-aware curriculum that progressively increases volatility exposure.
  The reward structure penalizes reserve shortfall, capital inefficiency, and solvency floor violations, with design elements informed by Solvency II and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) frameworks. Empirical evaluations on two industry datasets--Workers' Compensation, and Other Liability--demonstrate that the RL-CVaR agent achieves superior performance relative to classical reserving methods across multiple criteria, including tail-risk control (CVaR$_{0.95}$), capital efficiency, and regulatory violation rate. The framework also accommodates fixed-shock stress testing and regime-stratified analysis, providing a principled and extensible approach to reserving under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Constants of motion network revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering constants of motion is meaningful in helping understand the dynamical systems, but inevitably needs proficient mathematical skills and keen analytical capabilities. With the prevalence of deep learning, methods employing neural networks, such as Constant Of Motion nETwork (COMET), are promising in handling this scientific problem. Although the COMET method can produce better predictions on dynamics by exploiting the discovered constants of motion, there is still plenty of room to sharpen it. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture, built using the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) technique, and a two-phase training algorithm to improve the performance of COMET. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only retains the advantages of COMET, such as applying to non-Hamiltonian systems and indicating the number of constants of motion, but also can be more lightweight and noise-robust than COMET.</description>

      <title>aweSOM: a CPU/GPU-accelerated Self-organizing Map and Statistically Combined Ensemble Framework for Machine-learning Clustering Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce aweSOM, an open-source Python package for machine learning (ML) clustering and classification, using a Self-organizing Maps (SOM) algorithm that incorporates CPU/GPU acceleration to accommodate large ($N &gt; 10^6$, where $N$ is the number of data points), multidimensional datasets. aweSOM consists of two main modules, one that handles the initialization and training of the SOM, and another that stacks the results of multiple SOM realizations to obtain more statistically robust clusters. Existing Python-based SOM implementations (e.g., POPSOM, Yuan (2018); MiniSom, Vettigli (2018); sklearn-som) primarily serve as proof-of-concept demonstrations, optimized for smaller datasets, but lacking scalability for large, multidimensional data. aweSOM provides a solution for this gap in capability, with good performance scaling up to $\sim 10^8$ individual points, and capable of utilizing multiple features per point. We compare the code performance against the legacy implementations it is based on, and find a 10-100x speed up, as well as significantly improved memory efficiency, due to several built-in optimizations.</description>

      <title>Quantization Error Propagation: Revisiting Layer-Wise Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layer-wise post-training quantization has emerged as a widely used technique for compressing large language models (LLMs) without retraining. However, recent progress in this line of research is saturating, underscoring the need to revisit its core limitation and explore further improvements. This study identifies a critical bottleneck in existing layer-wise PTQ methods: the accumulation of quantization errors across layers significantly degrades performance, particularly in low-bit regimes. To address this, we propose Quantization Error Propagation (QEP), a lightweight and general framework that enhances layer-wise PTQ by explicitly propagating the quantization error which enable compensating for accumulated quantization errors. Additionally, we introduce a tunable propagation mechanism that allows for control over both propagation strength and computational overhead, making the framework adaptable to various architectures and resource constraints. Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2 models (7B, 13B, 70B) demonstrate that incorporating QEP into standard layer-wise PTQ pipelines outperforms standard PTQ methods. Notably, QEP yields substantial performance improvements under extreme low-bit quantization settings.</description>

      <title>Ordinary Least Squares as an Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that ordinary least squares (OLS) predictions can be rewritten as the output of a restricted attention module, akin to those forming the backbone of large language models. This connection offers an alternative perspective on attention beyond the conventional information retrieval framework, making it more accessible to researchers and analysts with a background in traditional statistics. It falls into place when OLS is framed as a similarity-based method in a transformed regressor space, distinct from the standard view based on partial correlations. In fact, the OLS solution can be recast as the outcome of an alternative problem: minimizing squared prediction errors by optimizing the embedding space in which training and test vectors are compared via inner products. Rather than estimating coefficients directly, we equivalently learn optimal encoding and decoding operations for predictors. From this vantage point, OLS maps naturally onto the query-key-value structure of attention mechanisms. Building on this foundation, I discuss key elements of Transformer-style attention and draw connections to classic ideas from time series econometrics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Discrete Coating Degradation Events via Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting the degradation of coated materials has long been a topic of critical interest in engineering, as it has enormous implications for both system maintenance and sustainable material use. Material degradation is affected by many factors, including the history of corrosion and characteristics of the environment, which can be measured by high-frequency sensors. However, the high volume of data produced by such sensors can inhibit efficient modeling and prediction. To alleviate this issue, we propose novel metrics for representing material degradation, taking the form of discrete degradation events. These events maintain the statistical properties of continuous sensor readings, such as correlation with time to coating failure and coefficient of variation at failure, but are composed of orders of magnitude fewer measurements. To forecast future degradation of the coating system, a marked Hawkes process models the events. We use the forecast of degradation to predict a future time of failure, exhibiting superior performance to the approach based on direct modeling of galvanic corrosion using continuous sensor measurements. While such maintenance is typically done on a regular basis, degradation models can enable informed condition-based maintenance, reducing unnecessary excess maintenance and preventing unexpected failures.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Gradient Descent for Over-Parameterized Nonconvex Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practical instances of nonconvex matrix factorization, the rank of the true solution $r^{\star}$ is often unknown, so the rank $r$ of the model can be overspecified as $r&gt;r^{\star}$. This over-parameterized regime of matrix factorization significantly slows down the convergence of local search algorithms, from a linear rate with $r=r^{\star}$ to a sublinear rate when $r&gt;r^{\star}$. We propose an inexpensive preconditioner for the matrix sensing variant of nonconvex matrix factorization that restores the convergence rate of gradient descent back to linear, even in the over-parameterized case, while also making it agnostic to possible ill-conditioning in the ground truth. Classical gradient descent in a neighborhood of the solution slows down due to the need for the model matrix factor to become singular. Our key result is that this singularity can be corrected by $\ell_{2}$ regularization with a specific range of values for the damping parameter. In fact, a good damping parameter can be inexpensively estimated from the current iterate. The resulting algorithm, which we call preconditioned gradient descent or PrecGD, is stable under noise, and converges linearly to an information theoretically optimal error bound. Our numerical experiments find that PrecGD works equally well in restoring the linear convergence of other variants of nonconvex matrix factorization in the over-parameterized regime.</description>

      <title>Truncated Matrix Completion - An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank Matrix Completion (LRMC) describes the problem where we wish to recover missing entries of partially observed low-rank matrix. Most existing matrix completion work deals with sampling procedures that are independent of the underlying data values. While this assumption allows the derivation of nice theoretical guarantees, it seldom holds in real-world applications. In this paper, we consider various settings where the sampling mask is dependent on the underlying data values, motivated by applications in sensing, sequential decision-making, and recommender systems. Through a series of experiments, we study and compare the performance of various LRMC algorithms that were originally successful for data-independent sampling patterns.</description>

      <title>Towards Weaker Variance Assumptions for Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a classical assumption for analyzing stochastic gradient algorithms where the squared norm of the stochastic subgradient (or the variance for smooth problems) is allowed to grow as fast as the squared norm of the optimization variable. We contextualize this assumption in view of its inception in the 1960s, its seemingly independent appearance in the recent literature, its relationship to weakest-known variance assumptions for analyzing stochastic gradient algorithms, and its relevance in deterministic problems for non-Lipschitz nonsmooth convex optimization. We build on and extend a connection recently made between this assumption and the Halpern iteration. For convex nonsmooth, and potentially stochastic, optimization, we analyze horizon-free, anytime algorithms with last-iterate rates. For problems beyond simple constrained optimization, such as convex problems with functional constraints or regularized convex-concave min-max problems, we obtain rates for optimality measures that do not require boundedness of the feasible set.</description>

      <title>Session-based Recommender Systems: User Interest as a Stochastic Process in the Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper jointly addresses the problem of data uncertainty, popularity bias, and exposure bias in session-based recommender systems. We study the symptoms of this bias both in item embeddings and in recommendations. We propose treating user interest as a stochastic process in the latent space and providing a model-agnostic implementation of this mathematical concept. The proposed stochastic component consists of elements: debiasing item embeddings with regularization for embedding uniformity, modeling dense user interest from session prefixes, and introducing fake targets in the data to simulate extended exposure. We conducted computational experiments on two popular benchmark datasets, Diginetica and YooChoose 1/64, as well as several modifications of the YooChoose dataset with different ratios of popular items. The results show that the proposed approach allows us to mitigate the challenges mentioned.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Bayesian Optimization via Gradient-Informed Bayesian Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used method for data-driven optimization that generally relies on zeroth-order data of objective function to construct probabilistic surrogate models. These surrogates guide the exploration-exploitation process toward finding global optimum. While Gaussian processes (GPs) are commonly employed as surrogates of the unknown objective function, recent studies have highlighted the potential of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as scalable and flexible alternatives. Moreover, incorporating gradient observations into GPs, when available, has been shown to improve BO performance. However, the use of gradients within BNN surrogates remains unexplored. By leveraging automatic differentiation, gradient information can be seamlessly integrated into BNN training, resulting in more informative surrogates for BO. We propose a gradient-informed loss function for BNN training, effectively augmenting function observations with local gradient information. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on well-known benchmarks in terms of improved BNN predictions and faster BO convergence as the number of decision variables increases.</description>

Abstract: We review generalized additive models as a type of ``transparent'' model that has recently seen renewed interest in the deep learning community as neural additive models. We highlight multiple types of nonidentifiability in this model class and discuss challenges in interpretability, arguing for restraint when claiming ``interpretability'' or ``suitability for safety-critical applications'' of such models.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler excess risk bounds for exponential weighted aggregation in Generalized linear models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggregation methods have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework in statistical learning, providing unified solutions across diverse problems such as regression, classification, and density estimation. In the context of generalized linear models (GLMs), where responses follow exponential family distributions, aggregation offers an attractive alternative to classical parametric modeling. This paper investigates the problem of sparse aggregation in GLMs, aiming to approximate the true parameter vector by a sparse linear combination of predictors. We prove that an exponential weighted aggregation scheme yields a sharp oracle inequality for the Kullback-Leibler risk with leading constant equal to one, while also attaining the minimax-optimal rate of aggregation. These results are further enhanced by establishing high-probability bounds on the excess risk.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-Flow: A Unified Framework for Continuous-State Discrete Flow Matching Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the flow-matching framework to discrete generative modeling. One strand of models directly works with the continuous probabilities instead of discrete tokens, which we colloquially refer to as Continuous-State Discrete Flow Matching (CS-DFM). Existing CS-DFM models differ significantly in their representations and geometric assumptions. This work presents a unified framework for CS-DFM models, under which the existing variants can be understood as operating on different $\alpha$-representations of probabilities. Building upon the theory of information geometry, we introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a family of CS-DFM models that adheres to the canonical $\alpha$-geometry of the statistical manifold, and demonstrate its optimality in minimizing the generalized kinetic energy. Theoretically, we show that the flow matching loss for $\alpha$-flow establishes a unified variational bound for the discrete negative log-likelihood. We comprehensively evaluate different instantiations of $\alpha$-flow on various discrete generation domains to demonstrate their effectiveness in discrete generative modeling, including intermediate values whose geometries have never been explored before. $\alpha$-flow significantly outperforms its discrete-state counterpart in image and protein sequence generation and better captures the entropy in language modeling.</description>

      <title>DUE: A Deep Learning Framework and Library for Modeling Unknown Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equations, particularly differential equations, are fundamental for understanding natural phenomena and predicting complex dynamics across various scientific and engineering disciplines. However, the governing equations for many complex systems remain unknown due to intricate underlying mechanisms. Recent advancements in machine learning and data science offer a new paradigm for modeling unknown equations from measurement or simulation data. This paradigm shift, known as data-driven discovery or modeling, stands at the forefront of AI for science, with significant progress made in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework for data-driven modeling of unknown equations using deep learning. This versatile framework is capable of learning unknown ODEs, PDEs, DAEs, IDEs, SDEs, reduced or partially observed systems, and non-autonomous differential equations. Based on this framework, we have developed Deep Unknown Equations (DUE), an open-source software package designed to facilitate the data-driven modeling of unknown equations using modern deep learning techniques. DUE serves as an educational tool for classroom instruction, enabling students and newcomers to gain hands-on experience with differential equations, data-driven modeling, and contemporary deep learning approaches such as FNN, ResNet, generalized ResNet, operator semigroup networks (OSG-Net), and Transformers. Additionally, DUE is a versatile and accessible toolkit for researchers across various scientific and engineering fields. It is applicable not only for learning unknown equations from data but also for surrogate modeling of known, yet complex, equations that are costly to solve using traditional numerical methods. We provide detailed descriptions of DUE and demonstrate its capabilities through diverse examples, which serve as templates that can be easily adapted for other applications.</description>

Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? In this paper, we report the answer to be yes. Considering a random neural network in its thermodynamic limit, we first show that almost all learned periods are unstable, and each network has its own characteristic attractors (which can even be untrained ones). The latently acquired dynamics, which are unstable within the trained network, serve as a foundation for the diversity of characteristic attractors and may even lead to the emergence of attractors of all periods after learning. When the neural network interpolation is quadratic, a universal post-learning bifurcation scenario appears, which is consistent with a topological conjugacy between the trained network and the classical logistic map. In addition to universality, we explore specific properties of certain networks, including the singular behavior of the scale of weight at the infinite limit, the finite-size effects, and the symmetry in learning period three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a computationally efficient and scalable methodology for approximate Bayesian inference. It strikes a balance between accuracy of uncertainty quantification and practical tractability. It excels at generative modelling and inversion tasks due to its built-in Bayesian regularisation and flexibility, essential qualities for physics related problems. For such problems, the underlying physical model determines the dependence between variables of interest, which in turn will require a tailored derivation for the central VI learning objective. Furthermore, in many physical inference applications this structure has rich meaning and is essential for accurately capturing the dynamics of interest. In this paper, we provide an accessible and thorough technical introduction to VI for forward and inverse problems, guiding the reader through standard derivations of the VI framework and how it can best be realized through deep learning. We then review and unify recent literature exemplifying the flexibility allowed by VI. This paper is designed for a general scientific audience looking to solve physics-based problems with an emphasis on uncertainty quantification</description>

      <title>Automatic debiasing of neural networks via moment-constrained learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal and nonparametric estimands in economics and biostatistics can often be viewed as the mean of a linear functional applied to an unknown outcome regression function. Naively learning the regression function and taking a sample mean of the target functional results in biased estimators, and a rich debiasing literature has developed where one additionally learns the so-called Riesz representer (RR) of the target estimand (targeted learning, double ML, automatic debiasing etc.). Learning the RR via its derived functional form can be challenging, e.g. due to extreme inverse probability weights or the need to learn conditional density functions. Such challenges have motivated recent advances in automatic debiasing (AD), where the RR is learned directly via minimization of a bespoke loss. We propose moment-constrained learning as a new RR learning approach that addresses some shortcomings in AD, constraining the predicted moments and improving the robustness of RR estimates to optimization hyperparamters. Though our approach is not tied to a particular class of learner, we illustrate it using neural networks, and evaluate on the problems of average treatment/derivative effect estimation using semi-synthetic data. Our numerical experiments show improved performance versus state of the art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Robust Barycenter Estimation using Semi-Unbalanced Neural Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aggregating data from multiple sources can be formalized as an Optimal Transport (OT) barycenter problem, which seeks to compute the average of probability distributions with respect to OT discrepancies. However, in real-world scenarios, the presence of outliers and noise in the data measures can significantly hinder the performance of traditional statistical methods for estimating OT barycenters. To address this issue, we propose a novel scalable approach for estimating the robust continuous barycenter, leveraging the dual formulation of the (semi-)unbalanced OT problem. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to develop an algorithm for robust barycenters under the continuous distribution setup. Our method is framed as a min-max optimization problem and is adaptable to general cost functions. We rigorously establish the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness to outliers and class imbalance through a number of illustrative experiments. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/milenagazdieva/U-NOTBarycenters.</description>

      <title>Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampling for multi-modal distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past few years, several approaches utilizing score-based diffusion have been proposed to sample from probability distributions, that is without having access to exact samples and relying solely on evaluations of unnormalized densities. The resulting samplers approximate the time-reversal of a noising diffusion process, bridging the target distribution to an easy-to-sample base distribution. In practice, the performance of these methods heavily depends on key hyperparameters that require ground truth samples to be accurately tuned. Our work aims to highlight and address this fundamental issue, focusing in particular on multi-modal distributions, which pose significant challenges for existing sampling methods. Building on existing approaches, we introduce Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler (LRDS), a methodology specifically designed to leverage prior knowledge on the location of the target modes in order to bypass the obstacle of hyperparameter tuning. LRDS proceeds in two steps by (i) learning a reference diffusion model on samples located in high-density space regions and tailored for multimodality, and (ii) using this reference model to foster the training of a diffusion-based sampler. We experimentally demonstrate that LRDS best exploits prior knowledge on the target distribution compared to competing algorithms on a variety of challenging distributions.</description>

      <title>Towards safe Bayesian optimization with Wiener kernel regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a data-driven strategy for minimizing/maximizing black-box functions based on probabilistic surrogate models. In the presence of safety constraints, the performance of BO crucially relies on tight probabilistic error bounds related to the uncertainty surrounding the surrogate model. For the case of Gaussian Process surrogates and Gaussian measurement noise, we present a novel error bound based on the recently proposed Wiener kernel regression. We prove that under rather mild assumptions, the proposed error bound is tighter than bounds previously documented in the literature, leading to enlarged safety regions. We draw upon a numerical example to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed error bound in safe BO.</description>

      <title>Causal machine learning for heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of missing outcome data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, missing outcome data can complicate treatment effect estimation, causing certain subgroups of the population to be poorly represented. In this work, we discuss this commonly overlooked problem and consider the impact that missing at random (MAR) outcome data has on causal machine learning estimators for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). We propose two de-biased machine learning estimators for the CATE, the mDR-learner and mEP-learner, which address the issue of under-representation by integrating inverse probability of censoring weights into the DR-learner and EP-learner respectively. We show that under reasonable conditions, these estimators are oracle efficient, and illustrate their favorable performance through simulated data settings, comparing them to existing CATE estimators, including comparison to estimators which use common missing data techniques. We present an example of their application using the GBSG2 trial, exploring treatment effect heterogeneity when comparing hormonal therapies to non-hormonal therapies among breast cancer patients post surgery, and offer guidance on the decisions a practitioner must make when implementing these estimators.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Statistical Tests for LLM-Generated Text Detection using Finite Sample Concentration Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. We answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts. We prove that our tests' type I and type II errors decrease exponentially as text length increases. For designing our tests for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by the evaluator model $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in the string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. For our experiments: First, we present experiments using open-source LLMs to support our theoretical results, and then we provide experiments in a black-box setting with adversarial attacks. Practically, our work enables guaranteed finding of the origin of harmful or false LLM-generated text, which can be useful for combating misinformation and compliance with emerging AI regulations.</description>

      <title>Deep Transfer $Q$-Learning for Offline Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dynamic decision-making scenarios across business and healthcare, leveraging sample trajectories from diverse populations can significantly enhance reinforcement learning (RL) performance for specific target populations, especially when sample sizes are limited. While existing transfer learning methods primarily focus on linear regression settings, they lack direct applicability to reinforcement learning algorithms. This paper pioneers the study of transfer learning for dynamic decision scenarios modeled by non-stationary finite-horizon Markov decision processes, utilizing neural networks as powerful function approximators and backward inductive learning. We demonstrate that naive sample pooling strategies, effective in regression settings, fail in Markov decision processes.To address this challenge, we introduce a novel ``re-weighted targeting procedure'' to construct ``transferable RL samples'' and propose ``transfer deep $Q^*$-learning'', enabling neural network approximation with theoretical guarantees. We assume that the reward functions are transferable and deal with both situations in which the transition densities are transferable or nontransferable. Our analytical techniques for transfer learning in neural network approximation and transition density transfers have broader implications, extending to supervised transfer learning with neural networks and domain shift scenarios. Empirical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate the advantages of our method, showcasing its potential for improving decision-making through strategically constructing transferable RL samples in non-stationary reinforcement learning contexts.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing in the Linear Valuation Model using Shape Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a shape-constrained approach to dynamic pricing for censored data in the linear valuation model eliminating the need for tuning parameters commonly required by existing methods. Previous works have addressed the challenge of unknown market noise distribution $F_0$ using strategies ranging from kernel methods to reinforcement learning algorithms, such as bandit techniques and upper confidence bounds (UCB), under the assumption that $F_0$ satisfies Lipschitz (or stronger) conditions. In contrast, our method relies on isotonic regression under the weaker assumption that $F_0$ is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous for some $\alpha \in (0,1]$, for which we derive a regret upper bound. Simulations and experiments with real-world data obtained by Welltower Inc (a major healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust) consistently demonstrate that our method attains lower empirical regret in comparison to several existing methods in the literature while offering the advantage of being tuning-parameter free.</description>

      <title>Practical Evaluation of Copula-based Survival Metrics: Beyond the Independent Censoring Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional survival metrics, such as Harrell's concordance index and the Brier Score, rely on the independent censoring assumption for valid inference in the presence of right-censored data. However, when instances are censored for reasons related to the event of interest, this assumption no longer holds, as this kind of dependent censoring biases the marginal survival estimates of popular nonparametric estimators. In this paper, we propose three copula-based metrics to evaluate survival models in the presence of dependent censoring, and design a framework to create realistic, semi-synthetic datasets with dependent censoring to facilitate the evaluation of the metrics. Our empirical analyses in synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets show that our metrics can give error estimates that are closer to the true error, mainly in terms of prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Diffusion Model in High Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDE, while aligning with the degraded objective function. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</description>

      <title>A Piecewise Lyapunov Analysis of Sub-quadratic SGD: Applications to Robust and Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by robust and quantile regression problems, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for minimizing an objective function $f$ that is locally strongly convex with a sub--quadratic tail. This setting covers many widely used online statistical methods. We introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function that enables us to handle functions $f$ with only first-order differentiability, which includes a wide range of popular loss functions such as Huber loss. Leveraging our proposed Lyapunov function, we derive finite-time moment bounds under general diminishing stepsizes, as well as constant stepsizes. We further establish the weak convergence, central limit theorem and bias characterization under constant stepsize, providing the first geometrical convergence result for sub--quadratic SGD. Our results have wide applications, especially in online statistical methods. In particular, we discuss two applications of our results. 1) Online robust regression: We consider a corrupted linear model with sub--exponential covariates and heavy--tailed noise. Our analysis provides convergence rates comparable to those for corrupted models with Gaussian covariates and noise. 2) Online quantile regression: Importantly, our results relax the common assumption in prior work that the conditional density is continuous and provide a more fine-grained analysis for the moment bounds.</description>

      <title>MIO : Mutual Information Optimization using Self-Supervised Binary Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks have progressed rapidly over the last few years. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function for contrastive learning. We model our pre-training task as a binary classification problem to induce an implicit contrastive effect. We further improve the n\"aive loss function after removing the effect of the positive-positive repulsion and incorporating the upper bound of the negative pair repulsion. Unlike existing methods, the proposed loss function optimizes the mutual information in positive and negative pairs. We also present a closed-form expression for the parameter gradient flow and compare the behaviour of self-supervised contrastive frameworks using Hessian eigenspectrum to analytically study their convergence. The proposed method outperforms SOTA self-supervised contrastive frameworks on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet. After 200 pretraining epochs with ResNet-18 as the backbone, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 86.36%, 58.18%, 80.50%, and 30.87% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, respectively, and surpasses the SOTA contrastive baseline by 1.93%, 3.57%, 4.85%, and 0.33%, respectively. The proposed framework also achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 78.4% (200 epochs) and 65.22% (100 epochs) Top-1 Linear Evaluation accuracy on ImageNet100 and ImageNet1K datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Sparse Movement Speed of Urban Road Networks with Nonstationary Temporal Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movement speed data from urban road networks, computed from ridesharing vehicles or taxi trajectories, is often high-dimensional, sparse, and nonstationary (e.g., exhibiting seasonality). To address these challenges, we propose a Nonstationary Temporal Matrix Factorization (NoTMF) model that leverages matrix factorization to project high-dimensional and sparse movement speed data into low-dimensional latent spaces. This results in a concise formula with the multiplication between spatial and temporal factor matrices. To characterize the temporal correlations, NoTMF takes a latent equation on the seasonal differenced temporal factors using higher-order vector autoregression (VAR). This approach not only preserves the low-rank structure of sparse movement speed data but also maintains consistent temporal dynamics, including seasonality information. The learning process for NoTMF involves optimizing the spatial and temporal factor matrices along with a collection of VAR coefficient matrices. To solve this efficiently, we introduce an alternating minimization framework, which tackles a challenging procedure of estimating the temporal factor matrix using conjugate gradient method, as the subproblem involves both partially observed matrix factorization and seasonal differenced VAR. To evaluate the forecasting performance of NoTMF, we conduct extensive experiments on Uber movement speed datasets, which are estimated from ridesharing vehicle trajectories. These datasets contain a large proportion of missing values due to insufficient ridesharing vehicles on the urban road network. Despite the presence of missing data, NoTMF demonstrates superior forecasting accuracy and effectiveness compared to baseline models. Moreover, as the seasonality of movement speed data is of great concern, the experiment results highlight the significance of addressing the nonstationarity of movement speed data.</description>

      <title>Topology-aware Generalization of Decentralized SGD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12680v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the algorithmic stability and generalizability of decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD). We prove that the consensus model learned by D-SGD is $\mathcal{O}{(N^{-1}+m^{-1} +\lambda^2)}$-stable in expectation in the non-convex non-smooth setting, where $N$ is the total sample size, $m$ is the worker number, and $1+\lambda$ is the spectral gap that measures the connectivity of the communication topology. These results then deliver an $\mathcal{O}{(N^{-(1+\alpha)/2}+ m^{-(1+\alpha)/2}+\lambda^{1+\alpha} + \phi_{\mathcal{S}})}$ in-average generalization bound, which is non-vacuous even when $\lambda$ is closed to $1$, in contrast to vacuous as suggested by existing literature on the projected version of D-SGD. Our theory indicates that the generalizability of D-SGD is positively correlated with the spectral gap, and can explain why consensus control in initial training phase can ensure better generalization. Experiments of VGG-11 and ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet justify our theory. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on the topology-aware generalization of vanilla D-SGD.

      <title>Understanding Best Subset Selection: A Tale of Two C(omplex)ities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of best subset selection (BSS) under high-dimensional sparse linear regression model. Recently, Guo et al. (2020) showed that the model selection performance of BSS depends on a certain identifiability margin, a measure that captures the model discriminative power of BSS under a general correlation structure that is robust to the design dependence, unlike its computational surrogates such as LASSO, SCAD, MCP, etc. Expanding on this, we further broaden the theoretical understanding of best subset selection in this paper and show that the complexities of the residualized signals, the portion of the signals orthogonal to the true active features, and spurious projections, describing the projection operators associated with the irrelevant features, also play fundamental roles in characterizing the margin condition for model consistency of BSS. In particular, we establish both necessary and sufficient margin conditions depending only on the identifiability margin and the two complexity measures. We also partially extend our sufficiency result to the case of high-dimensional sparse generalized linear models (GLMs).</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Stochastic Heavy Ball Method With Approximate Gradients and/or Block Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the convergence of the stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) algorithm under more general conditions than in the current literature. Specifically, (i) The stochastic gradient is permitted to be biased, and also, to have conditional variance that grows over time (or iteration number). This feature is essential when applying SHB with zeroth-order methods, which use only two function evaluations to approximate the gradient. In contrast, all existing papers assume that the stochastic gradient is unbiased and/or has bounded conditional variance. (ii) The step sizes are permitted to be random, which is essential when applying SHB with block updating. The sufficient conditions for convergence are stochastic analogs of the well-known Robbins-Monro conditions. This is in contrast to existing papers where more restrictive conditions are imposed on the step size sequence. (iii) Our analysis embraces not only convex functions, but also more general functions that satisfy the PL (Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz) and KL (Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz) conditions. (iv) If the stochastic gradient is unbiased and has bounded variance, and the objective function satisfies (PL), then the iterations of SHB match the known best rates for convex functions. (v) We establish the almost-sure convergence of the iterations, as opposed to convergence in the mean or convergence in probability, which is the case in much of the literature. (vi) Each of the above convergence results continue to hold if full-coordinate updating is replaced by any one of three widely-used updating methods. In addition, numerical computations are carried out to illustrate the above points.</description>

      <title>Evaluating AI systems under uncertain ground truth: a case study in dermatology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For safety, medical AI systems undergo thorough evaluations before deployment, validating their predictions against a ground truth which is assumed to be fixed and certain. However, this ground truth is often curated in the form of differential diagnoses. While a single differential diagnosis reflects the uncertainty in one expert assessment, multiple experts introduce another layer of uncertainty through disagreement. Both forms of uncertainty are ignored in standard evaluation which aggregates these differential diagnoses to a single label. In this paper, we show that ignoring uncertainty leads to overly optimistic estimates of model performance, therefore underestimating risk associated with particular diagnostic decisions. To this end, we propose a statistical aggregation approach, where we infer a distribution on probabilities of underlying medical condition candidates themselves, based on observed annotations. This formulation naturally accounts for the potential disagreements between different experts, as well as uncertainty stemming from individual differential diagnoses, capturing the entire ground truth uncertainty. Our approach boils down to generating multiple samples of medical condition probabilities, then evaluating and averaging performance metrics based on these sampled probabilities. In skin condition classification, we find that a large portion of the dataset exhibits significant ground truth uncertainty and standard evaluation severely over-estimates performance without providing uncertainty estimates. In contrast, our framework provides uncertainty estimates on common metrics of interest such as top-k accuracy and average overlap, showing that performance can change multiple percentage points. We conclude that, while assuming a crisp ground truth can be acceptable for many AI applications, a more nuanced evaluation protocol should be utilized in medical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Affine Invariance in Continuous-Domain Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of group invariance helps neural networks in recognizing patterns and features under geometric transformations. Group convolutional neural networks enhance traditional convolutional neural networks by incorporating group-based geometric structures into their design. This research studies affine invariance on continuous-domain convolutional neural networks. Despite other research considering isometric invariance or similarity invariance, we focus on the full structure of affine transforms generated by the group of all invertible $2 \times 2$ real matrices (generalized linear group $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$). We introduce a new criterion to assess the invariance of two signals under affine transformations. The input image is embedded into the affine Lie group $G_2 = \mathbb{R}^2 \ltimes \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ to facilitate group convolution operations that respect affine invariance. Then, we analyze the convolution of embedded signals over $G_2$. In sum, our research could eventually extend the scope of geometrical transformations that usual deep-learning pipelines can handle.</description>

      <title>Extremal graphical modeling with latent variables via convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extremal graphical models encode the conditional independence structure of multivariate extremes and provide a powerful tool for quantifying the risk of rare events. Prior work on learning these graphs from data has focused on the setting where all relevant variables are observed. For the popular class of H\"usler-Reiss models, we propose the \texttt{eglatent} method, a tractable convex program for learning extremal graphical models in the presence of latent variables. Our approach decomposes the H\"usler-Reiss precision matrix into a sparse component encoding the graphical structure among the observed variables after conditioning on the latent variables, and a low-rank component encoding the effect of a few latent variables on the observed variables. We provide finite-sample guarantees of \texttt{eglatent} and show that it consistently recovers the conditional graph as well as the number of latent variables. We highlight the improved performances of our approach on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although theoretically compelling, Bayesian learning with modern machine learning models is computationally challenging since it requires approximating a high dimensional posterior distribution. In this work, we (i) introduce posteriors, an easily extensible PyTorch library hosting general-purpose implementations making Bayesian learning accessible and scalable to large data and parameter regimes; (ii) present a tempered framing of stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo, as implemented in posteriors, that transitions seamlessly into optimization and unveils a minor modification to deep ensembles to ensure they are asymptotically unbiased for the Bayesian posterior, and (iii) demonstrate and compare the utility of Bayesian approximations through experiments including an investigation into the cold posterior effect and applications with large language models.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the denoising diffusion probabilistic models for general noise schedules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01320v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical analysis of the original formulation of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), introduced by Ho, Jain, and Abbeel in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33 (2020), pp. 6840-6851. An explicit upper bound is derived for the total variation distance between the distribution of the discrete-time DDPM sampling algorithm and a target data distribution, under general noise schedule parameters. The analysis assumes certain technical conditions on the data distribution and a linear growth condition on the noise estimation function. The sampling sequence emerges as an exponential integrator-type approximation of a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) over a finite time interval. Schr\"odinger's problem provides a tool for estimating the distributional error in reverse time, which connects the reverse-time error with its forward-time counterpart. The score function in DDPMs appears as an adapted solution of a forward-backward SDE, providing a foundation for analyzing the time-discretization error associated with the reverse-time SDE.</description>

      <title>Self-Improving Robust Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online and offline RLHF methods, such as PPO and DPO, have been highly successful in aligning AI with human preferences. Despite their success, however, these methods suffer from fundamental limitations: (a) Models trained with RLHF can learn from mistakes or negative examples through RL mechanism or contrastive loss during training. However, at inference time, they lack an innate self-improvement mechanism for error corrections. (b) The optimal solution of existing methods is highly task-dependent, making it difficult for them to generalize to new tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Improving Robust Preference Optimization (SRPO), a practical and mathematically principled offline RLHF framework. The key idea behind SRPO is to cast the problem of learning from human preferences as a self-improvement process, mathematically formulated as a min-max objective that jointly optimizes a self-improvement policy and a generative policy in an adversarial fashion. Crucially, the solution for this optimization problem is independent of the training task, which makes it robust to its changes. We then show that this objective can be reformulated as a non-adversarial offline loss, which can be efficiently optimized using standard supervised learning techniques at scale. To demonstrate SRPO's effectiveness, we evaluate it using AI Win-Rate (WR) against human (GOLD) completions. When tested on the XSum dataset, SRPO outperforms DPO by a margin of 15% after 5 self revisions, achieving an impressive 90% WR. Moreover, on the challenging Arena-Hard prompts, SRPO outperforms both DPO and IPO (by 4% without revision and 6% after a single revision), reaching a 56% WR against against Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.</description>

      <title>Adaptive teachers for amortized samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amortized inference is the task of training a parametric model, such as a neural network, to approximate a distribution with a given unnormalized density where exact sampling is intractable. When sampling is implemented as a sequential decision-making process, reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as generative flow networks, can be used to train the sampling policy. Off-policy RL training facilitates the discovery of diverse, high-reward candidates, but existing methods still face challenges in efficient exploration. We propose to use an adaptive training distribution (the \teacher) to guide the training of the primary amortized sampler (the \student). The \teacher, an auxiliary behavior model, is trained to sample high-loss regions of the \student and can generalize across unexplored modes, thereby enhancing mode coverage by providing an efficient training curriculum. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in a synthetic environment designed to present an exploration challenge, two diffusion-based sampling tasks, and four biochemical discovery tasks demonstrating its ability to improve sample efficiency and mode coverage.

      <title>Convergence of Score-Based Discrete Diffusion Models: A Discrete-Time Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved great success in generating high-dimensional samples across various applications. While the theoretical guarantees for continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied, the convergence analysis of the discrete-state counterparts remains under-explored. In this paper, we study the theoretical aspects of score-based discrete diffusion models under the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) framework. We introduce a discrete-time sampling algorithm in the general state space $[S]^d$ that utilizes score estimators at predefined time points. We derive convergence bounds for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and total variation (TV) distance between the generated sample distribution and the data distribution, considering both scenarios with and without early stopping under reasonable assumptions. Notably, our KL divergence bounds are nearly linear in the dimension $d$, aligning with state-of-the-art results for diffusion models. Our convergence analysis employs a Girsanov-based method and establishes key properties of the discrete score function, which are essential for characterizing the discrete-time sampling process.</description>

      <title>Implicit High-Order Moment Tensor Estimation and Learning Latent Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning latent-variable models. A common algorithmic technique for this task is the method of moments. Unfortunately, moment-based approaches are hampered by the fact that the moment tensors of super-constant degree cannot even be written down in polynomial time. Motivated by such learning applications, we develop a general efficient algorithm for {\em implicit moment tensor computation}. Our framework generalizes the work of~\cite{LL21-opt} which developed an efficient algorithm for the specific moment tensors that arise in clustering mixtures of spherical Gaussians.
  By leveraging our implicit moment estimation algorithm, we obtain the first $\mathrm{poly}(d, k)$-time learning algorithms for the following models.
  * {\bf Mixtures of Linear Regressions} We give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithm for this task, where $\epsilon$ is the desired error.
  * {\bf Mixtures of Spherical Gaussians} For density estimation, we give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time learning algorithm, where $\epsilon$ is the desired total variation error, under the condition that the means lie in a ball of radius $O(\sqrt{\log k})$. For parameter estimation, we give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithm under the {\em optimal} mean separation of $\Omega(\log^{1/2}(k/\epsilon))$.
  * {\bf Positive Linear Combinations of Non-Linear Activations} We give a general algorithm for this task with complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d, k) g(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired error and the function $g$ depends on the Hermite concentration of the target class of functions. Specifically, for positive linear combinations of ReLU activations, our algorithm has complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d, k) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)}$.</description>

      <title>Improving Decoupled Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems using Data Consistency Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performances in solving inverse problems through posterior sampling while they suffer from errors during earlier steps. To mitigate this issue, several Decoupled Posterior Sampling methods have been recently proposed. However, the reverse process in these methods ignores measurement information, leading to errors that impede effective optimization in subsequent steps. To solve this problem, we propose Guided Decoupled Posterior Sampling (GDPS) by integrating a data consistency constraint in the reverse process. The constraint performs a smoother transition within the optimization process, facilitating a more effective convergence toward the target distribution. Furthermore, we extend our method to latent diffusion models and Tweedie's formula, demonstrating its scalability. We evaluate GDPS on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets across various linear and nonlinear tasks under both standard and challenging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that GDPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Partially Linear Transformation Model for Right-Censored Survival Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the Cox proportional hazards model is well established and extensively used in the analysis of survival data, the proportional hazards (PH) assumption may not always hold in practical scenarios. The semiparametric transformation model extends the conventional Cox model and also includes many other survival models as special cases. This paper introduces a deep partially linear transformation model (DPLTM) as a general and flexible framework for estimation, inference and prediction. The proposed method is capable of avoiding the curse of dimensionality while still retaining the interpretability of some covariates of interest. We derive the overall convergence rate of the maximum likelihood estimators, the minimax lower bound of the nonparametric deep neural network (DNN) estimator, the asymptotic normality and the semiparametric efficiency of the parametric estimator. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the impressive performance of the proposed estimation procedure in terms of both estimation accuracy and prediction power, which is further validated by an application to a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Ask for More Than Bayes Optimal: A Theory of Indecisions for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selective classification is a powerful tool for automated decision-making in high-risk scenarios, allowing classifiers to make only highly confident decisions while abstaining when uncertainty is too high. Given a target classification accuracy, our goal is to minimize the number of indecisions, which are observations that we do not automate. For problems that are hard, the target accuracy may not be achievable without using indecisions. In contrast, by using indecisions, we are able to control the misclassification rate to any user-specified level, even below the Bayes optimal error rate, while minimizing the frequency of identifying an indecision. We provide a full characterization of the minimax risk in selective classification, proving key continuity and monotonicity properties that enable optimal indecision selection. Our results extend to hypothesis testing, where we control type II error given a fixed type I error, introducing a novel perspective in selective inference. We analyze the impact of estimating the regression function $\eta$, showing that plug-in classifiers remain consistent and that accuracy-based calibration effectively controls indecision levels. Additionally, we develop finite-sample calibration methods and identify cases where no training data is needed under the Monotone Likelihood Ratio (MLR) property. In the binary Gaussian mixture model, we establish sharp phase transition results, demonstrating that minimal indecisions can yield near-optimal accuracy even with suboptimal class separation. These findings highlight the potential of selective classification to significantly reduce misclassification rates with a relatively small cost in terms of indecisions.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies are Virtue: Weak-to-Strong Generalization through Lens of Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization is a type of finetuning (FT) where a strong (large) student model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by a weak teacher. Surprisingly, W2S FT often outperforms the weak teacher. We seek to understand this phenomenon through the observation that FT often occurs in intrinsically low-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of FT, we analyze W2S in the ridgeless regression setting from a variance reduction perspective. For a strong student - weak teacher pair with sufficiently expressive low-dimensional feature subspaces $\mathcal{V}_s, \mathcal{V}_w$, we provide an exact characterization of the variance that dominates the generalization error of W2S. This unveils a virtue of discrepancy between the strong and weak models in W2S: the variance of the weak teacher is inherited by the strong student in $\mathcal{V}_s \cap \mathcal{V}_w$, while reduced by a factor of $\dim(\mathcal{V}_s)/N$ in the subspace of discrepancy $\mathcal{V}_w \setminus \mathcal{V}_s$ with $N$ pseudo-labels for W2S. Further, our analysis casts light on the sample complexities and the scaling of performance gap recovery in W2S. The analysis is supported with experiments on synthetic regression and real vision and NLP tasks.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Robust Covariance and Scatter Matrix Estimation Beyond Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of computationally efficient robust estimation of the covariance/scatter matrix of elliptical distributions -- that is, affine transformations of spherically symmetric distributions -- under the strong contamination model in the high-dimensional regime $d \gtrsim 1/\varepsilon^2$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\varepsilon$ is the fraction of adversarial corruptions.
  We propose an algorithm that, under a very mild assumption on the scatter matrix $\Sigma$, and given a nearly optimal number of samples $n = \tilde{O}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$, computes in polynomial time an estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ such that, with high probability, \[ \left\| \Sigma^{-1/2} \hat{\Sigma} \Sigma^{-1/2} - Id \right\|_{\text F} \le O(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))\,. \]
  As an application of our result, we obtain the first efficiently computable, nearly optimal robust covariance estimators that extend beyond the Gaussian case. Specifically, for elliptical distributions satisfying the Hanson--Wright inequality (such as Gaussians and uniform distributions over ellipsoids), our estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ of the covariance $\Sigma$ achieves the same error guarantee as in the Gaussian case. Moreover, for elliptical distributions with sub-exponential tails (such as the multivariate Laplace distribution), we construct an estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ satisfying the spectral norm bound \[ \left\| \Sigma^{-1/2} \hat{\Sigma} \Sigma^{-1/2} - Id \right\| \le O(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))\,. \]
  Our approach is based on estimating the covariance of the spatial sign of elliptical distributions. The estimation proceeds in several stages, one of which involves a novel spectral covariance filtering algorithm. This algorithm combines covariance filtering techniques with degree-4 sum-of-squares relaxations, and we believe it may be of independent interest for future applications.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Memory for Online Interdomain Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel online Gaussian process (GP) model that is capable of capturing long-term memory in sequential data in an online regression setting. Our model, Online HiPPO Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Regression (OHSGPR), leverages the HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) framework, which is popularized in the RNN domain due to its long-range memory modeling capabilities. We interpret the HiPPO time-varying orthogonal projections as inducing variables with time-dependent orthogonal polynomial basis functions, which allows the SGPR inducing points to memorize the process history. We show that the HiPPO framework fits naturally into the interdomain GP framework and demonstrate that the kernel matrices can also be updated online in a recurrence form based on the ODE evolution of HiPPO. We evaluate our method on time series regression tasks, showing that it outperforms the existing online GP method in terms of predictive performance and computational efficiency</description>

      <title>Robust Learning of Multi-index Models via Iterative Subspace Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning Multi-Index Models (MIMs) with label noise under the Gaussian distribution. A $K$-MIM is any function $f$ that only depends on a $K$-dimensional subspace. We focus on well-behaved MIMs with finite ranges that satisfy certain regularity properties. Our main contribution is a general robust learner that is qualitatively optimal in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Our algorithm iteratively constructs better approximations to the defining subspace by computing low-degree moments conditional on the projection to the subspace computed thus far, and adding directions with relatively large empirical moments. This procedure efficiently finds a subspace $V$ so that $f(\mathbf{x})$ is close to a function of the projection of $\mathbf{x}$ onto $V$. Conversely, for functions for which these conditional moments do not help, we prove an SQ lower bound suggesting that no efficient learner exists. As applications, we provide faster robust learners for the following concept classes:
  * {\bf Multiclass Linear Classifiers} We give a constant-factor approximate agnostic learner with sample complexity $N = O(d) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first constant-factor agnostic learner for this class whose complexity is a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  * {\bf Intersections of Halfspaces} We give an approximate agnostic learner for this class achieving 0-1 error $K \tilde{O}(\mathrm{OPT}) + \epsilon$ with sample complexity $N=O(d^2) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first agnostic learner for this class with near-linear error dependence and complexity a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  Furthermore, we show that in the presence of random classification noise, the complexity of our algorithm scales polynomially with $1/\epsilon$.</description>
