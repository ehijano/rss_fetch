      <title>Anyon superfluid in trilayer quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intertwining intrinsic topological order with gapless collective modes remains a central challenge in many-body physics. We show that a quantum-Hall trilayer at $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\nu_{3}= \frac13$, tuned solely by the inter-layer spacing $d$, realizes this goal. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations and a Chern-Simons field theory analysis reveal an intermediate ``anyon-exciton condensate'' separating the familiar $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=1$ exciton condensate ($d \to 0$) from three decoupled Laughlin liquids ($d \to \infty$). In this phase, neutral bi-excitons condense while a $\nu=\frac23$ Laughlin topological order survives, yielding a Goldstone mode coexisting with fractionalized anyons. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis maps out the finite-temperature phase diagram. The anyon-exciton condensate can be experimentally verified through a vanishing double-counter-flow resistance and a fractional layer-resolved Hall resistivity $R_{xy}=\frac{5}{2} h/e^{2}$, both within reach of existing high-mobility trilayer devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mean field theory with quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-term quantum processors are limited in terms of the number of qubits and gates they can afford. They nevertheless give unprecedented access to programmable quantum systems that can efficiently, although imperfectly, simulate quantum time evolutions. Dynamical mean field theory, on the other hand, maps strongly-correlated lattice models like the Hubbard model onto simpler, yet still many-body models called impurity models. Its computational bottleneck boils down to investigating the dynamics of the impurity upon addition or removal of one particle. This task is notoriously difficult for classical algorithms, which has warranted the development of specific classical algorithms called "impurity solvers" that work well in some regimes, but still struggle to reach some parameter regimes. In these lecture notes, we introduce the tools and methods of quantum computing that could be used to overcome the limitations of these classical impurity solvers, either in the long term -- with fully quantum algorithms, or in the short term -- with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation reflecting the sub-cycle evolution of the Mott transition under a mid-infrared electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solids in an intense laser field show high-harmonic generation (HHG), which can provide information on carrier dynamics and band structures in weakly correlated systems. In strongly correlated systems, a laser field can induce a transition between the various electronic phases formed by the entanglement of charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom via carrier generation. The HHG accompanying this process should contain information on the nonequilibrium electronic-state dynamics along the oscillating field - an aspect that remains unresolved to date. Here, we show that an intense mid-infrared (MIR) pulse induces a Mott insulator-metal transition in a one-dimensional cuprate, Sr2CuO3, the evolution of which is reflected by the spectral features of HHs. When the electric-field amplitude exceeds 6 MV/cm, carriers are efficiently generated and each harmonic frequency decreases from odd multiples of the MIR frequency. Dynamical mean-field theory indicates that these redshifts originate from a series of electronic-structure reconstructions in each electric-field cycle during the melting of the Mott-insulator state, which modifies the radiation phase from carrier recombination cycle-by-cycle. This phenomenon is negligible in rigid-band systems. This experimental-theoretical study confirms that HH spectroscopy research can potentially unravel the sub-cycle dynamics of nonequilibrium phase transitions in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Phenomena in Condensed Matter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry, which describes the geometry of Bloch wavefunctions in solids, has become a cornerstone of modern quantum condensed matter physics. The quantum geometrical tensor encodes this geometry through two fundamental components: the quantum metric (real part) and the Berry curvature (imaginary part). While the Berry curvature gained prominence through its manifestation in the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, recent advances have revealed equally significant effects arising from the quantum metric. This includes its signatures in nonlinear transport, superfluid density of flat-band superconductors, and nonlinear optical responses. These advances underscore how quantum geometry is reshaping our understanding of condensed matter systems, with far-reaching implications for future technologies. In this review, we survey recent progress in the field, focusing on both foundational concepts and emergent phenomena in transport and optics-with particular emphasis on the pivotal role of the quantum metric.</description>

      <title>Electronic properties of Kagome metal YbV$_3$Sb$_4$: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the vanadium-based Kagome metal YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the Wannier function analysis. We explore the electronic properties, de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect and Fermi surface. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling SOC induces the splitting of Yb-4f states, while its impact on the V-3d states is moderate. Furthermore, we have incorporated SOC+U, where U being the Hubbard parameter, which drastically changes the Yb-4f states creating additional splitting leading to three distinct peaks in the density of states (DOS). The V-3d atoms with the Kagome lattice contribute maximum to the transport properties, exhibits flat bands near the EF while being protected under SOC and U+SOC. Herein, we report the vulnerability of the Yb-4f states under SOC and U+SOC. Furthurmore, The Fermi surface is found to comprise of quasi-2D cylindrical sheets centered at the Gamma-point, along with smaller pockets near the Brillouin zone boundaries, which under combined U+SOC, a small spherical pocket emerges and the cylindrical sheet exhibits slight deformations. The dHvA frequencies reach as high as 70 kilotesla, which increase with tilt angle, exhibiting a nearly parabolic trend as expected for cylindrical orbits, while a low-frequency branch remains below 1 kT. Only the U+SOC case shows noticeable modification in both the Fermi surface and the dHvA oscillation. Crucially, the $Z_2$ invariant calculation identifies YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ as a strong topological metal ($r_0 = 1$). These findings not only advance our understanding of the underlying quantum phenomena in rare-earth Kagome systems, but also establish YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ as a compelling and promising platform for exploring intertwined topology and electron correlations in kagome lattices, thereby offering valuable insights for engineering quantum phases in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement spreading and emergent locality in Brownian SYK chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula and its interpretation in terms of quantum error correction (QEC) implies an emergent locality for the spread of quantum information in holographic CFTs, where information injected at a point in the boundary theory spreads within a sharp light-cone corresponding to the butterfly velocity. This emergent locality is a necessary condition for the existence of a geometric bulk dual with an RT-like formula for entanglement entropy. In this paper, we use tools from QEC to study the spread of quantum information and the emergence of a sharp light-cone in an analytically tractable model of chaotic dynamics, namely a one-dimensional Brownian SYK chain. We start with an infinite temperature state in this model and inject a qudit at time $t=0$ at some point $p$ on the chain. We then explicitly calculate the amount of information of the qudit contained in an interval of length $2\ell$ (centered around $p$) at some later time $t=T$. We find that at strong coupling, this quantity shows a sharp transition as a function of $\ell$ from near zero to near maximal correlation. The transition occurs at $\ell \sim v_B T$, with $v_B$ being the butterfly velocity. Underlying the emergence of this sharp light-cone is a non-linear generalization of the diffusion equation called the FKPP equation, which admits sharp domain wall solutions at late times and strong coupling. These domain wall solutions can be understood on physical grounds from properties of operator growth in chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Fermi's Golden Rule in 1d systems at non-zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In interacting quantum systems, the single-particle Green's function is expected to decay in time due to the interaction induced decoherence of quasiparticles. In the limit of weak interaction strengths ($\Delta$), a naive application of Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) predicts an $\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{2})$ quasiparticle decay rate. However, for 1d fermions on the lattice at $T&gt;0$, this calculation gives a divergent result and the scaling of the quasiparticle lifetime with interaction strength remains an open question. In this work we propose a solution to this question: combining numerical simulations using the recently introduced dissipation-assisted operator evolution (DAOE) method, with non-perturbative diagrammatic re-summations, we predict a logarithmic enhancement of the quasiparticle decay rate $\tau^{-1} \sim \Delta^{2} \log \Delta^{-2}$. We argue that this effect is present in a wide variety of well-known weakly interacting quantum fermionic and bosonic systems, and even in some classical systems, provided the non-interacting limit has quasiparticles with a generic dispersion.</description>

      <title>Uniform electronic states and $s$-wave superconductivity in a strongly disordered high-entropy compound (RuRhPdIr)$_{0.6}$Pt$_{0.4}$Sb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy compounds, where multiple elements occupy a single crystallographic site in a highly disordered manner, challenge conventional understandings of electronic structure based on periodicity and well-defined band dispersion. Here, we report a detailed nuclear magnetic resonance study of the high-entropy superconductor (RuRhPdIr)$_{0.6}$Pt$_{0.4}$Sb, revealing a spatially homogeneous electronic environment in the normal state, in stark contrast to its crystallographically disordered lattice. The superconducting state exhibits a small but solid Hebel-Slichter coherence peak followed by a significant decrease in the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, providing compelling evidence for fully gapped $s$-wave pairing. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of superconductivity in highly disordered quantum materials but also open a new pathway for exploring novel superconducting states in entropy-stabilized systems.</description>

      <title>The effect of dephasing and spin-lattice relaxation during the switching processes in quantum antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of antiferromagnetic order can pave the way to large storage capacity as well as fast manipulation of stored data. Here achieving a steady-state of sublattice magnetization after switching is crucial to prevent loss of stored data. The present theoretical approach aims to obtain instantaneous stable states of the order after reorienting the N\'eel vector in open quantum antiferromagnets using time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory. The Lindblad formalism is employed to couple the system to the environment. The quantum theoretical approach comprises differences in the effects of dephasing, originating from destructive interference of different wave vectors, and spin-lattice relaxation. We show that the spin-lattice relaxation results in an exponentially fast convergence to the steady-state after full ultrafast switching.</description>

      <title>Gapless superconductivity from extremely dilute magnetic disorder in 2H-NbSe2-xSx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most superconducting materials exhibit a vanishing density of states at the Fermi level and Anderson's theorem posits that the superconducting gap is robust against nonmagnetic disorder. Although dilute magnetic impurities lead to localized in-gap states, these states typically have no bearing on the material's bulk superconducting properties. However, numerous experiments reveal a finite density of states at the Fermi level in systems with an apparently negligible number of magnetic impurities. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy and self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations, we find that gapless superconductivity emerges in 2H-NbSe2-xSx at remarkably low magnetic impurity concentrations. Furthermore, our density functional theory calculations and in-gap quasiparticle interference measurements demonstrate that the Se-S substitution significantly modifies the band structure. This modification favours nesting and dictates the in-gap scattering for x&gt;0, in stark contrast to the dominant charge density wave interactions in pure 2H-NbSe2. Our findings reveal an unusual superconducting response to disorder and highlight the importance of incorporating material-specific band structures in the understanding of a superconductor's response to even very low concentrations of magnetic impurities.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to WSMs, but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a bipartite quantum system through the lens of quantum thermodynamics in the absence of conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider the long-range Kitaev model, where the pairing interaction decays as a power law with exponent $\alpha$, with broken conformal symmetry for $\alpha&lt;3/2$. We analytically show that the bound energy, a quantum thermodynamical quantity, is linearly proportional to the square of entanglement entropy per unit system size for $\alpha=1$ where conformal symmetry is broken. We further show that for all values of $\alpha$, bound energy, in the thermodynamic limit, shows a pronounced minimum at the critical point, which enables the identification of $\mu=1$.</description>

      <title>Angular Dependence of Specific Heat and Magnetization Effects in the Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the Kitaev model using the equation of motion approach for the spin Green's function, considering both the case of suppressed magnetization ($m = 0$) and finite magnetization ($m \neq 0$). When magnetization is suppressed, the specific heat exhibits a clear 60^\circ$ periodicity in its angular dependence, with the locations of maxima and minima consistent with recent experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. A qualitative difference in their temperature dependence is observed: the minima show gap-like behavior that may signal Majorana gap formation due to time-reversal symmetry breaking, while the maxima do not exhibit the expected gapless Majorana fermion signature. In addition, a linear-in-field effect -- distinct from magnetization -- emerges, with the characteristic temperature below which angular dependence appears increasing linearly with the magnetic field. Importantly, this directional dependence becomes quantitatively significant only at very low temperatures. When finite magnetization is included, the angular dependence of the specific heat remains, and the qualitative behavior is similar to the $m = 0$ case: the minima continue to exhibit gap-like features, while the maxima do not show signatures of gapless Majorana fermions. These results suggest that suppressing magnetization alone is insufficient to realize quantum spin liquid behavior in the Kitaev model under a magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic phase, has spurred growing research activity. Studies from a perspective of dynamical electronic correlation still remain scarce. Employing density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) that incorporates dynamical electronic correlation, we demonstrate that CaCrO$_3$ is a strongly correlated altermagnet. Our DFT+DMFT calculations successfully reproduce the correlated metallic behavior of CaCrO$_3$ and quantitatively capture the incoherent state observed experimentally. We also identify that the altermagnetic CaCrO$_3$ is a Hund's metal. The incoherent state is attributed to Hund's coupling, which gives rise to a non-Fermi liquid behavior. Moreover, we find that altermagnetism can induce flat bands, and these incipient flat bands are further promoted by the strong renormalization from Hundness, which further drives a heavy-fermion behavior. Hence, we establish CaCrO$_3$ as a strongly correlated altermagnet and propose that Hund's metals provide an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between electronic correlation and altermagnetism. Our work will promote the study of strongly correlated altermagnetism physics.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian parameter inference from RIXS spectra with active learning</title>

Abstract: Identifying model Hamiltonians is a vital step toward creating predictive models of materials. Here, we combine Bayesian optimization with the EDRIXS numerical package to infer Hamiltonian parameters from resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra within the single atom approximation. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, we test it on experimental RIXS spectra of NiPS3, NiCl2, Ca3LiOsO6, and Fe2O3, and demonstrate that it can reproduce results obtained from hand-fitted parameters to a precision similar to expert human analysis while providing a more systematic mapping of parameter space. Our work provides a key first step toward solving the inverse scattering problem to extract effective multi-orbital models from information-dense RIXS measurements, which can be applied to a host of quantum materials. We also propose atomic model parameter sets for two materials, Ca3LiOsO6 and Fe2O3, that were previously missing from the literature.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization Study on Avalanches in Many-Body Localized Constrained Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Avalanches are believed to be the mechanism behind the transition from many-body localization to the thermal phase. We utilize spin chains with constraints to study the physics of quantum avalanches by exact diagonalization of disordered systems coupled to a thermal bath. Single-spin observables are used to characterize localization and quantify the influence of the thermal bath on disordered spin chains. Constraints on the Hilbert space confine the dynamics to a subspace, effectively reducing the Hilbert space dimension and enabling the study of larger systems with limited computational resources. We study the PXP model, and in addition, we construct spin chains with constraints by searching for constraints with a genetic algorithm to reach larger system sizes. We define quantities to measure the strength of avalanches and use these to compare different models. We find that avalanches are more pronounced in models with constraints compared to those without constraints. Results from exact diagonalization are compared with those from studying the Lindblad master equation. We also identify models that exhibit no thermal phases and find stable ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <title>Collapse of density wave and emergence of superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ evidenced by ultrafast spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05176</link>

Abstract: Recent discoveries of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates realize a rare category of superconductors. However, the use of high-pressure diamond anvil cells limits spectroscopic characterization of the density waves and superconducting gaps. Here, we systematically studied the pressure evolution of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. We found that the transition temperature and energy gap of density waves are suppressed with increasing pressure and disappear suddenly near 17 GPa where structural transition appears. In addition, the observation of a single density wave gap indicates that the spin density wave and charge density wave remain coupled as pressure increases, rather than decoupling. After the density wave collapse, a distinct low-temperature regime emerges, characterized by a small gap consistent with potential superconducting pairing. The separated phase region of superconductivity and density waves suggests that superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ competes strongly with density waves, offering new insights into the interplay between these two phenomena.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Transmutation and Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a situation where a global symmetry of the ultraviolet (UV) theory does not act faithfully on the local infrared (IR) degrees of freedom, but instead acts effectively as a higher-form symmetry. We refer to this phenomenon as symmetry transmutation, where the UV symmetry is "transmuted" into a higher-form symmetry in the IR. Notably, unlike emergent (accidental) symmetries, which are approximate, these symmetries are exact. We illustrate the ubiquity of this phenomenon in various continuum and lattice systems and provide examples where the 't Hooft anomalies of the UV symmetry are matched by those of the new higher-form symmetry in the IR. We also show that in certain phases and for certain energies, the UV baryon-number symmetry of one-flavor QCD is transmuted into a discrete one-form global symmetry. Finally, we compare our symmetry transmutation to the well-known phenomenon of symmetry fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium transport through an interacting monitored quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between strong correlations and Markovian dephasing, resulting from monitoring the charge or spin degrees of freedom of a quantum dot described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model. Using the Auxiliary master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics. Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.</description>
