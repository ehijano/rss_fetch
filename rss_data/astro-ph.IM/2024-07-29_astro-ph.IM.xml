      <title>Feasibility study of upper atmosphere density measurement on the ISS by observations of the CXB transmitted through the Earth rim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the upper atmosphere at ~100 km are important to investigate climate change, space weather forecasting, and the interaction between the Sun and the Earth. Atmospheric occultations of cosmic X-ray sources are an effective technique to measure the neutral density in the upper atmosphere. We are developing the instrument SUIM dedicated to continuous observations of atmospheric occultations. SUIM will be mounted on a platform on the exterior of the International Space Station for six months and pointed at the Earth's rim to observe atmospheric absorption of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB). In this paper, we conducted a feasibility study of SUIM by estimating the CXB statistics and the fraction of the non-X-ray background (NXB) in the observed data. The estimated CXB statistics are enough to evaluate the atmospheric absorption of CXB for every 15 km of altitude. On the other hand, the NXB will be dominant in the X-ray spectra of SUIM. Assuming that the NXB per detection area of SUIM is comparable to that of the soft X-ray Imager onboard Hitomi, the NXB level will be much higher than the CXB one and account for ~80% of the total SUIM spectra.</description>

      <title>The foundation of "Saint V{\'e}ran-Paul Felenbok" astronomical observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the memory of Paul Felenbok (1936-2020) who was astronomer at Paris-Meudon observatory, and founded in 1974, fifty years ago, a high altitude station (2930 m), above Saint V{\'e}ran village in the southern Alps (Queyras). It was initially devoted to the study of the solar corona. Following solar eclipses (1970, 1973) observed with the Lallemand electronic camera, the main goal was to detect with this sensitive detector the structures of the far and hot corona in forbidden lines, using either narrow bandpass filters or spectroscopy. But everything had to be done prior to observations: a track, a house for astronomers, a dome and a complex instrument. We summarize here this fantastic adventure, which was partly successful in terms of scientific results and had to stop in 1982; however, the activity of the station resumed after 1989 under the auspices of the ``AstroQueyras'' association, which replaced the coronagraph by a 62 cm night telescope from Haute Provence observatory; the station extended later with two 50 cm telescopes, was rebuilt in 2015 and received the visit of thousands of amateurs.</description>

      <title>GERry: A Code to Optimise the Hunt for the Electromagnetic Counter-parts to Gravitational Wave Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18642v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for the electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) events has been rapidly gathering pace in recent years thanks to the increasing number and capabilities of both gravitational wave detectors and wide field survey telescopes. Difficulties remain, however, in detecting these counterparts due to their inherent scarcity, faintness and rapidly evolving nature. To find these counterparts, it is important that one optimises the observing strategy for their recovery. This can be difficult due to the large number of potential variables at play. Such follow-up campaigns are also capable of detecting hundreds or potentially thousands of unrelated transients, particularly for GW events with poor localisation. Even if the observations are capable of detecting a counterpart, finding it among the numerous contaminants can prove challenging. Here we present the Gravitational wave Electromagnetic RecovRY code (GERry) to perform detailed analysis and survey-agnostic quantification of observing campaigns attempting to recover electromagnetic counterparts. GERry considers the campaign's spatial, temporal and wavelength coverage, in addition to Galactic extinction and the expected counterpart light curve evolution from the GW 3D localisation volume. It returns quantified statistics that can be used to: determine the probability of having detected the counterpart, identify the most promising sources, and assess and refine strategy. Here we demonstrate the code to look at the performance and parameter space probed by current and upcoming wide-field surveys such as GOTO &amp; VRO.</description>

      <title>Quantifying energy fluence and its uncertainty for radio emission from particle cascades in the presence of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18654v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of radio signals induced by an astroparticle generating a cascade present a challenge because they are always superposed with an irreducible noise contribution. Quantifying these signals constitutes a non-trivial task, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Because of the randomness of the noise phase, the measurements can be either a constructive or a destructive superposition of signal and noise. To recover the electromagnetic energy of the cascade from the radio measurements, the energy fluence, i.e. the time integral of the Poynting vector, has to be estimated. Conventionally, noise subtraction in the time domain has been employed for energy fluence reconstruction, yielding significant biases, including even non-physical and negative values. To mitigate the effect of this bias, usually an SNR threshold cut is imposed, at the expense of excluding valuable data from the analyses. Additionally, the uncertainties derived from the conventional method are underestimated, even for large SNR values. This work tackles these challenges by detailing a method to correctly estimate the uncertainties and lower the reconstruction bias in quantifying radio signals, thereby, ideally, eliminating the need for an SNR cut. The development of the method is based on a robust theoretical and statistical background, and the estimation of the fluence is performed in the frequency domain, allowing for the improvement of further analyses by providing access to frequency-dependent fluence estimation.</description>

      <title>Parameterization of the frequency spectrum of radio emission in the 30-80 MHz band from inclined air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To exploit the wealth of information carried by the short transient radio pulses from air showers, the frequency spectra of the signals have to be investigated. Here, we study the spectral content of radio signals produced by inclined showers, with a focus on the 30-80 MHz frequency band, as measured, for example, by the antennas of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Two exponential models are investigated and used to describe the spectral shape of the Geomagnetic and Charge-excess components of the pulses. The spectral fitting procedure of the models is described in detail. For both components, a parameterization of the frequency slope as a function of the lateral distance to the shower axis and the geometrical distance between core and shower maximum is derived. For the Geomagnetic component, a quadratic correction to the frequency slope is needed to better describe the spectrum, and it has been parameterized, too. These pieces of information can be employed in event reconstruction to constrain the geometry, in particular the core position.</description>

      <title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Wavefront Control for Exoplanet Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet imaging uses coronagraphs to block out the bright light from a star, allowing astronomers to observe the much fainter light from planets orbiting the star. However, these instruments are heavily impacted by small wavefront aberrations and require the minimization of starlight residuals directly in the focal plane. State-of-the art wavefront control methods suffer from errors in the underlying physical models, and often require several iterations to minimize the intensity in the dark hole, limiting performance and reducing effective observation time. This study aims at developing a data-driven method to create a dark hole in post-coronagraphic images. For this purpose, we leverage the model-free capabilities of reinforcement learning to train an agent to learn a control strategy directly from phase diversity images acquired around the focal plane. Initial findings demonstrate successful aberration correction in non-coronagraphic simulations and promising results for dark hole creation in post-coronagraphic scenarios. These results highlight the potential of model-free reinforcement learning for dark-hole creation, justifying further investigation and eventually experimental validation on a dedicated testbed.</description>

      <title>The Double-Sided Silicon Strip Detector Tracker onboard the ComPair Balloon Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ComPair balloon instrument is a prototype of the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO) mission concept. AMEGO aims to bridge the spectral gap in sensitivity that currently exists from $\sim$100 keV to $\sim$100 MeV by being sensitive to both Compton and pair-production events. This is made possible through the use of four subsystems working together to reconstruct events: a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) Tracker, a virtual Frisch grid cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) Low Energy Calorimeter, a ceasium iodide (CsI) High Energy Calorimeter, and an anti-coincidence detector (ACD) to reject charged particle backgrounds. Composed of 10 layers of DSSDs, ComPair's Tracker is designed to measure the position of photons that Compton scatter in the silicon, as well as reconstruct the tracks of electrons and positrons from pair-production as they propagate through the detector. By using these positions, as well as the absorbed energies in the Tracker and 2 Calorimeters, the energy and direction of the incident photon can be determined. This proceeding will present the development, testing, and calibration of the ComPair DSSD Tracker and early results from its balloon flight in August 2023.</description>

      <title>Deep learning interpretable analysis for carbon star identification in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A large fraction of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars develop carbon-rich atmospheres during their evolution. Based on their color and luminosity, these carbon stars can be easily distinguished from many other kinds of stars. However, a large number of G, K, and M giants are also distributed in the same region as carbon stars on the HR diagram. Their spectra have differences,especially in the prominent CN molecular bands. Aims. We aim to distinguish carbon stars from other kinds of stars using Gaia's XP spectra, while providing attribution explanations of key features necessary for identification, and even discovering additional new spectral key features. Methods. We proposed a classification model named `GaiaNet', an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network specifically designed for handling Gaia's XP spectra. We utilized the SHAP interpretability model to calculate the SHAP value for each feature point in a spectrum, enabling us to explain the output of the `GaiaNet' model and provide further meaningful analysis Results. Compared to four traditional machine-learning methods, the `GaiaNet' model exhibits an average classification accuracy improvement of approximately 0.3% on the validation set, with the highest accuracy even reaching 100%. Utilizing the SHAP algorithm, we present a clear spectroscopic heatmap highlighting molecular band absorption features primarily distributed mainly around CN773.3 and CN895.0, and summarize five crucial feature regions for carbon star identification. Upon applying the trained classification model to the CSTAR sample with Gaia `xp_sampled_mean' spectra, we obtained 451 new candidate carbon stars as a by-product.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical method for mixed-frame multigroup radiation-hydrodynamics with GPU acceleration implemented in the QUOKKA code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-frame formulations of radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD), where the radiation quantities are computed in an inertial frame but matter quantities are in a comoving frame, are advantageous because they admit algorithms that conserve energy and momentum to machine precision and combine more naturally with adaptive mesh techniques, since unlike pure comoving-frame methods they do not face the problem that radiation quantities must change frame every time a cell is refined or coarsened. However, implementing multigroup RHD in a mixed-frame formulation presents challenges due to the complexity of handling frequency-dependent interactions and the Doppler shift of radiation boundaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for multigroup RHD that integrates a mixed-frame formulation with a piecewise powerlaw approximation for frequency dependence within groups. This approach ensures the exact conservation of total energy and momentum while effectively managing the Lorentz transformation of group boundaries and evaluation of group-averaged opacities. Our method takes advantage of the locality of matter-radiation coupling, allowing the source term for $N_g$ frequency groups to be handled with simple equations with a sparse Jacobian matrix of size $N_g + 1$, which can be inverted with $O(N_g)$ complexity. This results in a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N_g$ and requires no more communication than a pure hydrodynamics update, making it highly efficient for massively parallel and GPU-based systems. We implement our method in the GPU-accelerated RHD code QUOKKA and demonstrate that it passes a wide range of numerical tests. We demonstrate that the piecewise powerlaw method shows significant advantages over traditional opacity averaging methods for handling rapidly variable opacities with modest frequency resolution.</description>

      <title>Not So Fast: A New Catalog of Meteor Persistent Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a nearly two year long campaign to detect and analyze meteor persistent trains (PTs) - self-emitting phenomena which can linger up to an hour after their parent meteor. The modern understanding of PTs has been primarily developed from the Leonid storms at the turn of the century; our goal was to assess the validity of these conclusions using a diverse sample of meteors with a wide range of velocities and magnitudes. To this end, year-round observations were recorded by the Widefield Persistent Train camera, 2nd edition (WiPT2) and were passed through a pipeline to filter out airplanes and flag potential meteors. These were classified by visual inspection based on the presence and duration of trains. Observed meteors were cross-referenced with the Global Meteor Network (GMN) database, which independently detects and calculates meteor parameters, enabling statistical analysis of PT-leaving meteors. There were 4726 meteors codetected by the GMN, with 636 of these leaving trains. Among these were a large population of slow, dim meteors that left PTs; these slower meteors had a greater train production rate relative to their faster counterparts. Unlike prior research, we did not find a clear magnitude cutoff or a strong association with fast meteor showers. Additionally, we note several interesting trends not previously reported, which include PT eligibility being primarily determined by a meteor's terminal height and an apparent dynamical origin dependence that likely reflects physical meteoroid properties.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mergers in UNIONS -- I: A Simulation-driven Hybrid Deep Learning Ensemble for Pure Galaxy Merger Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merging and interactions can radically transform galaxies. However, identifying these events based solely on structure is challenging as the status of observed mergers is not easily accessible. Fortunately, cosmological simulations are now able to produce more realistic galaxy morphologies, allowing us to directly trace galaxy transformation throughout the merger sequence. To advance the potential of observational analysis closer to what is possible in simulations, we introduce a supervised deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) hybrid framework, Mummi (MUlti Model Merger Identifier). Mummi is trained on realism-added synthetic data from IllustrisTNG100-1, and is comprised of a multi-step ensemble of models to identify mergers and non-mergers, and to subsequently classify the mergers as interacting pairs or post-mergers. To train this ensemble of models, we generate a large imaging dataset of 6.4 million images targeting UNIONS with RealSimCFIS. We show that Mummi offers a significant improvement over many previous machine learning classifiers, achieving 95% pure classifications even at Gyr long timescales when using a jury-based decision making process, mitigating class imbalance issues that arise when identifying real galaxy mergers from $z=0$ to $0.3$. Additionally, we can divide the identified mergers into pairs and post-mergers at 96% success rate. We drastically decrease the false positive rate in galaxy merger samples by 75%. By applying Mummi to the UNIONS DR5-SDSS DR7 overlap, we report a catalog of 13,448 high confidence galaxy merger candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that Mummi produces powerful representations solely using supervised learning, which can be used to bridge galaxy morphologies in simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>REMIX SPH -- improving mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations using a generalised, material-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present REMIX, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme designed to alleviate effects that typically suppress mixing and instability growth at density discontinuities in SPH simulations. We approach this problem by directly targeting sources of kernel smoothing error and discretisation error, resulting in a generalised, material-independent formulation that improves the treatment both of discontinuities within a single material, for example in an ideal gas, and of interfaces between dissimilar materials. This approach also leads to improvements in capturing hydrodynamic behaviour unrelated to mixing, such as in shocks. We demonstrate marked improvements in three-dimensional test scenarios, focusing on more challenging cases with particles of equal mass across the simulation. This validates our methods for use-cases relevant across applications spanning astrophysics and engineering, where particles are free to evolve over a large range of density scales, or where emergent and evolving density discontinuities cannot easily be corrected by choosing bespoke particle masses in the initial conditions. We achieve these improvements while maintaining sharp discontinuities; without introducing additional equation of state dependence in, for example, particle volume elements; and without contrived or targeted corrections. Our methods build upon a fully compressible and thermodynamically consistent core-SPH construction, retaining Galilean invariance as well as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. REMIX is integrated in the open-source, state-of-the-art \swift code and is designed with computational efficiency in mind, which means that its improved hydrodynamic treatment can be used for high-resolution simulations without significant cost to run-speed.</description>

      <title>TESSILATOR: a one-stop shop for measuring TESS rotation periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a software package designed to produce photometric lightcurves and measure rotation periods from full-frame images taken by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which we name ``TESSILATOR''. TESSILATOR is the only publicly-available code that will run a full lightcurve and rotation period ($P_{\rm rot}$) analysis based on just a (list of) target identifier(s) or sky position(s) via a simple command-line prompt. This paper sets out to introduce the rationale for developing TESSILATOR, and then describes the methods, considerations and assumptions for: extracting photometry; dealing with potential contamination; accounting for natural and instrumental systematic effects; lightcurve normalisation and detrending; removing outliers and unreliable data; and finally, measuring the $P_{\rm rot}$ value and several periodogram attributes. Our methods have been tuned specifically to optimise TESS lightcurves and are independent from the pipelines developed by the TESS Science Processing Operations Center, meaning TESSILATOR can, in principle, analyse {\it any} target across the entire celestial sphere.
  We compare TESSILATOR $P_{\rm rot}$ measurements with TESS-SPOC-derived lightcurves of 1,560 (mainly FGKM-type) stars across four benchmark open clusters (Pisces-Eridanus, the Pleiades, the Hyades and Praesepe) and a sample of nearby field M-dwarfs. From a vetted subsample of 864 targets we find an excellent return of $P_{\rm rot}$ matches for the first 3 open clusters ($&gt;85$ per cent) and a moderate ($\sim 60$ per cent) match for the 700 Myr Praesepe and MEarth sample, which validates TESSILATOR as a tool for measuring $P_{\rm rot}$. The TESSILATOR code is available at \url{https://github.com/alexbinks/tessilator}.</description>

      <title>Binary orbit and disks properties of the RW Aur system using ALMA observations</title>

Abstract: The dynamical interactions between young binaries can perturb the material distribution of their circumstellar disks, and modify the planet formation process. In order to constrain the impact and nature of the binary interaction in the RW Aur system (bound or unbound), we analyzed the circumstellar material at 1.3 mm wavelengths, as observed at multiple epochs by ALMA. We analyzed the disk properties through parametric visibility modeling, and we used this information to constrain the dust morphology and the binary orbital period. We imaged the dust continuum emission of RW Aur with a resolution of 3 au, and we find that the radius enclosing 90% of the flux (R90%) is 19 au and 14 au for RW Aur A and B, respectively. By modeling the relative distance of the disks at each epoch, we find a consistent trend of movement for the disk of RW Aur B moving away from the disk of RW Aur A at an approximate rate of 3 mas/yr (about 0.5 au/yr in sky-projected distance). By combining ALMA astrometry, historical astrometry, and the dynamical masses of each star, we constrain the RW Aur binary stars to be most likely in a high-eccentricity elliptical orbit with a clockwise prograde orientation relative to RW Aur A, although low-eccentricity hyperbolic orbits are not ruled out by the astrometry. Our analysis does not exclude the possibility of a disk collision during the last interaction, which occurred $295_{-74}^{+21}$ yr ago relative to beginning of 2024. Evidence for the close interaction is found in a tentative warp of 6 deg in the inner 3 au of the disk of RW Aur A, in the brightness temperature of both disks, and in the morphology of the gas emission. A narrow ring that peaks at 6 au around RW Aur B is suggestive of captured material from the disk around RW Aur A.</description>

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Collaboration has embraced the concept of open access to their research data since its foundation, with the aim of giving access to the widest possible community. A gradual process of release began as early as 2007 when 1% of the cosmic-ray data was made public, along with 100% of the space-weather information. In February 2021, a portal was released containing 10% of cosmic-ray data collected from 2004 to 2018, during Phase I of the Observatory. The Portal included detailed documentation about the detection and reconstruction procedures, analysis codes that can be easily used and modified and, additionally, visualization tools. Since then the Portal has been updated and extended. In 2023, a catalog of the 100 highest-energy cosmic-ray events examined in depth has been included. A specific section dedicated to educational use has been developed with the expectation that these data will be explored by a wide and diverse community including professional and citizen-scientists, and used for educational and outreach initiatives. This paper describes the context, the spirit and the technical implementation of the release of data by the largest cosmic-ray detector ever built, and anticipates its future developments.</description>

      <title>Identifying noise transients in gravitational-wave data arising from nonlinear couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noise in various interferometer systems can sometimes couple non-linearly to create excess noise in the gravitational wave (GW) strain data. Third-order statistics, such as bicoherence and biphase, can identify these couplings and help discriminate those occurrences from astrophysical GW signals. However, the conventional analysis can yield large bicoherence values even when no phase-coupling is present, thereby, resulting in false identifications. Introducing artificial phase randomization in computing the bicoherence reduces such occurrences with negligible impact on its effectiveness for detecting true phase-coupled disturbances. We demonstrate this property with simulated disturbances in this work. Statistical hypothesis testing is used for distinguishing phase-coupled disturbances from non-phase coupled ones when employing the phase-randomized bicoherence. We also obtain an expression for the bicoherence value that minimizes the sum of the probabilities of false positives and false negatives. This can be chosen as a threshold for shortlisting bicoherence triggers for further scrutiny for the presence of non-linear coupling. Finally, the utility of the phase-randomized bicoherence analysis in GW time-series data is demonstrated for the following three scenarios: (1) Finding third-order statistical similarities within categories of noise transients, such as blips and koi fish. If these non-Gaussian noise transients, or glitches, have a common source, their bicoherence maps can have similarities arising from common bifrequencies related to that source. (2) Differentiating linear or non-linear phase-coupled glitches from compact binary coalescence signals through their bicoherence maps. This is explained with a simulated signal. (3) Identifying repeated bifrequencies in the second and third observation runs (i.e., O2 and O3) of LIGO and Virgo.</description>

      <title>Local Spherical Collapsing Box in Athena++: Numerical Implementation and Benchmark Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a local model for a spherical collapsing/expanding gas cloud into the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamic code. This local model consists of a Cartesian periodic box with time-dependent geometry. We present a series of benchmark test problems, including non-linear solutions and linear perturbations of the local model, confirming the code's desired performance. During a spherical collapse, a horizontal shear flow is amplified, corresponding to angular momentum conservation of zonal flows in the global problem; wave speed and amplitude of sound waves increase in the local frame, due to the reduction in the characteristic length scale of the box, which can lead to an anisotropic effective sound speed in the local box. Our code conserves both mass and momentum to machine precision. This numerical implementation of the local model has potential applications to the study of local physics and hydrodynamic instabilities during protostellar collapse, providing a powerful framework for better understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>DESI Early Data Release Milky Way Survey Value-Added Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the stellar value-added catalogue based on the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release. The catalogue contains radial velocity and stellar parameter measurements for $\simeq$ 400,000 unique stars observed during commissioning and survey validation by DESI. These observations were made under conditions similar to the Milky Way Survey (MWS) currently carried out by DESI but also include multiple specially targeted fields, such as those containing well-studied dwarf galaxies and stellar streams. The majority of observed stars have $16&lt;r&lt;20$ with a median signal-to-noise ratio in the spectra of $\sim$ 20. In the paper, we describe the structure of the catalogue, give an overview of different target classes observed, as well as provide recipes for selecting clean stellar samples. We validate the catalogue using external high-resolution measurements and show that radial velocities, surface gravities, and iron abundances determined by DESI are accurate to 1 km/s, $0.3$ dex and $\sim$ 0.15 dex respectively. We also demonstrate possible uses of the catalogue for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way stellar halo and Draco dwarf spheroidal. The value-added catalogue described in this paper is the very first DESI MWS catalogue. The next DESI data release, expected in less than a year, will add the data from the first year of DESI survey operations and will contain approximately 4 million stars, along with significant processing improvements.</description>
