      <title>A novel axiomatic approach to L-valued rough sets within an L-universe via inner product and outer product of L-subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fuzzy rough approximation operator serves as the cornerstone of fuzzy rough set theory and its practical applications. Axiomatization is a crucial approach in the exploration of fuzzy rough sets, aiming to offer a clear and direct characterization of fuzzy rough approximation operators. Among the fundamental tools employed in this process, the inner product and outer product of fuzzy sets stand out as essential components in the axiomatization of fuzzy rough sets. In this paper, we will develop the axiomatization of a comprehensive fuzzy rough set theory, that is, the so-called L-valued rough sets with an L-set serving as the foundational universe (referred to as the L-universe) for defining L-valued rough approximation operators, where L typically denotes a GL-quantale. Firstly, we give the notions of inner product and outer product of two L-subsets within an L-universe and examine their basic properties. It is shown that these notions are extensions of the corresponding notion of fuzzy sets within a classical universe. Secondly, leveraging the inner product and outer product of L-subsets, we respectively characterize L-valued upper and lower rough approximation operators generated by general, reflexive, transitive, symmetric, Euclidean, and median L-value relations on L-universe as well as their compositions. Finally, utilizing the provided axiomatic characterizations, we present the precise examples for the least and largest equivalent L-valued upper and lower rough approximation operators. Notably, many existing axiom characterizations of fuzzy rough sets within classical universe can be viewed as direct consequences of our findings.</description>

      <title>A note on subvarieties of powers of OT-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the space of finite-to-finite holomorphic correspondences on an OT-manifold is discrete. When the OT-manifold has no proper infinite complex-analytic subsets, it then follows by known model-theoretic results that its cartesian powers have no interesting complex-analytic families of subvarieties. The methods of proof, which are similar to [Moosa, Moraru, and Toma ``An essentially saturated surface not of K\"ahler-type", {\em Bull. of the LMS}, 40(5):845--854, 2008], require studying finite unramified covers of OT-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12144v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study generically extendible cardinals, which is a generic version of extendible cardinals. We prove that the generic extendibility of $\omega_1$ or $\omega_2$ has small consistency strength, but of a cardinal $&gt;\omega_2$ is not. We also consider some results concerning with generically extendible cardinals, such as indestructibility, generic absoluteness of the reals, and Boolean valued second order logic.</description>

      <title>Trivial Isomorphisms between Reduced Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06731v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for showing under weak forcing axioms that reduced products of countable models of a theory $T$ have as few automorphisms as possible. We show that such forcing axioms imply that reduced products of countably infinite or finite fields, linear orders, trees, or random graphs have only trivial automorphisms. We also show that Todor\v{c}evi\'c's Open Colouring Axiom, $\mathsf{OCA}_{\mathrm{T}}$, implies that all automorphisms of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})/{\mathrm{Fin}}$ are trivial.</description>

Abstract: Given any $\lambda\leq\kappa$, we construct a symmetric extension in which there is a set $X$ such that $\aleph(X)=\lambda$ and $\aleph^*(X)=\kappa$. Consequently, we show that $\mathsf{ZF}+$"For all pairs of infinite cardinals $\lambda\leq\kappa$ there is a set $X$ such that $\aleph(X)=\lambda\leq\kappa=\aleph^*(X)$" is consistent.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimensional Chain Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate higher dimensional chain conditions, where the largeness notion is given by Fubini products of a given ideal. From strong saturation properties of an ideal, we derive abstractly versions of higher dimensional $\Delta$-system lemma, which imply many posets, including any finite support iteration of $\sigma$-centered posets and measure algebras, satisfy the higher dimensional chain conditions. We then show that if a poset satisfies a strengthening of the $\sigma$-finite chain condition by Horn and Tarski, then it satisfies higher dimensional chain conditions. As an application, we derive Ramsey-theoretic consequences, namely various partition hypotheses as studied by Bannister, Bergfalk, Moore and Todorcevic, from the existence of ideals satisfying strong chain conditions.</description>

      <title>Whitehead's problem and condensed mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the better-known independence results in general mathematics is Shelah's solution to Whitehead's problem of whether $\mathrm{Ext}^1(A,\mathbb{Z})=0$ implies that an abelian group $A$ is free. The point of departure for the present work is Clausen and Scholze's proof that, in contrast, one natural interpretation of Whitehead's problem within their recently-developed framework of condensed mathematics has an affirmative answer in $\mathsf{ZFC}$. We record two alternative proofs of this result, as well as several original variations on it, both for their intrinsic interest and as a springboard for a broader study of the relations between condensed mathematics and set theoretic forcing. We show more particularly how the condensation $\underline{X}$ of any locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ may be viewed as an organized presentation of the forcing names for the points of canonical interpretations of $X$ in all possible set-forcing extensions of the universe, and we argue our main result by way of this fact. We show also that when interpreted within the category of light condensed abelian groups, Whitehead's problem is again independent of the $\mathsf{ZFC}$ axioms. In fact we show that it is consistent that Whitehead's problem has a negative solution within the category of $\kappa$-condensed abelian groups for every uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, but that this scenario, in turn, is inconsistent with the existence of a strongly compact cardinal.</description>

      <title>Proving Unsatisfiability with Hitting Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hitting formulas have been studied in many different contexts at least since [Iwama,89]. A hitting formula is a set of Boolean clauses such that any two of them cannot be simultaneously falsified. [Peitl,Szeider,05] conjectured that hitting formulas should contain the hardest formulas for resolution. They supported their conjecture with experimental findings. Using the fact that hitting formulas are easy to check for satisfiability we use them to build a static proof system Hitting: a refutation of a CNF in Hitting is an unsatisfiable hitting formula such that each of its clauses is a weakening of a clause of the refuted CNF. Comparing this system to resolution and other proof systems is equivalent to studying the hardness of hitting formulas.
  We show that tree-like resolution and Hitting are quasi-polynomially separated. We prove that Hitting is quasi-polynomially simulated by tree-like resolution, thus hitting formulas cannot be exponentially hard for resolution, so Peitl-Szeider's conjecture is partially refuted. Nevertheless Hitting is surprisingly difficult to polynomially simulate. Using the ideas of PIT for noncommutative circuits [Raz-Shpilka,05] we show that Hitting is simulated by Extended Frege. As a byproduct, we show that a number of static (semi)algebraic systems are verifiable in a deterministic polynomial time.
  We consider multiple extensions of Hitting. Hitting(+) formulas are conjunctions of clauses containing affine equations instead of just literals, and every assignment falsifies at most one clause. The resulting system is related to Res(+) proof system for which no superpolynomial lower bounds are known: Hitting(+) simulates the tree-like version of Res(+) and is at least quasi-polynomially stronger. We show an exponential lower bound for Hitting(+).</description>

Abstract: Elementary extensions to the topos axioms are considered in order to achieve the following na\"ive topological connectedness behaviors: (1) connected objects have exactly two complemented subobjects; (2) every point is contained in a connected complemented subobject, its connected component; and, (3) every object has a decidable quotient of these components.</description>

      <title>Projection-algebras and quantum logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: P-algebras are a non-commutative, non-associative generalization of Boolean algebras that are for quantum logic what Boolean algebras are for classical logic. P-algebras have type &lt;X, 0, ', .&gt; where 0 is a constant, ' is unary and . is binary. Elements of X are called features. A partial order is defined on the set X of features by x &lt;= y iff x.y = x. Features commute, i.e., x.y = y.x iff x.y &lt;= x. Features x and y are said to be orthogonal iff x.y = 0 and orthogonality is a symmetric relation.The operation + is defined as the dual of . and it is commutative on orthogonal features. The closed subspaces of a separable Hilbert space form a P-algebra under orthogonal complementation and projection of a subspace onto another one.P-algebras are complemented orthomodular posets but they are not lattices. Existence of least upper bounds for ascending sequences is equivalent to the existence of least upper bounds for countable sets of pairwise orthogonal elements. Atomic algebras are defined and their main properties are studied. The logic of P-algebras is then completely characterized. The language contains a unary connective corresponding to the operation ' and a binary connective corresponding to the operation ".". It is a substructural logic of sequents where the Exchange rule is extremely limited. It is proved to be sound and complete for P-algebras.</description>

      <title>Queries With Exact Truth Values in Paraconsistent Description Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to querying classical inconsistent description logic (DL) knowledge bases by adopting a~paraconsistent semantics with the four Belnapian values: exactly true ($\mathbf{T}$), exactly false ($\mathbf{F}$), both ($\mathbf{B}$), and neither ($\mathbf{N}$). In contrast to prior studies on paraconsistent DLs, we allow truth value operators in the query language, which can be used to differentiate between answers having contradictory evidence and those having only positive evidence. We present a reduction to classical DL query answering that allows us to pinpoint the precise combined and data complexity of answering queries with values in paraconsistent $\mathcal{ALCHI}$ and its sublogics. Notably, we show that tractable data complexity is retained for Horn DLs. We present a comparison with repair-based inconsistency-tolerant semantics, showing that the two approaches are incomparable.</description>
