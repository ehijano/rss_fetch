      <title>A multiscale hybrid Maxwellian-Monte-Carlo Coulomb collision algorithm for particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb collisions in particle simulations for weakly coupled plasmas are modeled by the Landau-Fokker-Planck equation, which is typically solved by Monte-Carlo (MC) methods. One of the main disadvantages of MC is the timestep accuracy constraint {\nu}{\Delta}t &lt;&lt; 1 to resolve the collision frequency {\nu}. The constraint becomes extremely stringent for self-collisions in the presence of high charge state species and for inter-species collisions with large mass disparities (such as present in Inertial Confinement Fusion hohlraums), rendering long-time-scale simulations prohibitively expensive or impractical. To overcome these difficulties, we explore a hybrid Maxwellian-MC (HMMC) model for particle simulations. Specifically, we devise a collisional algorithm that describes weakly collisional species with particles, and highly collisional species and fluid components with Maxwellians. We employ the Lemons method for particle-Maxwellian collisions, enhanced with a more careful treatment of low-relative-speed particles, and a five-moment model for Maxwellian-Maxwellian collisions. Particle-particle binary collisions are dealt with classic Takizuka-Abe MC, which we extend to accommodate arbitrary particle weights to deal with large density disparities without compromising conservation properties. HMMC is strictly conservative and significantly outperforms standard MC methods in situations with large mass disparities among species or large charge states, demonstrating orders of magnitude improvement in computational efficiency. We will substantiate the accuracy and performance of the proposed method with several examples of varying complexity, including both zero-dimensional relaxation and one-dimensional transport problems, the latter using a hybrid kinetic-ion/fluid-electron model.</description>

      <title>Compact quantum algorithms that can potentially maintain quantum advantage for solving time-dependent differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs governing fluid flow problems. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. These algorithms lead to low-depth quantum circuits that protect quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities that are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) ideal state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called $\textit{QFlowS}$; (b) experiments on a real quantum device (IBM Cairo); and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices.</description>

      <title>NH3 gas sensing over 2D Phosphorene sheet: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles based calculations were executed to investigate the sensing properties of ammonia gas molecules on two-dimensional pristine black phosphorene towards its application as a gas sensor and related applications. We discuss in detail, the interaction of ammonia gas molecules on the phosphorene single sheet through the structural change analysis, electronic band gap, Bader charge transfer, and density-of-states calculations. Our calculations indicate that the phosphorene could be used as a detector of ammonia, where good sensitivity and very short recovery time at room temperature have confirmed the potential use of phosphorene in the detection of ammonia.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under X-ray free electron laser illumination conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging technique of serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) can be used to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules to high spatial and temporal resolutions. An ongoing challenge for SFX is the damage caused by the ultrabright X-ray free electron laser pulse. Though it is often assumed that sufficiently femtosecond pulses `outrun' radiation damage, in reality electronic damage processes commence during exposure. We model the electronic damage to protein nanocrystals using a plasma model that tracks the continuous changes to the energy distribution of the unbound electrons. Tracking the continuous energy distribution is of particular importance for distinguishing the influence of differing elements on secondary damage processes. Heavy atoms have a ubiquitous but small presence in protein targets - typically as integral components of the macromolecule and as salts in the solvent. We find that these atoms considerably influence the simulated ionization and scattering behavior of realistic targets due to their rapid seeding of secondary ionization processes. In lysozyme, even the presence of native sulfur atoms significantly contributes to theoretical measures of damage-induced noise for &gt;= 6 keV, 15 fs pulses. Contributing to the effect is that heavy atoms seed `intermediate' energy electron cascades that are particularly effective at ionizing the target on the femtosecond timescale. In addition, the disproportionate effect of heavy atoms means the damage to a protein crystal can be sensitive to their presence in the solvent. Outside of reducing the concentration of heavy atoms in the target, these results suggest the dose limits of SFX targets will be higher where the ionization of deep &gt;~ 6 keV absorption edges is minimized, or, to a lesser extent, when such edges are only ionized with X-rays &gt;&gt; 2 keV above their binding energy.</description>

      <title>Overlap renormalization group transformations for disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a renormalization group approach which is implemented on the degrees of freedom defined by the overlap of two replicas to determine the critical fixed point and to extract four critical exponents for the phase transition of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. In addition, we couple the overlap order parameter to a fictitious field and introduce it within the two-replica Hamiltonian of the system to study its explicit symmetry-breaking with the renormalization group. Overlap transformations do not require a renormalization of the random couplings of a system to extract the critical exponents associated with the relevant variables of the renormalization group. We conclude by discussing the applicability of such transformations in the study of any phase transition which is fully characterized by an overlap order parameter.</description>

      <title>Aluminium nanoparticle-based ultra-wideband high-performance polarizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarizer-based device industry is expanding quickly, requiring high-quality research on nanoscale wideband polarizers. Here, we investigated the possibility of utilizing Al dimer nanostructures on broad-band polarizers. Metals are always considered promising candidates for reflection-based polarizer development because of their high extinction ratio. This study proposes a nanoparticle polarizer comprised of semi-immersed Al nanodimers with a 200 nm radius on a CaF_2 substrate. Our proposed polarizer has effective polarization anisotropy in the near-infrared (NIR) and THz range. This study includes calculating performance parameters for the extraction of the proposed polarizer, including insertion loss, extinction ratio (ER), Mueller matrix values, and polarization ellipse diagram. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation-based results suggested obtaining more than 55 dB extinction ratio for the 0.2 to 9 THz range. The average extinction ratio and insertion loss over the 1-1665 micrometer wavelength were 29.01 dB and ~1 dB, respectively. We have reviewed recent reports of similar nanoparticle and wire grid-based polarizers to evaluate our Al nanodimer-based polarizer and performed a comparative analysis. The idea of Al dimer and the insight gained from the results extracted from the rigorous simulation report suggested a great opportunity for developing micro-scale metallic wideband polarizers.</description>
