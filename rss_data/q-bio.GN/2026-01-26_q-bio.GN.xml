      <title>Ultrafast topological data analysis reveals pandemic-scale dynamics of convergent evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07292v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome variants which re-occur independently across evolutionary lineages are key molecular signatures of adaptation. Inferring the dynamics of such genetic changes from pandemic-scale genomic datasets is now possible, which opens up unprecedented insight into evolutionary processes. However, existing approaches depend on the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees, which remains challenging at scale. Here we present EVOtRec, an organism-agnostic, fast and scalable Topological Data Analysis approach that enables the inference of convergently evolving genomic variants over time directly from topological patterns in the dataset, without requiring the construction of a phylogenetic tree. Using data from both simulations and published experiments, we show that EVOtRec can robustly identify variants under positive selection and performs orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art phylogeny-based approaches, with comparable results. We apply EVOtRec to three large viral genome datasets: SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus A subtype H5N1 and HIV-1. We identify key convergent genome variants and demonstrate how EVOtRec facilitates the real-time tracking of high fitness variants in large datasets with millions of genomes, including effects modulated by varying genomic backgrounds. We envision our Topological Data Analysis approach as a new framework for efficient comparative genomics.</description>

      <title>SAGe: A Lightweight Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design for Mitigating the Data Preparation Bottleneck in Large-Scale Genome Sequence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03732v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome sequence analysis, which examines the DNA sequences of organisms, drives advances in many critical medical and biotechnological fields. Given its importance and the exponentially growing volumes of genomic sequence data, there are extensive efforts to accelerate genome sequence analysis. In this work, we demonstrate a major bottleneck that greatly limits and diminishes the benefits of state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators: the data preparation bottleneck, where genomic sequence data is stored in compressed form and needs to be first decompressed and formatted before an accelerator can operate on it. To mitigate this bottleneck, we propose SAGe, an algorithm-architecture co-design for highly-compressed storage and high-performance access of large-scale genomic sequence data. The key challenge is to improve data preparation performance while maintaining high compression ratios (comparable to genomic-specific compression algorithms) at low hardware cost. We address this challenge by leveraging key properties of genomic datasets to co-design (i) a lossless (de)compression algorithm, (ii) hardware that decompresses data with lightweight operations and efficient streaming accesses, (iii) storage data layout, and (iv) interface commands to access data. SAGe is highly versatile, as it supports datasets from different sequencing technologies and species. Due to its lightweight design, SAGe can be seamlessly integrated with a broad range of hardware accelerators for genome sequence analysis to mitigate their data preparation bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that SAGe improves the average end-to-end performance and energy efficiency of two state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators by 3.0x-32.1x and 13.0x-34.0x, respectively, compared to when the accelerators rely on state-of-the-art software and hardware decompression tools.</description>
