      <title>Collective adsorption of pheromones at the water-air interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the phase behaviour of pheromones and other messaging molecules remains a significant and largely unexplored challenge, even though it plays a central role in chemical communication. Here, we present all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the behavior of bombykol, a model insect pheromone, adsorbed at the water-air interface. This system serves as a proxy for studying the amphiphilic nature of pheromones and their interactions with aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Our simulations reveal the molecular organization of the bombykol monolayer and its adsorption isotherm. A soft-sticky particle equation of state accurately describes the monolayer's behavior. The analysis uncovers a two-dimensional liquid-gas phase transition within the monolayer. Collective adsorption stabilises the molecules at the interface and the calculated free energy gain is approximately $2\:k_\mathrm{B}T$. This value increases under lower estimates of the condensing surface concentration, thereby enhancing pheromone adsorption onto aerosols. Overall, our findings hold broad relevance for molecular interface science, atmospheric chemistry, and organismal chemical communication, particularly in highlighting the critical role of phase transition phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Criterion for Stokes-Einstein Relation Breakdown Based on Effective Collisional Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we propose a kinetic framework for interpreting the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation breakdown in supercooled liquids by introducing an effective collision diameter, $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$, derived from transport data. Numerical simulation of a model CuZr alloy reveal that $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ increases upon cooling but saturates near the first peak of the radial distribution function just before SE breakdown. This saturation defines a geometric upper bound for the collisional cross-section beyond which further slowdown is governed by cooperative, heterogeneous motion rather than local collisional transport. Our analysis yields a compact criterion for SE breakdown in a mean-field perspective and provides physically interpretable inputs for future data-driven models of glassy dynamics.</description>

      <title>A hybrid Green-Kubo (hGK) framework for calculating viscosity from short MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscosity calculation from equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations relies on the traditional Green-Kubo (GK) framework, which integrates the stress autocorrelation function (SACF) over time. While the formalism is exact in the linear response regime, the traditional approach often suffers from poor convergence and requires extensive phase space sampling, which is computationally demanding for soft matter and polymer systems. In this Letter, we introduce a hybrid Green-Kubo (hGK) framework that alleviates these limitations by partitioning the SACF into two physically meaningful regimes: (i) a short time ballistic component extracted directly from short MD simulations, and (ii) a long time relaxation tail represented using analytically motivated functions, $\phi(\tau)$, fitted only to short trajectories. This strategy bypasses the need for extensive sampling while preserving physical rigor. Benchmarking against SPC/E water confirms excellent agreement with established results, and we further demonstrate the efficacy of the method for challenging electrolyte systems (EC-LiTFSI and PEO-LiTFSI), for which the GK framework fails to converge. The computational savings are substantial, with reductions of several orders of magnitude in required sampling, achieved without compromising predictive accuracy. We also discuss the limitations of the hGK framework and outline clear avenues for refinement, including optimal tail selection and robust identification of relaxation regimes in noisy stress data. The hGK framework presented in this Letter provides a conceptually simple, broadly applicable, and computationally efficient route for viscosity prediction in molecular liquids, polymer melts, and ionically conducting soft materials.</description>

      <title>Why life is hot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of evolution by natural selection leads to fitness-maximising phenotypes. On the level of cellular chemical reaction networks, maximising fitness can mean optimising a variety of fitness functions such as robustness, precision, or sensitivity to external stimuli. Using theory and numerics, we show that these diverse goals can be achieved by a versatile, generic mechanism: coupling chemical reaction networks to reservoirs that are strongly out of equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the degree of optimality achievable by this mechanism saturates, and that nature appears to operate near saturation. We find that the amount of heat generated by this mechanism constitutes a significant fraction of the total heat produced by living organisms, so that 'life is hot' largely because of the need for a versatile mechanism to optimise a variety of fitness functions.</description>

      <title>Shape-specific fluctuations of an active colloidal interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-precision tracking of adipocyte dynamics via single lipid droplet whispering-gallery optical resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biophotonics - and more recently, biointegrated photonics - offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators - optical microcavities formed in spherical structures - have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.</description>
