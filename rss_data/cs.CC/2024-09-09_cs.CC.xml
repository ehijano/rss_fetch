      <title>Constant congestion linkages in polynomially strong digraphs in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given integers $k,c &gt; 0$, we say that a digraph $D$ is $(k,c)$-linked if for every pair of ordered sets $\{s_1, \ldots, s_k\}$ and $\{t_1, \ldots, t_k\}$ of vertices of $D$, there are $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ such that for $i \in [k]$ each $P_i$ is a path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ and every vertex of $D$ appears in at most $c$ of those paths. Thomassen [Combinatorica, 1991] showed that for every fixed $k \geq 2$ there is no integer $p$ such that every $p$-strong digraph is $(k,1)$-linked. Edwards et al. [ESA, 2017] showed that every digraph $D$ with directed treewidth at least some function $f(k)$ contains a large bramble of congestion $2$ and that every $(36k^3 + 2k)$-strong digraph containing a bramble of congestion $2$ and size roughly $188k^3$ is $(k,2)$-linked. Since the directed treewidth of a digraph has to be at least its strong connectivity, this implies that there is a function $L(k)$ such that every $L(k)$-strong digraph is $(k,2)$-linked. This result was improved by Campos et al. [ESA, 2023], who showed that any $k$-strong digraph containing a bramble of size at least $2k(c\cdot k -c + 2) + c(k-1)$ and congestion $c$ is $(k,c)$-linked. Regarding the bramble, although the given bound on $f(k)$ is very large, Masa\v{r}\'{\i}k et al. [SIDMA, 2022] showed that directed treewidth $\mathcal{O}(k^{48}\log^{13} k)$ suffices if the congestion is relaxed to $8$. We first show how to drop the dependence on $c$, for even $c$, on the size of the bramble that is needed in the work of Campos et al. [ESA, 2023]. Then, by making two local changes in the proof of Masa\v{r}\'{\i}k et al. [SIDMA, 2022] we show how to build in polynomial time a bramble of size $k$ and congestion $8$ assuming that a large obstruction to directed treewidth (namely, a path system) is given. Applying these results, we show that there is a polynomial function $g(k)$ such that every $g(k)$-strong digraph is $(k,8)$-linked.</description>

      <title>Red-Blue Pebbling with Multiple Processors: Time, Communication and Memory Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-studied red-blue pebble game models the execution of an arbitrary computational DAG by a single processor over a two-level memory hierarchy. We present a natural generalization to a multiprocessor setting where each processor has its own limited fast memory, and all processors share unlimited slow memory. To our knowledge, this is the first thorough study that combines pebbling and DAG scheduling problems, capturing the computation of general workloads on multiple processors with memory constraints and communication costs. Our pebbling model enables us to analyze trade-offs between workload balancing, communication and memory limitations, and it captures real-world factors such as superlinear speedups due to parallelization.
  Our results include upper and lower bounds on the pebbling cost, an analysis of a greedy pebbling strategy, and an extension of NP-hardness results for specific DAG classes from simpler models. For our main technical contribution, we show two inapproximability results that already hold for the long-standing problem of standard red-blue pebbling: (i) the optimal I/O cost cannot be approximated to any finite factor, and (ii) the optimal total cost (I/O+computation) can only be approximated to a limited constant factor, i.e., it does not allow for a polynomial-time approximation scheme. These results also carry over naturally to our multiprocessor pebbling model.</description>

      <title>Deriving differential approximation results for $k\,$CSPs from combinatorial designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, inapproximability results for $\mathsf{Max\,k\,CSP\!-\!q}$ have been established using balanced $t$-wise independent distributions, which are related to orthogonal arrays of strength $t$. We contribute to the field by exploring such combinatorial designs in the context of the differential approximation measure. First, we establish a connection between the average differential ratio and orthogonal arrays. We deduce a differential approximation ratio of $1/q^k$ on $(k +1)$-partite instances of $\mathsf{k\,CSP\!-\!q}$, $\Omega(1/n^{k/2})$ on Boolean instances, $\Omega(1/n)$ when $k =2$, and $\Omega(1/\nu^{k -\lceil\log_{p^\kappa} k\rceil})$ when $k\geq 3$ and $q\geq 3$, where $p^\kappa$ is the smallest prime power greater than $q$. Secondly, by considering pairs of arrays related to balanced $k$-wise independence, we establish a reduction from $\mathsf{k\,CSP\!-\!q}$ to $\mathsf{k\,CSP\!-\!k}$ (with $q&gt;k$), with an expansion factor of $1/(q -k/2)^k$ on the differential approximation guarantee. This, combined with the result of Yuri Nesterov, implies a lower differential approximability bound of $0.429/(q -1)^2$ for $\mathsf{2\,CSP\!-\!q}$. Finally, we prove that every Hamming ball with radius $k$ provides a $\Omega(1/n^k)$-approximation of the instance diameter. Our work highlights the utility of combinatorial designs in establishing approximation results.</description>

      <title>Hardness of sampling for the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a hardness of sampling result for the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on random graphs of average degree $d$ for large constant $d$, proving that when the normalized inverse temperature satisfies $\beta&gt;1$ (asymptotically corresponding to the condensation threshold), then w.h.p. over the random graph there is no stable sampling algorithm that can output a sample close in $W_2$ distance to the Gibbs measure. The results also apply to a fixed-magnetization version of the model, showing that there are no stable sampling algorithms for low but positive temperature max and min bisection distributions. These results show a gap in the tractability of search and sampling problems: while there are efficient algorithms to find near optimizers, stable sampling algorithms cannot access the Gibbs distribution concentrated on such solutions.
  Our techniques involve extensions of the interpolation technique relating behavior of the mean field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model to behavior of Ising models on random graphs of average degree $d$ for large $d$. While previous interpolation arguments compared the free energies of the two models, our argument compares the average energies and average overlaps in the two models.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Factored Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While graphs and abstract data structures can be large and complex, practical instances are often regular or highly structured. If the instance has sufficient structure, we might hope to compress the object into a more succinct representation. An efficient algorithm (with respect to the compressed input size) could then lead to more efficient computations than algorithms taking the explicit, uncompressed object as input. This leads to a natural question: when does knowing the input instance has a more succinct representation make computation easier?
  We initiate the study of the computational complexity of problems on factored graphs: graphs that are given as a formula of products and unions on smaller graphs. For any graph problem, we define a parameterized version that takes factored graphs as input, parameterized by the number of smaller graphs used to construct the factored graph. In this setting, we characterize the parameterized complexity of several natural graph problems, exhibiting a variety of complexities. We show that a decision version of lexicographically first maximal independent set is unconditionally XP-complete, and therefore not fixed parameter tractable (FPT). On the other hand, we show that clique counting is FPT. Finally, we show that reachability is FPT if and only if $\mathbf{NL}$ is in some fixed polynomial time.</description>
