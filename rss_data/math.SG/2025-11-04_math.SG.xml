      <title>Symplectifying Biarcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this follow-up article to Symplectification of Circular Arcs and Arc Splines, biarc geometry is examined from a purely geometric point of view. Two given points together with their associated tangent vectors in the plane are sufficient to define two directed, consecutive circular arcs. However, there remains one degree of freedom to determine the join point of both arcs. There are various approaches to this in the literature. A novel one is presented here.</description>

      <title>Constructing the big relative Fukaya category, and its open--closed maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues previous work of the author with Perutz, in which the `small' version of Seidel's relative Fukaya category of a smooth complex projective variety relative to a normal crossings divisor was constructed, under a semipositivity assumption. In the present work, we generalize this to construct the `big' relative Fukaya category in the same setting, as well as its closed--open and open--closed maps, and prove Abouzaid's split-generation criterion in this context. We also establish a general framework for constructing chain-level Floer-theoretic operations in this context, and dealing efficiently with signs and bounding cochains, which will be used in follow-up work with Ganatra to construct the cyclic open--closed map and establish its properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting the construction of global Kuranishi charts to the contact setting, we associate to any non-degenerate contact manifold a flow category based on Reeb orbits and moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic buildings. The construction lifts contact homology and is natural in the sense that to any exact symplectic cobordism we can associate a flow bimodule between the flow categories of its ends.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lefschetz fibrations with four-dimensional fibers from Seiberg--Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish constraints on the topology of smooth Lefschetz fibrations with $4$-dimensional fibers, by studying the family Bauer-Furuta invariant. To compute this invariant, we analyze the framed bordism class of 1-dimensional Seiberg--Witten moduli spaces using the local index theorem by Bismut--Freed. Using this, we deduce new obstructions to the smooth isotopy to the identity for compositions of Dehn twists on $(-2)$--spheres in closed $4$-manifolds. We obtain several applications: (1) We exhibit the first examples of closed simply-connected symplectic $4$-manifolds admitting Torelli symplectomorphisms which are smoothly non-trivial. In particular, their symplectic Torelli mapping class group is not generated by squared Dehn--Seidel twists on Lagrangian spheres -- providing a negative answer to a question of Donaldson. (2) We provide the first examples of irreducible closed $4$-manifolds (both symplectic and non-symplectic) that admit exotic diffeomorphisms given by Seifert-fibered Dehn twist.</description>

      <title>Unfolding of wild character varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study wild character varieties on compact Riemann surfaces and construct Poisson maps from wild to tame character varieties by unfolding irregular singularities into regular ones. Furthermore, we show that these unfolding Poisson maps induce Poisson birational equivalences between wild and tame character varieties. This result provides an affirmative answer to a conjecture posed by Klimes, Paul, and Ramis.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz fibrations on cotangent bundles and some plumbings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an idea of constructing Lefschetz fibrations of Weinstein manifolds from Weinstein handle decompositions on them. We prove theorems that formulate the idea for the cases of cotangent bundles and some plumbings. As a corollary, we give diffeomorphic families of plumbing spaces. Those diffeomorphic families contain some plumbing spaces with names. For example, Milnor fibers of $A_{4k+3}$ and $D_{4k+3}$ singularities are diffeomorphic if their complex dimension is odd.</description>

      <title>Connectedness of fibers beyond semitoric systems I: the non-degenerate case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the connectedness of the fibers of integrable systems that have only non-degenerate singular points and extend complexity one $T$-spaces with proper moment maps. Our main result states that if there are no tall singular points with a hyperbolic block and connected $T$-stabilizer, then each fiber is connected. Moreover, we prove that the above condition is necessary if either some reduced space is simply connected or the moment map for the integrable system is generic in a natural sense.</description>

      <title>The wrapped Fukaya category of plumbings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plumbing spaces have drawn significant attention among symplectic topologists due to their natural occurrence as examples of Weinstein manifolds. In our paper, we provide a general formula for the wrapped Fukaya category of plumbings (with arbitrary grading structure) of cotangent bundles along any quiver. Our approach relies on "local-to-global" computations. Specifically, we compute the wrapped Fukaya category of "plumbing sectors" that serve as local models for the singularities of Lagrangian skeletons of plumbing spaces. As corollaries, we fully describe the wrapped Fukaya category of plumbing spaces in dimension $4$ and plumbings of $T^*S^n$ for $n \geq 3$. We show that any Ginzburg dg algebra/category of a graded quiver without potential is equivalent to the wrapped Fukaya category of a plumbing of $T^*S^n$ (with the corresponding grading structure).</description>

      <title>Baker--Bowler theory for Lagrangian Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baker and Bowler showed that the Grassmannian can be defined over a tract, a field-like structure generalizing both partial fields and hyperfields. This notion unifies theories of matroids over partial fields, valuated matroids, and oriented matroids. We extend Baker--Bowler theory to the Lagrangian Grassmannian which is the set of maximal isotropic subspaces in a $2n$-dimensional symplectic vector space. By Boege et al., the Lagrangian Grassmannian is parameterized as a subset of the projective space of dimension $2^{n-2}(4+\binom{n}{2})-1$ and its image is cut out by certain quadrics. We simplify a list of quadrics so that these are apparently induced by the Laplace expansions only concerning principal and almost-principal minors of a symmetric matrix. From the idea that the strong basis exchange axiom of matroids captures the combinatorial essence of the Grassmann--Pl\"{u}cker relations, we define matroid-like objects, called antisymmetric matroids, derived from the quadrics for the Lagrangian Grassmannian. We also provide a cryptomorphic definition in terms of circuits capturing the orthogonality and maximality of a Lagrangian subspace. We define antisymmetric matroids over tracts in two equivalent ways, which generalize both BB theory and the parameterization of the Lagrangian Grassmannian. It provides a new perspective on the Lagrangian Grassmannian over hyperfields such as the tropical hyperfield and the sign hyperfield. Our proof involves a homotopy theorem for graphs associated with antisymmetric matroids, which generalizes Maurer's homotopy theorem for matroids. We also prove that if a point in the projective space satisfies the $3$-/$4$-term quadratic relations for the Lagrangian Grassmannian and its supports form the bases of an antisymmetric matroid, then it satisfies all quadratic relations, a result motivated by the earlier work of Tutte for matroids and the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Geometric models of simple Lie algebras via singularity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that ADE Dynkin diagrams classify both the simply-laced simple Lie algebras and simple singularities. We introduce a polygonal wheel in a plane for each case of ADE, called the Coxeter wheel. We show that equivalence classes of edges and spokes of a Coxeter wheel form a geometric root system isomorphic to the classical root system of the corresponding type. This wheel is in fact derived from the Milnor fiber of corresponding simple singularities of two variables, and the bilinear form on the geometric root system is the negative of its symmetrized Seifert form. Furthermore, we give a completely geometric definition of simple Lie algebras using arcs, Seifert form and variation operator of the singularity theory.</description>
