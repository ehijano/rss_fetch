      <title>A Structural Characterization of the Hit Image in the Motivic Steenrod Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00118v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motivic hit problem seeks a minimal generating set for the motivic cohomology of classifying spaces as a module over the motivic Steenrod algebra. In this paper, we provide a complete structural classification of the hit image within the top layer of Kameko's decomposition, revealing a sharp dichotomy governed by parity. Specifically, for degrees $d=k+2d_1$ with $d_1=(n-1)(2^k-1)$, let $V$ denote the span of the monotone translates of Kameko's monomial $z_k$. We prove that the intersection of $V$ with the hit subspace is exactly the even-parity hyperplane. Consequently, the quotient $V/(\text{hits})$ is one-dimensional and is generated by any odd-parity linear combination of these translates. This establishes the "odd-parity gap" as the precise obstruction to the hit property in this layer. As an arithmetic consequence of this structural result, we identify a new infinite numerical family with $n=2^r+1$ and $k=n-4$ ($r\ge 5$) where $\beta(d)&gt;n$. This yields a new class of counterexamples to the motivic Peterson-type conjecture, distinct from Kameko's original family. Furthermore, we show that these structural results and counterexamples persist over any algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$.</description>

      <title>Spectral sequence of an isometric action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a free smooth action $\Phi \colon G \times M \to M$ of a connected compact Lie group $G$ on a manifold $M$. We examine the Cartan filtration of the complex of differential forms of $M$. The associated spectral sequence ${E}^{{p,q}}_{_{r}}$ converges to the cohomology of $M$. It is well known that the second page ${E}^{{p,q}}_{_{2}}$ of this spectral sequence is given by $H^{^p} (M/G) \otimes H^{^q} (\mathfrak g)$, where $\mathfrak g$ denotes the Lie algebra of $G$.
  In this note, we provide a straightforward proof of this fact without using Mayer-Vietoris, harmonic operators, or other such methods found in existing proofs. In fact, we extend this result to the case where the action is locally free and $G$ is not compact, under the hypothesis that $\Phi$ extends to a smooth action of a compact Lie group $K$. The compactness of $K$ is a crucial aspect of our proof.
  When $G$ is not compact, the cohomology $H^{^p} (M/G) $ is not the cohomology of the orbit space $M/G$, which may be a topologically wild space, but rather the basic cohomology of the foliation determined by the action of $G$.</description>

      <title>Spectral complexes from truncated multicomplexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new construction of subcomplexes associated with a truncated multicomplex. Inspired by the machinery of spectral sequences, this construction yields a collection of interrelated subcomplexes whose differentials coincide with the spectral sequence differentials. These complexes refine the Rumin complex and retain the cohomology of the underlying multicomplex, providing a new tool for the study of subRiemannian geometry, particularly on Carnot groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute, at the prime $2$, the entire descent spectral sequence converging to the homotopy groups of the spectra of topological Jacobi forms $\mathrm{TJF}_m$ for every index $m \geq 1$. An explicit $\mathrm{TMF}$-cellular decomposition $\mathrm{TJF}_m \simeq \mathrm{TMF} \otimes P_m$ reduces the problem to analyzing a finite complex $P_m$ with one even cell in each dimension $\leq 2m$ except $2$. We identify all differentials using the cell structure.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite simplicial complex, let $g\colon K\to K$ be a simplicial map and let $f$ be a discrete Morse-Bott function on $K$ satisfying $f(g(\sigma))\leq f(\sigma)$ for all simplices $\sigma$ in $K$. We establish a set of inequalities (generalizing the Morse-Bott inequalities which we recover as a particular case when $g$ is the identity) relating the dynamics of $g$ and $f$.</description>

      <title>The algebraic structure of twisted topological Hochschild homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Hochschild homology (THH) is an invariant of ring spectra developed by B\"okstedt. In recent years many equivariant analogues to THH have emerged. One example is twisted THH which is an invariant of $C_n$-equivariant ring spectra developed by Angeltveit, Blumberg, Gerhardt, Hill, Lawson, and Mandell. In this paper, we study the algebraic structure of twisted THH, and perform some computations. Specifically, we compute $C_2$-twisted THH of the Real bordism spectrum and show that the $C_p$-twisted THH of geometric ring $C_p$-spectra reduces to a computation of classical THH. We extend the algebraic structure of twisted THH to the twisted B\"okstedt spectral sequence of Adamyk, Gerhardt, Hess, Klang, and Kong. We show that, under appropriate flatness conditions and for $R$ a commutative ring $C_p$-spectrum, the $C_p$-twisted B\"okstedt spectral sequence is a spectral sequence of commutative $\underline{E}_\star(R)$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Topology and Geometry of the Learning Space of ReLU Networks: Connectivity and Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of the parameter space in feed-forward ReLU networks is critical for effectively analyzing and guiding training dynamics. After initialization, training under gradient flow decisively restricts the parameter space to an algebraic variety that emerges from the homogeneous nature of the ReLU activation function. In this study, we examine two key challenges associated with feed-forward ReLU networks built on general directed acyclic graph (DAG) architectures: the (dis)connectedness of the parameter space and the existence of singularities within it. We extend previous results by providing a thorough characterization of connectedness, highlighting the roles of bottleneck nodes and balance conditions associated with specific subsets of the network. Our findings clearly demonstrate that singularities are intricately connected to the topology of the underlying DAG and its induced sub-networks. We discuss the reachability of these singularities and establish a principled connection with differentiable pruning. We validate our theory with simple numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relative homology group of an affine hyperplane arrangement and its Poincar\'e dual, the cohomology at finite distance of the complement. We give an Orlik--Solomon-type description of the latter, and identify it with the vector space of logarithmic forms having vanishing residues at infinity. To this end, we introduce a partial version of wonderful compactifications, which could be relevant in other contexts where blow-ups only occur at infinity. Finally, we show that the cohomology at finite distance coincides with the vector space of canonical forms in the sense of positive geometry.</description>

      <title>Factorization algebras in quite a lot of generality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a first stab at a mathematical framework in which one can study quantum field theories on spacetimes with quite general geometries. We will study these theories via their factorization algebras. The aim is to identify a minimalist formalism that makes sense of factorization algebras in any geometric context. This formalism extends the technology of factorization algebras to many new contexts, including those arising in arithmetic quantum field theories.
  In order to make sense of factorization algebras on a geometric object X, one needs two ingredients. First, one needs an additional piece of structure on X that we call an "isolability structure." This is the data required to say whether two (generalized) points of X are "distant." This is encoded as a functor from a certain combinatorial category of cographs. Second, one needs some sort of sheaf theory. The isolability structure then induces on the category of sheaves a kind of twofold symmetric monoidal structure. Factorization algebras are then defined in terms of this structure.
  This paper develops this formalism. We describe how some existing theories of factorization algebras fit into this framework, and we give a construction of the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian as a factorization stack that works in quite a lot of generality.</description>

      <title>Additive Partial Matchings Induced by Persistence Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.11100v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a fundamental tool in Topological Data Analysis. The associated algebraic structure is the persistence module, a sequence of vector spaces connected by linear maps. Persistence modules admit a complete and fast-to-compute invariant known as the persistence diagram. However, this is no longer the case for maps between persistence modules (i.e. persistence maps). We propose a new invariant for persistence maps, consisting of a partial matching between the persistent diagrams of the domain and codomain modules. We show that this invariant is additive with respect to the direct sum decomposition of persistence maps, is more discriminative than the image invariant, and is computable in cubic time. Furthermore, we provide an implementation and demonstrate its efficiency by integrating it with edge collapse techniques for flag complexes (e.g., Vietoris-Rips complexes). As a key technical contribution, we describe how to induce a persistence map between two flag complexes that have been independently simplified via edge collapses, even when a direct simplicial map between them is no longer available.</description>

Abstract: We study certain orientation-preserving involutions on three-dimensional small covers. We prove that the quotient space of an orientable three-dimensional small cover by such an involution in $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ is homeomorphic to a connected sum of copies of $S^2 \times S^1$. If this quotient space is a 3-sphere, then the corresponding small cover is a two-fold branched covering of the 3-sphere along a link. We provide a description of this link in terms of the polytope and the characteristic function.</description>

Abstract: For a circle action on a compact almost complex manifold with a fixed point, the lower bound on the number of fixed points is known in dimension up to 12 except 10. In this paper, we show that if the circle group acts on a 10-dimensional compact almost complex manifold with a fixed point, then there are at least 6 fixed points. This minimum is attained by $\mathbb{CP}^5$ and $S^6 \times \mathbb{CP}^2$. We establish this lower bound by showing that there does not exist a circle action on a 10-dimensional compact almost complex manifold with 4 fixed points.</description>

      <title>Unstable $1$-semiadditivity as classifying Goodwillie towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stable $\infty$-category is $1$-semiadditive if the norms for all finite group actions are equivalences. In the presence of $1$-semiadditivity, Goodwillie calculus simplifies drastically. We introduce two variants of $1$-semiadditivity for an $\infty$-category $C$ and study their relation to the Goodwillie calculus of functors $C \rightarrow \s(C)$. We demonstrate that these variations of $1$-semiadditivity are complete obstructions to the problem of endowing $\partial_\ast F$ with either a right module or a divided power right module structure which completely classifies the Goodwillie tower of $F$. We find applications to algebraic localizations of spaces, the Morita theory of operads, and bar-cobar duality of algebras. Along the way, we address several milestones in these areas including: Lie structures in the Goodwillie calculus of spaces, spectral Lie algebra models of $v_h$-periodic homotopy theory, and the Poincar\'e/Koszul duality of $E_d$-algebras.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of $\mathrm{R}$-Eulerian sequences for any $\mathcal{N}_\infty$-ring spectrum $\mathrm{R}$ of finite orientation order. We prove that each $\mathrm{R}$-Eulerian sequence determines a stable $\mathrm{R}$-cohomology operation. Furthermore, we show that the collection of $\mathrm{R}$-Eulerian sequences carries a natural additive and a multiplicative structure which is linear over the coefficient ring. As an application, we specialize to equivariant ordinary cohomology with coefficients in finite fields and construct genuine equivariant Steenrod operations for all finite groups.</description>

      <title>Interval Multiplicities of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11594v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any persistence module $M$ over a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$, and any interval $I$ of $\mathbf{P}$, we give a formula of the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$ of the interval module $V_I$ in the indecomposable decomposition of $M$ in terms of the ranks of matrices consisting of structure linear maps of the module $M$, which gives a generalization of the corresponding formula for 1-dimensional persistence modules. As an easy application, the formula enables us to compute the maximal interval-decomposable direct summand of $M$, which gives us a way to decide whether $M$ is interval-decomposable or not. In addition, when a set $V_{I_1}, \dots, V_{I_n}$ of interval direct summands of $M$ gives a specific property of $M$, we can study this property by directly computing the multiplicities $d_M(V_{I_i})$ by our formula without decomposing $M$. Moreover, the formula tells us which morphisms of $\mathbf{P}$ are essential to compute the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$. This suggests us some order-preserving map $\zeta \colon Z \to \mathbf{P}$ such that the induced restriction functor $R \colon \operatorname{mod} \mathbf{P} \to \operatorname{mod} Z$ has the property that the multiplicity $d:= d_{R(M)}(R(V_I))$ is equal to $d_M(V_I)$. In this case, we say that $\zeta$ essentially covers $I$. If $Z$ can be taken as a poset of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$, also known as a zigzag poset, then the calculation of the multiplicity $d$ can be done more efficiently, starting from the filtration level of topological spaces. Thus this even makes it unnecessary to compute the structure linear maps of $M$. Finally, we also give a formula of $d_M(V_I)$ in terms of a projective presentation of $M$ rather than its structure linear maps. In the 2D-grid case, this formula is more practical because in that case projective resolutions of $M$ can be computed from the filtration level of topological spaces.</description>
