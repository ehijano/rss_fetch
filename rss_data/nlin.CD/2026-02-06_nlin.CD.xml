      <title>Active Soft-Impact Oscillator: Dynamics of a Walking Droplet in a Non-Smooth Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Walking droplets are millimetric fluid drops that propel themselves across a vibrated liquid bath through interaction with their self-generated waves. They constitute classical active wave-particle entities and exhibit a range of hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We investigate an \emph{active soft-impact oscillator} as a minimal model for a walking droplet moving within a piecewise-smooth external potential, analogous to classical mass-spring soft-impact oscillators and recently explored quantum soft-impact oscillators. Our active soft-impact oscillator model couples a non-smooth soft-impact force to the Lorenz-like dynamics arising from the wave-particle entity. Theoretical and numerical exploration of the full parameter space reveals a wide variety of nonlinear behaviors and bifurcations driven by impact and grazing events. These include grazing-induced and impact-induced transitions between periodic and chaotic motion, as well as grazing-mediated attractor switching and impact-free (invisible) attractor switching. The active soft-impact oscillator thus provides a versatile platform for probing nonlinear impact dynamics in active systems and exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in non-smooth potentials.</description>

      <title>More on OTOCs and Chaos in Quantum Mechanics -- Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit thermal out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in single-particle quantum systems, focusing on magnetic billiards. Using the stadium billiard as a testbed, we compute the thermal OTOC $C_T(t) = -\langle [x(t), p]^2 \rangle_\beta$ and extract Lyapunov-like exponents $\lambda_L$ that quantify early-time growth. We map out $\lambda_L(T, B)$, revealing a crossover from quantum chaos to magnetic rigidity. In parallel, we compute an alternative OTOC built from guiding-center operators, which exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamics and no exponential growth. Our results offer a controlled framework for probing scrambling, temperature dependence, and the interplay of geometry and magnetic fields in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A hybrid dynamical-stochastic model of maximum temperature time series of Imphal, Northeast India incorporating nonlinear feedback and noise diagnostics</title>

Abstract: Climate variability is a complex phenomenon resulting from numerous interacting components of a climate system across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Although significant advances have been made in understanding global climate variability, there are relatively less studies on regional climate modeling, particularly in developing countries. In this work, we propose a framework of data driven hybrid dynamical stochastic modeling to investigate the variability of maximum temperature recorded for the capital city of Imphal in the state of Manipur, located in the Northeast India. In light of increasing concerns over global warming, studying maximum temperature variability over varying time scales is an important area of research. Analysis using publicly available climate data over the course of 73 years, our approach yields key insights into the temperature dynamics, such as a positive increase in temperature in the region during the period investigated. Our hybrid model, combining spectral analysis and Fourier decomposition methods with stochastic noise terms and nonlinear feedback mechanisms, is found to effectively reproduce the observed dynamics of maximum temperature variability with high accuracy. Our results are validated by robust statistical and qualitative tests. We further derive Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for the maximum temperature dynamics, offering the theoretical ground and analytical interpretation of the model that links the temperature dynamics with underlying physical principles.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between classical and quantum resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04793</link>

Abstract: Bifurcations take place in molecular Hamiltonian nonlinear systems as the excitation energy increases, this leading to the appearance of different classical resonances. In this paper, we study the quantum manifestations of these classical resonances in the isomerizing system CN-Li$\leftrightarrows$Li-CN. By using a correlation diagram of eigenenergies versus Planck constant, we show the existence of different series of avoided crossings, leading to the corresponding series of quantum resonances, which represent the quantum manifestations of the classical resonances. Moreover, the extrapolation of these series to $\hbar=0$ unveils the correspondence between the bifurcation energy of classical resonances and the energy of the series of quantum resonances in the semiclassical limit $\hbar\to0$. Additionally, in order to obtain analytical expressions for our results, a semiclassical theory is developed.</description>
