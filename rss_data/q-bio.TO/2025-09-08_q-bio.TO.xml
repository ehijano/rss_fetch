      <title>Thermodynamic analysis of water sorption isotherms on magnetically treated maize (Zea mays L.) seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic seed treatment (MST) is an effective technique for improving conditions in processes associated with germination, stability, and, ultimately, crop production. In this work, the technical management parameters related to the water adsorption process on magnetically treated Zea mays L. seeds will be determined. Models were compared to describe the experimentally obtained adsorption isotherms using nonlinear regressions. The modeling parameters, along with the Clausyus-Clapeyron equation, were used to determine the differential enthalpy, differential entropy, and Gibbs free energy present in the process. In addition, the compensation theory for this system was validated. The results indicate an overall reduction in the energy required to establish equilibrium in the water-seed system as the moisture content increases. A relationship is observed that will inject Gibbs free energy into the system at the extremes of the magnetic dose applied to the seeds. This relationship is stable as a first approximation to understand the energetic aspects when connecting the magnetic processing of seeds.</description>

      <title>Elasticity and plasticity of epithelial gap closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epiboly, during which a tissue closes around the surface of the egg, pervades animal development. This epithelial gap closure involves cell intercalations at the edge of the gap. Here, inspired by serosa closure in the beetle Tribolium, we study the interplay between these plastic cell rearrangements and the elasticity of the tissue in a minimal continuum model of the closure of a circular gap bounded by a contractile actomyosin cable. We discover two different closure mechanisms at the tissue scale depending on the energy barrier $E_\text{b}$ to and the energy $\Delta E$ released by intercalation: If $E_\text{b}\gg\Delta E$, cells intercalate into the gap to close it. For a fluidised tissue in which $E_\text{b}\ll\Delta E$, however, cells deintercalate from the boundary into the bulk of the tissue, and we reveal an emergent mechanical role of inhomogeneities of the actomyosin cable. Our work thus explains the mechanical role of tissue fluidisation in Tribolium serosa closure and processes of epiboly and wound healing more generally.</description>
