      <title>A zero-test for D-algebraic transseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider formal power series $f_1,\ldots, f_k\in\mathbb{Q}[[z]]$ that are defined as the solutions of a system of polynomial differential equations together with a sufficient number of initial conditions. Given $P\in \mathbb{Q}[F_1,\ldots,F_k]$, several algorithms have been proposed in order to test whether $P(f_1,\ldots,f_k)=0$. In this paper, we present such an algorithm for the case where $f_1,\ldots,f_k$ are so-called transseries instead of power series.</description>

      <title>Confluence of Conditional Rewriting Modulo</title>

Abstract: Sets of equations E play an important computational role in rewriting-based systems R by defining an equivalence relation =E inducing a partition of terms into E-equivalence classes on which rewriting computations, denoted -&gt;R/E and called *rewriting modulo E*, are issued. This paper investigates *confluence of -&gt;R/E*, usually called *E-confluence*, for *conditional* rewriting-based systems, where rewriting steps are determined by conditional rules. We rely on Jouannaud and Kirchner's framework to investigate confluence of an abstract relation R modulo an abstract equivalence relation E on a set A. We show how to particularize the framework to be used with conditional systems. Then, we show how to define appropriate finite sets of *conditional pairs* to prove and disprove E-confluence. In particular, we introduce *Logic-based Conditional Critical Pairs* which do not require the use of (often infinitely many) E-unifiers to provide a finite representation of the *local peaks* considered in the abstract framework. We also introduce *parametric Conditional Variable Pairs* which are essential to deal with conditional rules in the analysis of E-confluence. Our results apply to well-known classes of rewriting-based systems. In particular, to *Equational (Conditional) Term Rewriting Systems*. In this realm, our E-confluence results strictly subsume previous approaches by Huet and Jouannaud and Kirchner.</description>

      <title>UniSymNet: A Unified Symbolic Network Guided by Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for automatically discovering mathematical expressions from input data. Mainstream SR algorithms search for the optimal symbolic tree in a vast function space, but the increasing complexity of the tree structure limits their performance. Inspired by neural networks, symbolic networks have emerged as a promising new paradigm. However, most existing symbolic networks still face certain challenges: binary nonlinear operators $\{\times, \div\}$ cannot be naturally extended to multivariate operators, and training with fixed architecture often leads to higher complexity and overfitting. In this work, we propose a Unified Symbolic Network that unifies nonlinear binary operators into nested unary operators and define the conditions under which UniSymNet can reduce complexity. Moreover, we pre-train a Transformer model with a novel label encoding method to guide structural selection, and adopt objective-specific optimization strategies to learn the parameters of the symbolic network. UniSymNet shows high fitting accuracy, excellent symbolic solution rate, and relatively low expression complexity, achieving competitive performance on low-dimensional Standard Benchmarks and high-dimensional SRBench.</description>
