      <title>Bridging Quantum Computing and Nuclear Structure: Atomic Nuclei on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report accurate quantum simulations of medium-mass atomic nuclei -including oxygen, calcium, and nickel- on the RIKEN-Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer, achieving sub-percent accuracy. Using a symmetry-aware pair-unitary coupled-cluster doubles (pUCCD) ansatz implemented with a hard-core-boson mapping, and with particle-number-restoring post-selection, our ground-state energy estimates agree with noise-free statevector simulations and with exact diagonalization results on the order of 0.1% relative error. These experiments establish a new benchmark for quantum simulations of strongly correlated nuclear systems on real hardware and demonstrate the near-term potential of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear-structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear corrections to the nuclear heavy flavor structure functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerically the small-$x$ behaviour of the nuclear gluon distribution function $ G^A(x,Q^2)$ at next-to-leading order (NLO) approximation of the Gribov-Levin-Ryskin-Mueller-Qiu, Zhu-Ruan-Shen (GLR-MQ-ZRS) nonlinear equation and quantify the impact of gluon recombination in the kinematic range of $x \le 10^{-2}$ and $Q^2 \ge 5 \text{GeV}^2$ respectively. The results are comparable to the Rausch-Guzey-Klasen (RGK) [J.Rausch, V.Guzey and M.Klasen, Phys. Rev. D 107, 054003 (2023)] nuclear gluon distributions and the nCTEQ15 parametrization at the corresponding $Q^2$ values. Using the solutions of $ G^A(x,Q^2)$ in the framework of the nonlinear GLR-MQ-ZRS evolution equation, the linear and nonlinear behavior of the charm structure functions of nuclei per nucleon $F^{c\bar{c}-A}_2(x,Q^2)$ and $F^{c\bar{c}-A}_L(x,Q^2)$ are considered. The results reveal that nonlinear corrections play an important role in charm nuclear reduced cross sections at small-$ x$ and low $Q^2$ values. The computed results are compared with experimental data from the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations.</description>

      <title>Probing Initial State Clustering through Photon Anisotropic Flow in 7A TeV $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of $\alpha$ clustered structures in light nuclei can enhance the initial spatial anisotropies in relativistic nuclear collisions relative to those arising from nuclei with uniform density distributions. Thus, observables that are strongly sensitive to the initial geometry can be a more efficient probe of the clustered structures than observables dominated by final state dynamics. We investigate the collisions of $\alpha$ clustered oxygen nuclei at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7$A TeV at the LHC using the GLISSANDO initial state model along with the MUSIC event-by-event hydrodynamical framework. The tetrahedral $\alpha$ clustered structure of $^{16}$O leads to significantly larger initial triangular eccentricity $\epsilon_3$ than collisions with uniform density distributions especially in the most central events. The spatial eccentricity $\epsilon_2$ is found to be relatively less sensitive to the initial state clustered structure. The production of thermal photons is estimated to be only marginally influenced by clustering for both central as well as peripheral collisions. In contrast, the photon triangular flow coefficient $v_3(p_T)$ is strongly affected by initial state clustering resulting in substantially larger values in both central and peripheral collisions. An experimental determination of photon anisotropic flow together with the ratios of flow coefficients in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions therefore expected to provide valuable insight into the possible clustered structure in light nuclei and also to constrain parameters in theoretical modeling.</description>

      <title>Nucleon momentum fractionation effect on pion production in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pion production in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies provides an important probe of the collision dynamics and nuclear matter equation of state, especially the high-density behavior of the symmetry energy. Using the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model with a recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N5LO Skyrme pseudopotential, we investigate the effects of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials on the pion production in Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$ GeV/nucleon. We find that a stronger momentum dependence, for which the nucleon mean-field potentials increase faster with momentum, generally suppresses pion production. This feature can be understood in terms of the nucleon momentum fractionation effect, namely, a stronger momentum dependence can reduce the relative fraction of high-momentum nucleons in heavy-ion collisions, thereby suppressing the production of $\Delta$ resonances and pions.</description>

      <title>Roles of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore phase structures and hadron mass spectra in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors where the sign problem disappears. We particularly focus on $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We employ an $N_f=2+2$ linear sigma model based on the $SU(8)$ Pauli-G\"{u}rsey symmetry to describe negative-parity as well as positive-parity hadrons, for which low-energy excitations are appropriately described particularly in the baryon superfluid phase with light diquark condensates. As a result, the strange chiral condensate is found to be enhanced in the superfluid phase owing to the flavor-mixing structure of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We also confirm this enhancement by means of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Besides, our present analysis predicts the existence of a novel superfluid phase where heavy diquarks condense in dense regime. The topological susceptibility with $2+2$ flavors from the viewpoints of the anomaly effects and chiral-symmetry restoration is investigated. Furthermore, we derive a complete inverse mass hierarchy for negative-parity diquarks with sufficient anomaly effects. Our findings are expected to provide future lattice simulations with useful information on flavor-symmetry violation from the $U(1)$ axial anomaly aspects in cold and dense two-color QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of Light Hexaquark States in Triquark-antitriquark Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the nature of $X(2075)$ and $X(2085)$ observed by the BESIII collaboration in the $p\bar{\Lambda}$ system, we systematically investigate the possibility that these states are compact hexaquark with triquark-antitriquark configurations for the first time. Within the framework of QCD sum rules, the mass spectrum and decay constants of such hexaquark states with quantum numbers $J^P=0^-, 0^+, 1^-, 1^+$ are studied. Consequently, six independent and nondegenerate hexaquark candidates are obtained, among which two $J^P = 1^-$ states exhibit masses consistent with $X(2075)$, while the two $J^P = 1^+$ states differ markedly from the mass of $X(2075)$ or $X(2085)$. The remaining two states with $J^P = 0^+$ and $0^-$ may serve as predictions for potential compact hexaquark configurations. Furthermore, the possible decay modes of these hexaquark states are analyzed, which could be the experimental signatures for their identification.</description>

      <title>Baryons as linked vortices in QCD matter with isospin asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a baryonic structure in low-energy QCD via a model-independent way using the chiral perturbation theory at the leading order, in the presence of the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, the isospin chemical potential $\mu_I$, and the electromagnetic coupling. For such a scenario in the chiral limit, it has been known that the neutral pion winds like in the chiral soliton lattice, confined within an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex of the charged pions. This structure undergoes a drastic transformation when the pion mass is introduced, i.e., both charged and neutral pions condense in the bulk, allowing two distinct types of vortices: the charged pions constitute a local ANO-like vortex, while the neutral pion configures a global vortex which is further attached to a domain wall also known as the chiral soliton. Remarkably, the ANO vortex forms a topological linking with the closed global vortex line, when $\mu_B$ exceeds its critical value as a function of $\mu_I$. The linking number has the physical meaning of the baryon number in view of the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. In this sense, the linked configuration realizes a stable Skyrmion-type solution, but innovatively without the Skyrme term. We therefore propose a novel phase of dense baryonic matter comprised of such vortices, which shall play a role in the low-energy QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Thermal quarks and Polyakov loops in two-color dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study confinement and deconfinement in dense two color QCD by analyzing the dynamics of thermal quarks and gluons. The Polyakov loop is used as a probe of the relevant thermal excitations, distinguishing quark and hadron dominated regimes in dense matter. To describe the Polyakov loop, we adopt both lattice informed phenomenological models and the massive Yang Mills framework. After calibrating these models at zero density, we investigate in medium modifications of the Polyakov loops and gluon propagators at finite temperature and density. Diquark gaps control the screening at zero temperature, whereas the screening due to thermal quarks is sensitive to the Polyakov loop. Inclusion of the Polyakov loop helps to reproduce lattice data at low temperature, suggesting that thermal excitations are predominantly hadronic rather than uncorrelated quarks.</description>

      <title>Symmetry energy expansion and the peak value of the bulk viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion is a useful way to parametrize the properties of dense matter near nuclear saturation density, and much work has been done to connect physical quantities like the neutron star radius and the core-crust transition density to the symmetry energy parameters. In this work, I connect the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter to the symmetry parameters by calculating the susceptibilities of dense matter in terms of the symmetry energy. I use this result to calculate the resonant-peak value of the bulk viscosity as a function of density, finding that it strongly depends on $L$, as does the minimum bulk-viscous dissipation timescale. Also resulting from this calculation is a formula for finding the conformal points of the zero-temperature equation of state. Finally, I determine for which values of the symmetry parameters the maximum r-mode-stable rotation frequency of an $npe$-matter neutron star is smaller than the Kepler frequency, in the high-temperature conditions where bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipation mechanism.</description>
