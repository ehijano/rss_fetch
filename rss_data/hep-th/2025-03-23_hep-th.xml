      <title>Localisation of the M2-brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum M2-branes in holographic backgrounds and show that their moduli spaces of zero-modes are localised according to an R-symmetry Killing vector. We discuss the relation with recent results in the context of equivariant localisation in gauged supergravity and argue its origin within M-theory path integrals that are expanded in saddle points over M2-branes. When field theory comparison is available, we observe that the instanton partition functions is one-loop exact. This extends recent observations in the context of the giant graviton expansion of superconformal indices to generic supersymmetric AdS boundary conditions. As a byproduct we predict non-perturbative corrections to a variety of supersymmetric observables of the ABJM theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamically induced spin-2 mass in a Weyl-invariant framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the ghost-free bimetric theory of gravity with the concept of local Weyl invariance, realized in the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity. The gravitational sector, characterized by two independent metrics and two independent connections, is coupled to a scalar field that can in principle develop a non-vanishing expectation value through radiative corrections. The spectrum of the model, apart from the massless standard graviton and a pair of axion-like pseudoscalars, associated with the presence of the Holst invariants in the action, includes an additional spin-$2$ state of a non-vanishing Fierz-Pauli mass proportional to the scalar field vacuum expectation value. We analyze the phenomenology of the model and specify the conditions under which the massive spin-$2$ state could be a primary dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and M-theory-like Vacua in Four Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-geometric flux vacua have recently been revisited, leading to the remarkable discovery of isolated 4D ${\mathcal N}=1$ supersymmetric Minkowski vacua. These constructions rely on the non-renormalization of the superpotential, which is supported by heuristic arguments. Given the significance of verifying the existence of these isolated M-theory-like vacua, we present alternative symmetry-based arguments that arrive at the same conclusion. Additionally, we leverage these symmetries to argue for the existence of unstable dS solutions as well as supersymmetric AdS solutions.</description>

      <title>SOFIA: Singularities of Feynman Integrals Automatized</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SOFIA, a Mathematica package that automatizes the computation of singularities of Feynman integrals, based on new theoretical understanding of their analytic structure. Given a Feynman diagram, SOFIA generates a list of potential singularities along with a candidate symbol alphabet. The package also provides a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing the analytic properties of Feynman integrals and related objects, such as cosmological and energy correlators. We showcase its capabilities by reproducing known results and predicting singularities and symbol alphabets of Feynman integrals at and beyond the high-precision frontier.</description>

      <title>Superadditivity at Large Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak gravity conjecture has been invoked to conjecture that the dimensions of charged operators in a CFT should obey a superadditivity relation (sometimes referred to as convexity). In this paper, we study superadditivity of the operator spectrum in theories expanded about the semi-classical saddle point that dominates correlators of large charge operators. We explore this in two contexts. The first is a model with two scalar fields that carry different charges, at a non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point. A careful analysis of the semi-classics for this two field model demonstrates that 'quantum' violations of superadditivity (those not forbidden by the conjecture) persist in the large charge regime. We then turn to study the general properties of CFTs at large charge as bottom-up EFTs. By a trial and error procedure we come up with a seemingly consistent family of examples violating the conjecture. In so doing the presence of a genuine dilaton field appears necessary. On the one hand our result demonstrates that the superadditivity conjecture cannot be proven purely on the basis of a bottom-up analysis. On the other hand, the need for a dilaton, with the corresponding infinite fine tuning, indicates the conjecture-violating EFTs are unlikely to be UV completable.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Complementarity and ER/EPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that wormholes must be entangled regardless of asymptotic boundary conditions. Assuming black hole complementarity, we argue that traversable wormholes instantiate entanglement-assisted quantum channels and that this entanglement must be present between the stretched horizons as an initial condition prior to traversability. This result demonstrates the forward direction of the ER/EPR conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a real tachyon vacuum solution in cubic superstring field theory that avoids square roots and phantom terms. Using this new solution, we evaluate the vacuum energy and obtain a result consistent with Sen's conjecture. Additionally, we demonstrate that the equation of motion, when contracted with the solution itself, is satisfied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general formalism to describe the Renormalization Group Flow of Schur indices and fusion algebras of BPS line defects in four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theories. The formalism includes and extends known results about the Seiberg-Witten description of these structures. Another application of the formalism is to describe the spectrum of BPS partices of ${\mathcal N}=2$ gauge theories with matter in terms of the spectrum of pure ${\mathcal N}=2$ gauge theories. Applications to the theory of quantum groups and to the quantization of cluster varieties are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Optical Effects in an Electric Dipole Spin Polarised Relativistic Quantum Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The covariant, spin-dependent response tensor for an electric dipole moment polarized electron gas (statistical distribution of electrons and positrons) is calculated using the formalism of quantum plasmadynamics. A simultaneous eigenfunction of both the Dirac Hamiltonian and the electric moment spin operator is constructed. Expressions for the electric moment states and the corresponding vertex functions are derived. It is shown that when the distribution of momenta is isotropic, the spin dependent response of an electric moment dependent quantum plasma is identically zero. The response is non-zero in the presence of a streaming motion perpendicular to the axis if the electron and positron distributions are different. The response has the same form as for a plasma with a nonzero, cross field current when $\langle p_{i} \rangle \neq 0$. This quantum relativistic correction is used to identify the dispersion equation for an electric moment spin polarised plasma with a streaming cold plasma background. In particular, the natural modes of an electric moment dependent quantum plasma exhibit elliptical polarisation. This is in contrast to a magnetic moment dependent electron gas, which is gyrotropic, or a helicity dependent electron gas which is optically active. The different responses, due to quantum plasmas being spin polarised by different relativistically acceptable spin operators, does not appear in other approaches to quantum plasma theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review exceptional field theories as the duality-covariant reformulation of maximal supergravity theories in ten and eleven dimensions, that make the underlying exceptional symmetries explicit. Beyond their structural role in unifying the various maximal supergravities, we illustrate how they also provide access to very efficient techniques for tackling concrete computational problems in supergravity.</description>

Abstract: We study the decomposition of the holographic 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(M)$ gauge theory with in the Klebanov-Strassler set-up. In particular, we propose a consistent framework for defining a modified instanton sum and a 4-group structure for the SYM theory, derived from its $AdS/CFT$ construction. To achieve this, we analyse symmetry topological operators associated with continuous $(-1)$-form symmetries, derive the corresponding 5-dimensional Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), and impose specific discrete gaugings.</description>

      <title>All-loop Leading Singularities of Wilson Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlators of null, $n$-sided polygonal Wilson loops with a Lagrangian insertion in the planar limit of the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. This finite observable is closely related to loop integrands of maximally-helicity-violating amplitudes in the same theory, and, conjecturally, to all-plus helicity amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills theory. The resulting function has been observed to have an expansion in terms of functions of uniform transcendental weight, multiplied by certain rational prefactors, called leading singularities. In this work we prove several conjectures about the leading singularities: we classify and compute them at any loop order and for any number of edges of the Wilson loop, and show that they have a hidden conformal symmetry. This is achieved by leveraging the geometric definition of the loop integrand via the Amplituhedron. The leading singularities can be seen as maximal codimension residues of the integrand, and the boundary structure of the Amplituhedron geometry restricts which iterative residues are accessible. Combining this idea with a further geometric decomposition of the Amplituhedron in terms of so-called negative geometries allows us to identify the complete set of leading singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that if one solves self-consistently the semiclassical Einstein equations in the presence of a quantum scalar field, with a cutoff on the number of modes, spacetime become flatter when the cutoff increases. Here we extend the result to include the effect of fields with spin 0, 1/2, 1 and 2. With minor adjustments, the main result persists. Remarkably, one can have positive curvature even if the cosmological constant in the bare action is negative.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate black hole quasinormal modes using the exact WKB method. We perform an analytic continuation from the horizon to infinity along the positive real axis of the radial coordinate and impose appropriate boundary conditions at these asymptotic positions. We clarify the role of previously overlooked logarithmic spirals of Stokes curves and branch cuts emerging from the horizon. We carefully reformulate the derivation of the quasinormal mode conditions using the exact WKB analysis, incorporating the contributions from these features into the calculation. We successfully derive correct results for both solvable model examples and the Schwarzschild spacetime. Our formulation enjoys straightforward extensions to other background geometries as well as a wide range of other physical systems.</description>

      <title>Finite group gauge theory on graphs and gravity-like modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gauge theory with finite group $G$ on a graph $X$ using noncommutative differential geometry and Hopf algebra methods with $G$-valued holonomies replaced by gauge fields valued in a `finite group Lie algebra' subset of the group algebra $\mathbb{C} G$ corresponding to the complete graph differential structure on $G$. We show that this richer theory decomposes as a product over the nontrivial irreducible representations $\rho$ with dimension $d_\rho$ of certain noncommutative $U(d_\rho)$-Yang-Mills theories, which we introduce. The Yang-Mills action recovers the Wilson action for a lattice but now with additional terms. We compute the moduli space $\mathcal{A}^\times / \mathcal{G}$ of regular connections modulo gauge transformations on connected graphs $X$. For $G$ Abelian, this is given as expected phases associated to fundamental loops but with additional $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$-valued modes on every edge resembling the metric for quantum gravity models on graphs. For nonAbelian $G$, these modes become positive-matrix valued modes. We study the quantum gauge field theory in the Abelian case in a functional integral approach, particularly for $X$ the finite chain $A_{n+1}$, the $n$-gon $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and the single plaquette $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$. We show that, in stark contrast to usual lattice gauge theory, the Lorentzian version is well-behaved, and we identify novel boundary vs bulk effects in the case of the finite chain. We also consider gauge fields valued in the finite-group Lie algebra corresponding to a general Cayley graph differential calculus on $G$, where we study an obstruction to closure of gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Chiral Anomaly in Spin-1 Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral anomaly is a key feature of Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories: in presence of parallel external electric and magnetic fields, the number of massless Weyl fermions of a given chirality is not conserved. In condensed matter, emergent chiral fermions in Weyl semimetals exhibit the same anomaly, directly tied to the topological charge of the Weyl node, ensuring a quantized anomaly coefficient. However, many condensed matter systems break Lorentz symmetry while retaining topological nodes, raising the question of how chiral anomaly manifests in such settings. In this work, we investigate this question in spin-1 fermionic systems and show that the conventional anomaly equation is modified by an additional nontopological contribution, leading to a nonquantized anomaly coefficient. This surprising result arises because spin-1 fermions can be decomposed into 2-flavor Weyl fermions coupled to a Lorentz-breaking, momentum-dependent non-Abelian background potential. The interplay between this potential and external electromagnetic fields generates the extra term in the anomaly equation. Our framework naturally generalizes to other Lorentz-breaking systems beyond the spin-1 case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the relativistic dynamics of vector bosons within the context of rotating frames of negative curvature wormholes. We seek exact solutions for the fully-covariant vector boson equation, derived as an excited state of zitterbewegung. This equation encompasses a symmetric rank-two spinor, enabling the derivation of a non-perturbative second-order wave equation for the system under consideration. Our findings present exact results in two distinct scenarios. Notably, we demonstrate the adaptability of our results to massless vector bosons without compromising generality. The evolution of this system is shown to correlate with the angular frequency of the uniformly rotating reference frame and the curvature radius of the wormholes. Moreover, our results highlight that the interplay between the spin of the vector boson and the angular frequency of the rotating frame can give rise to real oscillation modes, particularly evident in excited states for massless vector bosons. Intriguingly, we note that the energy spectra obtained remain the same whether the wormhole is of hyperbolic or elliptic nature.</description>

      <title>Ergodic behaviors in reversible 3-state cellular automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical cellular automata represent a class of explicit discrete spacetime lattice models in which complex large-scale phenomena emerge from simple deterministic rules. With the goal to uncover different physically distinct classes of ergodic behavior, we perform a systematic study of three-state cellular automata (with a stable `vacuum' state and `particles' with $\pm$ charges). The classification is aided by the automata's different transformation properties under discrete symmetries: charge conjugation, spatial parity and time reversal. In particular, we propose a simple classification that distinguishes between types and levels of ergodic behavior in such system as quantified by the following observables: the mean return time, the number of conserved quantities, and the scaling of correlation functions. In each of the physically distinct classes, we present examples and discuss some of their phenomenology. This includes chaotic or ergodic dynamics, phase-space fragmentation, Ruelle-Pollicott resonances, existence of quasilocal charges, and anomalous transport with a variety of dynamical exponents.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram for Large $N_f$ : Analysis from Contact Interaction Effective Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the impact of a higher number of light quark flavors, $N_f$, on the QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions. Our formalism is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation, employing a specific symmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dressed contact interaction model of quarks in Landau gauge, utilizing the rainbow-Ladder truncation. We derive expressions for the dressed quark mass $M_f$ and effective potential $\Omega^{f}$ at zero, at finite temperature $T$ and the quark chemical potential $\mu$. The transition between chiral symmetry breaking and restoration is triggered by the effective potential of the contact interaction, whereas the confinement and deconfinement transition is approximated from the confinement length scale $\tilde{\tau}_{ir}$. Our analysis reveals that at $(T = \mu = 0)$, increasing $N_f$ leads to the restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement of quarks when $N_f$ reaches its critical value, $N^{c}_{f} \approx 8$. At this critical value, In the chiral limit ($m_f = 0$), the global minimum of the effective potential occurs at the point where the dressed quark mass approaches zero ($M_f \rightarrow 0$). However, when a bare quark mass of $m_f = 7$ MeV is introduced, the global minimum shifts slightly to a nonzero value, approaching $M_f \rightarrow m_f$. At finite $T$ and $\mu$, we illustrate the QCD phase diagram in the $(T^{\chi,C}_{c} -\mu)$ plane, for various numbers of light quark flavors, noting that both the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical chemical potential $\mu_c $ for chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement decrease as $ N_f $ increases. Moreover, the critical endpoint $(T_{EP}, \mu_{EP})$ also shifts to lower values with increasing $N_f $. Our findings are consistent with other low-energy QCD approaches.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous order known as chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A close relation has recently emerged between two of the most fundamental concepts in physics and mathematics: chaos and supersymmetry. In striking contrast to the semantics of the word 'chaos,' the true physical essence of this phenomenon now appears to be a spontaneous order associated with the breakdown of the topological supersymmetry (TS) hidden in all stochastic (partial) differential equations, i.e., in all systems from a broad domain ranging from cosmology to nanoscience. Among the low-hanging fruits of this new perspective, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), are theoretical explanations of 1/f noise and self-organized criticality. Central to STS is the physical meaning of TS breaking order parameter (OP). In this paper, we discuss that the OP is a field-theoretic embodiment of the 'butterfly effect' (BE) -- the infinitely long dynamical memory that is definitive of chaos. We stress that the formulation of the corresponding effective theory for the OP would mark the inception of the first consistent physical theory of the BE. Such a theory, potentially a valuable tool in solving chaos-related problems, would parallel the well-established and successful field theoretic descriptions of superconductivity, ferromagentism and other known orders arising from the spontaneous breakdown of various symmetries of nature.</description>

      <title>Linear sigma model with quarks and Polyakov loop in rotation: phase diagrams, Tolman-Ehrenfest law and mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of rotation on the confining and chiral properties of QCD using the Polyakov-enhanced linear sigma model coupled to quarks. Working in the homogeneous approximation, we obtain the phase diagram at finite temperature, baryon density and angular frequency, taking into account the causality constraint enforced by the spectral boundary conditions at a cylindrical surface. We explicitly address various limits with respect to system size, angular frequency and chemical potential. We demonstrate that, in this model, the critical temperatures of both transitions diminish in response to the increasing rotation, being in contradiction with the first-principle lattice results. In the limit of large volume, the thermodynamics of the model is consistent with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also compute the mechanical characteristics of rotating plasma such as the moment of inertia and the $K_4$ shape coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exact static spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in generic six-derivative gravity (i.e., without assuming specific relations between the coupling constants). Using modified Schwarzschild coordinates, we systematically classify solutions through Frobenius expansions, determining their number of free parameters and confirming previously known cases, such as the regular solutions at the origin. Importantly, we identify novel solutions absent in four-derivative gravity, including those with (double-degenerate) extreme horizons (and their near-horizon limits) that exist without matter sources, which may indicate the existence of regular black holes. We also find asymptotically (anti-)de Sitter spacetimes, giving rise to an effective cosmological constant. The solutions can be classified into six main classes, and, when possible, we provide the description in standard Schwarzschild coordinates, in which they split into thirteen main solution classes.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes: Efficient and Highly Accurate Calculations with Recurrence-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss new recurrence-based methods for calculating the complex frequencies of the quasinormal modes of black holes. These methods are based on the Frobenius series solutions of the differential equation describing the linearized radial perturbations. Within the general method, we propose two approaches: the first involves calculating the series coefficients, while the second employs generalized continued fractions. Moreover, as a consequence of this analysis, we present a computationally efficient and convenient method that uses double convergence acceleration, consisting of the application of the Wynn algorithm to the approximants obtained from the Hill determinants, with the Leaver-Nollert-Zhidenko-like tail approximations taken into account. The latter is particularly important for stabilizing and enabling the calculations of modes with small real parts as well as higher overtones. The method demonstrates exceptionally high accuracy. We emphasize that Gaussian elimination is unnecessary in all of these calculations. We consider $D$-dimensional ($3&lt;D&lt;10$) Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes as concrete examples. Specifically, we calculate the quasinormal modes of the $(2+1)$-dimensional acoustic black hole (which is closely related to the five-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes), the electromagnetic-vector modes of the six-dimensional black holes and the scalar (gravitational tensor) modes in the seven-dimensional case. We believe that the methods presented here are applicable beyond the examples shown, also outside the domain of the black hole physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.00700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the semi-classical thermodynamics of two-dimensional de Sitter space ($\text{dS}_{2}$) in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled to conformal matter. We extend the quasi-local formalism of Brown and York to $\text{dS}_{2}$, where a timelike boundary is introduced in the static patch to uniquely define conserved charges, including quasi-local energy. The boundary divides the static patch into two systems, a cosmological system and a black hole system, the former being unstable under thermal fluctuations while the latter is stable. A semi-classical quasi-local first law is derived, where the Gibbons--Hawking entropy is replaced by the generalized entropy. In the microcanonical ensemble the generalized entropy is stationary. Further, we show the on-shell Euclidean microcanonical action of a causal diamond in semi-classical JT gravity equals minus the generalized entropy of the diamond, hence extremization of the entropy follows from minimizing the action. Thus, we provide a first principles derivation of the island rule for $U(1)$ symmetric $\text{dS}_{2}$ backgrounds, without invoking the replica trick. We discuss the implications of our findings for static patch de Sitter holography.</description>

      <title>When are Duality Defects Group-Theoretical?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum field theory with a finite abelian symmetry $G$ may be equipped with a non-invertible duality defect associated with gauging $G$. For certain $G$, duality defects admit an alternative construction where one starts with invertible symmetries with certain 't Hooft anomaly, and gauging a non-anomalous subgroup. This special type of duality defects are termed group theoretical. In this work, we determine when duality defects are group theoretical, among $G=\mathbb{Z}_N^{(0)}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N^{(1)}$ in $2$d and 4d quantum field theories, respectively. A duality defect is group theoretical if and only if its Symmetry TFT is a Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, and we argue that this is equivalent to a certain stability condition of the topological boundary conditions of the $G$ gauge theory. By solving the stability condition, we find that a $\mathbb{Z}_N^{(0)}$ duality defect in 2d is group theoretical if and only if $N$ is a perfect square, and under certain assumptions a $\mathbb{Z}_N^{(1)}$ duality defect in 4d is group theoretical if and only if $N=L^2 M$ where $-1$ is a quadratic residue of $M$. For these subset of $N$, we construct explicit topological manipulations that map the non-invertible duality defects to invertible defects. We also comment on the connection between our results and the recent discussion of obstruction to duality-preserving gapped phases.</description>

Abstract: Higher-derivative corrections in the AdS/CFT correspondence allow us to capture finer details of the dual CFT and to explore the holographic dictionary beyond the infinite N and strong coupling limits. Following an effective field theory approach, we investigate extremal AdS black hole solutions in five-dimensional supergravity with higher-derivative corrections. We provide a general analysis of near-horizon geometries of rotating extremal black holes and show how to obtain their corresponding charges and chemical potentials. We discuss the near-horizon solutions of the two-derivative theory, which we write using a novel parametrization that eases our computation of the higher-derivative corrections. The charges and thermodynamic properties of the black hole are computed while clarifying the ambiguities in their definitions. The charges and potentials turn out to satisfy a near-horizon version of the first law of thermodynamics whose interpretation we make clear. In the supersymmetric case, the results are shown to match the field theory prediction as well as previous results obtained from the on-shell action.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we use a perturbative approach to find the spectrum of non-relativistic strings in the String Newton-Cartan (SNC) AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ spacetime. We perturb the bosonic sector of the action around a BMN-like folded string solution in light-cone gauge. We find strong evidence that the theory is described by a combination of massive and massless free fields in an anti-de Sitter background by showing that interaction terms up to six scalars vanish after field redefinitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10837v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entropy dynamics of de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. The cosmological horizon in de Sitter spacetime, which limits the causally accessible region for an observer, exhibits thermal properties similar to a black hole event horizon. According to holographic principles, the entropy within a causally connected region is bounded by its surface area. However, this entropy bound is violated during the eternal phase of inflation. To address these violations from a quantum information perspective, we adopt a stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. Specifically, we analyze the Shannon entropy of the inflaton field's probability distribution, which mirrors the behavior of the entanglement entropy of a Hubble-sized region in stochastic inflation. Using the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we demonstrate a significant entropy behavior in de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-relativistic limit of 11-dimensional supergravity. This limit leads to a theory with an underlying membrane Newton-Cartan geometry. Consistency of the non-relativistic limit requires the imposition of constraints, requiring that certain bosonic and fermionic torsions and curvatures vanish. We investigate the implications of two versions of these constraints. In one version, we keep only 16 supersymmetry transformations, leading to a simple (purely bosonic) constraint structure but an unusual realisation of the supersymmetry algebra which does not close into diffeomorphisms. In the other, we keep all 32 supersymmetry transformations. This requires a complicated sequence of bosonic and fermionic constraints, eventually involving three derivatives of bosonic fields. We argue, with a linearised calculation, that this sequence of constraints terminates. Furthermore, we show that there exists a family of supersymmetric solutions satisfying these constraints, containing the non-relativistic limit of the M2 supergravity solution recently obtained by Lambert and Smith as a background relevant for non-relativistic holography.</description>

      <title>Reductions of GKZ Systems and Applications to Cosmological Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful approach to computing Feynman integrals or cosmological correlators is to consider them as solution to systems of differential equations. Often these can be chosen to be Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) systems. However, their naive construction introduces a significant amount of unnecessary complexity. In this paper we present an algorithm which allows for reducing these GKZ systems to smaller subsystems if a parameter associated to the GKZ systems is resonant. These simpler subsystems can then be solved separately resulting in solutions for the full system. The algorithm makes it possible to check when reductions happen and allows for finding the associated simpler solutions. While originating in the mathematical theory of D-modules analyzed via exact sequences of Euler-Koszul homologies, the algorithm can be used without knowledge of this framework. We motivate the need for such reduction techniques by considering cosmological correlators on an FRW space-time and solve the tree-level single-exchange correlator in this way. It turns out that this integral exemplifies an interesting relation between locality and the reduction of the differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to an almost bi-hermitian space with isometry and investigate integrability on its T-dualized one. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized space still admits integrability of the almost complex structures. We also observe that the form of H-flux is suitable for string compactification scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: Infrared causality and detectability of GW observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate time delays of wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-tensor effective field theories of gravity. The scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) couplings, being corrections of the lowest orders, can give rise to hairy black holes. By requiring infrared causality, we impose lower bounds on the cutoff scales of the theories. With these bounds, we further discuss the detectability of sGB gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Compared with the gravitational effective field theories that contain only the two tensor modes, adding extra degrees of freedom, such as adding a scalar, opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>

      <title>Poincare field theory for massless particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our main proposition is that field equations for all spins can be obtained from Casimir eigenvalue equations for Poincare group. We have already confirm that statement for massive scalar, spinor and vector fields in Ref.[1]. In the present article we are going to confirm this statement for massless vector, second and fourth rang tensor fields. In particular we will obtain Maxwell equations and Einstein equation in weak field approximation.
  As is well known, Wigner define a particles as irreducible representation of Poincare group [2,3]. But, as Weinberg noted in [4] irreducible representations for massless vector field with helicities $\pm 1$ do not exist. In the present article we will conform this statement for a wide class of massless fields. They are not Lorentz invariant since their Lorentz transformations have additional term in the form of gauge transformations. Such fields can appear in the theory only in the form which do not depend on corresponding gauge parameters. These forms are our equations of motion and they are by definition gauge invariant. So, the massless case is significantly different from massive one. In the end we will show that our approach can reproduce main contributions from well known articles with highest helicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that there is a strong interplay between quantum complexity and quantum chaos. In this work, we consider a new method to study geometric complexity for interacting non-Gaussian quantum mechanical systems to benchmark the quantum chaos in a well-known oscillator model. In particular, we study the circuit complexity for the unitary time-evolution operator of a non-Gaussian bosonic quantum mechanical system. Our results indicate that, within some limitations, geometric complexity can indeed be a good indicator of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Physical Running in Conformal Gravity and Higher Derivative Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the physical running of a general higher derivative scalar coupled to a nondynamical metric and of higher derivative Weyl invariant gravity with a dynamical metric in four dimensions. In both cases, we find that the physical running differs from the $\mu$-running of dimensional regularization because of infrared divergences which are present in amplitudes also at large momenta, differently from what happens in standard two derivative theories. We use the higher derivative scalar as a toy-model to elaborate on the properties of the conformal limit in relation to the trace anomaly. The physical running of higher derivative Weyl gravity, while different from the $\mu$-running, remains asymptotically free, suggesting that the model is a viable completion of Einstein's gravity, at least from the point of view of its renormalization group properties.</description>

Abstract: We determine the symmetries of four different theories: I) Galilean Electrodynamics (GED), II) GED coupled to 5 free static scalar fields, III) Galilean Yang-Mills (GYM), and IV) GYM coupled to 5 interacting scalar fields. We correct some old results in the literature, by finding that the symmetries of GED in a spacetime of generic dimension $d+1$ is always infinite dimensional, and in $3+1$ they correspond to the conformal Milne algebra extended by a spatial dilatation generator, which we call $D_x$. Finally, we comment on how these results fit into the framework of the non-relativistic AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We study the collinear factorization of off-shell scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (sYM) theory. These are constructed starting from six-dimensional N = (1,1) sYM, taking advantage of an available unconstrained spinor-helicity formalism combined with a unitarity-cut sewing procedure. After generalized dimensional reduction, their collinear behavior is dissected with assistance from the Method of Regions. We then construct off-shell splitting amplitudes directly using the same techniques, establishing equivalence to the amplitude analysis. The calculations are performed at one-loop order.</description>

      <title>Investigating (Non)-Integrability and Pulsating String in D3-Brane Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the (non)-integrability and chaotic dynamics of classical strings in the background of a D3-brane with a non-commutative parameter, within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using the Polyakov action, we derive the equations of motion and constraints for pulsating strings and analyze their stability through perturbation theory. In the large energy limit, the first-order perturbed equation simplifies to the P\"oschl-Teller equation, solvable via associated Legendre or hypergeometric functions, while numerical methods are employed for generic energy values. We demonstrate that the non-commutative parameter enhances chaotic behavior, as evidenced by the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE). Furthermore, we investigate the integrability of geodesic motion and identify two distinct string modes: capture and escape to infinity. Finally, we study pulsating strings in the deformed $(AdS_{3} \times S^{2})_{\varkappa}$ background, deriving dispersion relations for both short and long strings.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of point-particle dynamics on higher-spin backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the light-cone gauge formalism to study interactions of point particles with massless higher-spin fields. By analysing the light-cone consistency conditions at the subleading order in higher-spin fields, we find that no local interactions of point particles with chiral higher-spin fields are possible. Considering that chiral higher-spin theories form inevitable closed subsectors of any consistent massless higher-spin theories in flat space, this conclusion holds more generally, in particular, it applies to putative parity-invariant completions of chiral higher-spin theories. Besides that, we argue that our result implies that Riemannian geometry cannot be extended to spaces with non-trivial higher-spin fields, in particular, there is no higher-spin extension of space-time interval. In the present paper we focus on a case of a massless particle, while a more technical massive case will be analysed in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Topological invariant for holographic Weyl-$\mathrm Z_2$ semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of a topological phase transition can be demonstrated by a direct observation of a change in the topological invariant. For holographic topological semimetals, a topological Hamiltonian method needs to be employed to calculate the topological invariants due to the strong coupling nature of the system. We calculate the topological invariants for the holographic Weyl semimetal and the holographic Weyl-$\mathrm Z_2$ semimetal, which correspond to the chiral charge and the spin-Chern number, respectively. This is achieved by probing fermions within the system and deriving the topological Hamiltonian from the zero-frequency Green's function. In both cases, we have identified an effective band structure characterized by an infinite number of Weyl or $\mathrm Z_2$ nodes, a distinctive feature of holographic systems different from weakly coupled systems. The topological invariants of these nodes are computed numerically and found to be nonzero, thereby confirming the topologically nontrivial nature of these nodes.</description>

Abstract: Free electrons hopping on hyperbolic lattices embedded on a negatively curved space can foster (a) Dirac liquids, (b) Fermi liquids, and (c) flat bands, respectively characterized by a vanishing, constant, and divergent density of states near the half filling. From numerical self-consistent mean-field Hartree analyses, we show that nearest-neighbor Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions respectively give rise to charge-density-wave and antiferromagnetic orders featuring staggered patterns of average electronic density and magnetization in all these systems, when the hyperbolic tessellation is accomplished by periodic arrangements of even $p$-gons. Both quantum orders dynamically open mass gaps near the charge neutrality point via spontaneous symmetry breaking. Only on hyperbolic Dirac materials these orderings take place via quantum phase transitions (QPTs) beyond critical interactions, which however decrease with increasing curvature, showcasing curvature-induced weak-coupling QPTs. We present scaling of these masses with the corresponding interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>An algebraic correspondence between stochastic differential equations and the Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of complex systems, dynamics is often modeled in terms of a non-linear, stochastic, ordinary differential equation (SDE) with either an additive or a multiplicative Gaussian white noise. In addition to a well-established collection of results proving existence and uniqueness of the solutions, it is of particular relevance the explicit computation of expectation values and correlation functions, since they encode the key physical information of the system under investigation. A pragmatically efficient way to dig out these quantities consists of the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) formalism which establishes a correspondence between a large class of SDEs and suitably constructed field theories formulated by means of a path integral approach. Despite the effectiveness of this duality, there is no corresponding, mathematically rigorous proof of such correspondence. We address this issue using techniques proper of the algebraic approach to quantum field theories which is known to provide a valuable framework to discuss rigorously the path integral formulation of field theories as well as the solution theory both of ordinary and of partial, stochastic differential equations. In particular, working in this framework, we establish rigorously, albeit at the level of perturbation theory, a correspondence between correlation functions and expectation values computed either in the SDE or in the MSR formalism.</description>

We demonstrate non-trivial consistency relations among correlators, time-translation invariance, and agreement with Monte-Carlo results for thermal equilibrium in 3+1 dimensions by employing our stabilized complex Langevin method. Our work sets the stage to extract real-time observables, relevant to quark-gluon plasma physics within a first-principles real-time framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider general linear gauge theory, with independent solder form and connection. These spaces have both torsion and nonmetricity. We show that the Cartan structure equations together with the defining equation for nonmetricity allow the mixed symmetry components of nonmetricity to be absorbed into an altered torsion tensor. Field redefinitions reduce the structure equations to those of Poincare gauge theory, with local Lorentz symmetry and metric compatibility. In order to allow recovery the original torsion and nonmetric fields, we replace the definition of nonmetricity by an additional structure equation and demand integrability of the extended system. We show that the maximal Lie algebra compatible with the enlarged set is isomorphic to the conformal Lie algebra. From this Lorentzian conformal geometry, we establish that the difference between the field strength of special conformal transformations and the torsion and is given by the mixed symmetry nonmetricity of an equivalent asymmetric system.</description>

      <title>An analog of topological entanglement entropy for mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information ("co(QCMI)") as a diagnostic of topological order in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is non-increasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure state transition between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the 2d toric code decohered by onsite bit/phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is non-zero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the R\'enyi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide non-trivial consistency checks for our conjecture. We use TMC to also calculate the universal scaling dimension of the anyon-condensation order parameter at this transition.</description>

Abstract: We study the properties of gluon plasma subjected to a weak acceleration using first-principle numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We use the Luttinger (Tolman-Ehrenfest) correspondence between temperature gradient and gravitational field to impose acceleration in imaginary time formalism. Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to $a \simeq 16$ MeV drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, our results imply that the acceleration, if present, may also inhibit the detection of the thermodynamic phase transition from quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Axion-photon conversion down to the nonrelativistic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a magnetic field, axions can convert into photons and vice versa. The phenomenology of the conversion is captured by a system of two coupled Klein-Gordon equations, which, assuming that the axion is relativistic, is usually recast into a pair of first-order Schr\"odinger-like equations. In such a limit, focusing on a constant magnetic field and plasma frequency, the equations admit an exact analytic solution. The relativistic limit significantly simplifies the calculations and, therefore, it is widely used in phenomenological applications. In this work, we discuss how to evaluate the axion-photon system evolution without relying on such relativistic approximation. In particular, we give an exact analytical solution, valid for any axion energy, in the case that both the magnetic field and plasma frequency are constant. Moreover, we devise an analytic perturbative expansion that allows for tracking the conversion probability in a slightly inhomogeneous magnetic field or plasma frequency, whose characteristic scale of variation is much larger than the typical axion-photon oscillation length. Finally, we discuss a case of resonant axion-photon conversion giving useful simplified formulae that might be directly applied to dark matter axions converting in neutron star magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Particle production rate for a dynamical system using the path integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the particle creation rate in a dynamical (Vaidya) spacetime using Feynman's path integral formalism within the framework of the effective action approach. We examine three distinct cases involving the following mass functions, each representing dynamical geometries: (i) $m(v,r)=\mu v$, (ii) $m(v,r)=\mu v +\nu r$, and (iii) $m(v,r)=\mu v -\frac{\mu^2 v^2}{2r}$, where $\mu$ and $\nu$ are positive constants that satisfy all known energy conditions. We analyze particle production rates in the region of dynamical horizons, revealing an initial high rate followed by a rapid decline in all cases. Additionally, we explore the thermodynamic properties by calculating the surface gravity and corresponding Hayward-Kodama temperatures for each scenario. Graphical representations show the variation of surface gravity over time for the three cases, offering insights into the system's thermodynamic evolution. Our research investigates the connection between background geometry and the particle creation process, placing it within the broader context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The non-stationary nature of Vaidya geometry is highlighted as a valuable framework for examining the dynamic aspects of particle creation. This in-depth analysis enhances our understanding of quantum processes in curved spacetime and may offer insights relevant to thermodynamics and studies of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Instability of nonlinear scalar field on strongly charged asymptotically AdS black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conformally invariant scalar equation permits the Robin boundary condition at infinity of asymptotically-AdS spacetimes. We show how the dynamics of conformal cubic scalar field on the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-anti-de Sitter background depend on the black hole size, charge, and choice of the boundary condition. We study the whole range of admissible charges, including the extremal case. In particular, we observe the transition in stability of the field for large black holes at the specific critical value of the charge. Similarities between Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr black hole let us suspect that a similar effect may also occur in rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>A ${\mathbb{CP}}^2$ SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An extension of the Standard Model is proposed, where the Higgs field is valued in the complex projective plane ${\mathbb{CP}}^2$, rather than ${\mathbb{C}}^2$. Its geometry is consistent with $U(2) \simeq (SU(2) \times U(1))/ \mathbb{Z}_2$ electroweak gauge symmetry. The leading terms in the Lagrangian, beyond those of the Standard Model, are much more tightly constrained than in general SMEFTs, and the custodial $SO(4)$ symmetry of the Higgs sector is mildly broken. The predicted tree-level deviations from Standard Model phenomenology depend on a single large mass parameter $M$. Current experimental data imply that $M$ is a few TeV or larger.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Local Black Hole Horizons: Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the early literature on black holes focused on event horizons, subsequently it was realized that their teleological nature makes them unsuitable for many physical applications both in classical and quantum gravity. Therefore, over the past two decades, event horizons have been steadily replaced by quasi-local horizons which do not suffer from teleology. In numerical simulations event horizons can be located as an `after thought' only after the entire space-time has been constructed. By contrast, quasi-local horizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing powerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics from the numerical outputs. They also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen insights. For example, for event horizons we only have a qualitative result that their area cannot decrease, while for quasi-local horizons the increase in the area during a dynamical phase is quantitatively related to local physical processes at the horizon. In binary black hole mergers, there are interesting correlations between observables associated with quasi-local horizons and those defined at future null infinity. Finally, the quantum Hawking process is naturally described as formation and evaporation of a quasi-local horizon. This review focuses on the dynamical aspects of quasi-local horizons in classical general relativity, emphasizing recent results and ongoing research.</description>

      <title>The correspondence of generalised entropic cosmology theory with $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ modified gravity and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compare FLRW equations obtained in entropic gravity with those in modified gravity theories. It is found the correspondence of $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravities and general entropic gravity. We regard the $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravity theories as effective local theories corresponding to the entropic gravity theories and we investigate the gravitational waves. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$. It is interesting that in the case of the Tsallis entropic cosmology, the gravitational coupling becomes small or large, which may suppress or enhance the emission of the gravitational wave.</description>
