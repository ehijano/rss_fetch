      <title>Building a Recommendation System Using Amazon Product Co-Purchasing Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project develops an online, inductive recommendation system for newly listed products on e-commerce platforms, focusing on suggesting relevant new items to customers as they purchase other products. Using the Amazon Product Co-Purchasing Network Metadata dataset, we construct a co-purchasing graph where nodes represent products and edges capture co-purchasing relationships. To address the challenge of recommending new products with limited information, we apply a modified GraphSAGE method for link prediction. This inductive approach leverages both product features and the existing co-purchasing graph structure to predict potential co-purchasing relationships, enabling the model to generalize to unseen products. As an online method, it updates in real time, making it scalable and adaptive to evolving product catalogs. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline algorithms in predicting relevant product links, offering a promising solution for enhancing the relevance of new product recommendations in e-commerce environments.

      <title>Random Hyperbolic Graphs with Arbitrary Mesoscale Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world networks exhibit universal structural properties such as sparsity, small-worldness, heterogeneous degree distributions, high clustering, and community structures. Geometric network models, particularly Random Hyperbolic Graphs (RHGs), effectively capture many of these features by embedding nodes in a latent similarity space. However, networks are often characterized by specific connectivity patterns between groups of nodes -- i.e. communities -- that are not geometric, in the sense that the dissimilarity between groups do not obey the triangle inequality. Structuring connections only based on the interplay of similarity and popularity thus poses fundamental limitations on the mesoscale structure of the networks that RHGs can generate. To address this limitation, we introduce the Random Hyperbolic Block Model (RHBM), which extends RHGs by incorporating block structures within a maximum-entropy framework. We demonstrate the advantages of the RHBM through synthetic network analyses, highlighting its ability to preserve community structures where purely geometric models fail. Our findings emphasize the importance of latent geometry in network modeling while addressing its limitations in controlling mesoscale mixing patterns.</description>

      <title>Collective Intelligence Outperforms Individual Talent: A Case Study in League of Legends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaming environments are popular testbeds for studying human interactions and behaviors in complex artificial intelligence systems. Particularly, in multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, individuals collaborate in virtual environments of high realism that involves real-time strategic decision-making and trade-offs on resource management, information collection and sharing, team synergy and collective dynamics. This paper explores whether collective intelligence, emerging from cooperative behaviours exhibited by a group of individuals, who are not necessarily skillful but effectively engage in collaborative problem-solving tasks, exceeds individual intelligence observed within skillful individuals. This is shown via a case study in League of Legends, using machine learning algorithms and statistical methods applied to large-scale data collected for the same purpose. By modelling systematically game-specific metrics but also new game-agnostic topological and graph spectra measures of cooperative interactions, we demonstrate compelling insights about the superior performance of collective intelligence.</description>

      <title>Detecting Patterns of Interaction in Temporal Hypergraphs via Edge Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding densely connected subsets of vertices in an unsupervised setting, called clustering or community detection, is one of the fundamental problems in network science. The edge clustering approach instead detects communities by clustering the edges of the graph and then assigning a vertex to a community if it has at least one edge in that community, thereby allowing for overlapping clusters of vertices. We apply the idea behind edge clustering to temporal hypergraphs, an extension of a graph where a single edge can contain any number of vertices and each edge has a timestamp. Extending to hypergraphs allows for many different patterns of interaction between edges, and by defining a suitable structural similarity function, our edge clustering algorithm can find clusters of these patterns. We test the algorithm with three structural similarity functions on a large collaboration hypergraph, and find intuitive cluster structures that could prove useful for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Sampling nodes and hyperedges via random walks on large hypergraphs</title>

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a fundamental framework for representing complex systems involving interactions among three or more entities. As empirical hypergraphs grow in size, characterizing their structural properties becomes increasingly challenging due to computational complexity and, in some cases, restricted access to complete data, requiring efficient sampling methods. Random walks offer a practical approach to hypergraph sampling, as they rely solely on local neighborhood information from nodes and hyperedges. In this study, we investigate methods for simultaneously sampling nodes and hyperedges via random walks on large hypergraphs. First, we compare three existing random walks in the context of hypergraph sampling and identify an advantage of the so-called higher-order random walk. Second, by extending an established technique for graphs to the case of hypergraphs, we present a non-backtracking variant of the higher-order random walk. We derive theoretical results on estimators based on the non-backtracking higher-order random walk and validate them through numerical simulations on large empirical hypergraphs. Third, we apply the non-backtracking higher-order random walk to a large hypergraph of co-authorships indexed in the OpenAlex database, where full access to the data is not readily available. Despite the relatively small sample size, our estimates largely align with previous findings on author productivity, team size, and the prevalence of open-access publications. Our findings contribute to the development of analysis methods for large hypergraphs, offering insights into sampling strategies and estimation techniques applicable to real-world complex systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Clustering for Directed Graphs via Likelihood Estimation on Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning with broad real-world applications. While spectral clustering methods for undirected graphs are well-established and guided by a minimum cut optimization consensus, their extension to directed graphs remains relatively underexplored due to the additional complexity introduced by edge directions. In this paper, we leverage statistical inference on stochastic block models to guide the development of a spectral clustering algorithm for directed graphs. Specifically, we study the maximum likelihood estimation under a widely used directed stochastic block model, and derive a global objective function that aligns with the underlying community structure. We further establish a theoretical upper bound on the misclustering error of its spectral relaxation, and based on this relaxation, introduce a novel, self-adaptive spectral clustering method for directed graphs. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for the Network Scale-Up Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemiologists and social scientists have used the Network Scale-Up Method (NSUM) for over thirty years to estimate the size of a hidden sub-population within a social network. This method involves querying a subset of network nodes about the number of their neighbours belonging to the hidden sub-population. In general, NSUM assumes that the social network topology and the hidden sub-population distribution are well-behaved; hence, the NSUM estimate is close to the actual value. However, bounds on NSUM estimation errors have not been analytically proven. This paper provides analytical bounds on the error incurred by the two most popular NSUM estimators. These bounds assume that the queried nodes accurately provide their degree and the number of neighbors belonging to the hidden population. Our key findings are twofold. First, we show that when an adversary designs the network and places the hidden sub-population, then the estimate can be a factor of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ off from the real value (in a network with $n$ nodes). Second, we also prove error bounds when the underlying network is randomly generated, showing that a small constant factor can be achieved with high probability using samples of logarithmic size $O(\log{n})$. We present improved analytical bounds for Erdos-Renyi and Scale-Free networks. Our theoretical analysis is supported by an extensive set of numerical experiments designed to determine the effect of the sample size on the accuracy of the estimates in both synthetic and real networks.</description>

      <title>When Heterophily Meets Heterogeneity: Challenges and a New Large-Scale Graph Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph mining has become crucial in fields such as social science, finance, and cybersecurity. Many large-scale real-world networks exhibit both heterogeneity, where multiple node and edge types exist in the graph, and heterophily, where connected nodes may have dissimilar labels and attributes. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on either heterophilic homogeneous graphs or homophilic heterogeneous graphs, leaving a significant gap in understanding how models perform on graphs with both heterogeneity and heterophily. To bridge this gap, we introduce H2GB, a large-scale node-classification graph benchmark that brings together the complexities of both the heterophily and heterogeneity properties of real-world graphs. H2GB encompasses 9 real-world datasets spanning 5 diverse domains, 28 baseline models, and a unified benchmarking library with a standardized data loader, evaluator, unified modeling framework, and an extensible framework for reproducibility. We establish a standardized workflow supporting both model selection and development, enabling researchers to easily benchmark graph learning methods. Extensive experiments across 28 baselines reveal that current methods struggle with heterophilic and heterogeneous graphs, underscoring the need for improved approaches. Finally, we present a new variant of the model, H2G-former, developed following our standardized workflow, that excels at this challenging benchmark. Both the benchmark and the framework are publicly available at Github and PyPI, with documentation hosted at https://junhongmit.github.io/H2GB.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>The epistemic dimension of algorithmic fairness: assessing its impact in innovation diffusion and fair policy making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is an expanding field that addresses a range of discrimination issues associated with algorithmic processes. However, most works in the literature focus on analyzing it only from an ethical perspective, focusing on moral principles and values that should be considered in the design and evaluation of algorithms, while disregarding the epistemic dimension related to knowledge transmission and validation. However, this aspect of algorithmic fairness should also be included in the debate, as it is crucial to introduce a specific type of harm: an individual may be systematically excluded from the dissemination of knowledge due to the attribution of a credibility deficit/excess. In this work, we specifically focus on characterizing and analyzing the impact of this credibility deficit or excess on the diffusion of innovations on a societal scale, a phenomenon driven by individual attitudes and social interactions, and also by the strength of mutual connections. Indeed, discrimination might shape the latter, ultimately modifying how innovations spread within the network. In this light, to incorporate, also from a formal point of view, the epistemic dimension in innovation diffusion models becomes paramount, especially if these models are intended to support fair policy design. For these reasons, we formalize the epistemic properties of a social environment, by extending the well-established Linear Threshold Model (LTM) in an epistemic direction to show the impact of epistemic biases in innovation diffusion. Focusing on the impact of epistemic bias in both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios featuring optimal fostering policies, our results shed light on the pivotal role the epistemic dimension might have in the debate of algorithmic fairness in decision-making.</description>
