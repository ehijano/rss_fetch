      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>

      <title>Winding number on 3D lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple numerical method which computes an approximate value of the winding number of a mapping from 3D torus~$T^3$ to the unitary group~$U(N)$, when $T^3$ is approximated by discrete lattice points. Our method consists of a ``tree-level improved'' discretization of the winding number and the gradient flow associated with an ``over-improved'' lattice action. By employing a one-parameter family of mappings from $T^3$ to $SU(2)$ with known winding numbers, we demonstrate that the method works quite well even for coarse lattices, reproducing integer winding numbers in a good accuracy. Our method can trivially be generalized to the case of higher-dimensional tori.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of the dimensionally reduced 3D Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 3D Ising model in the infinite volume limit $N_{x,y,z}\to\infty$ by means of numerical simulations. We determine $T_c$ as well as the critical exponents $\beta,\gamma$ and $\nu$, based on finite-size scaling and histogram reweighting techniques. In addition, we study a ``dimensionally reduced'' scenario where $N_z$ is kept fixed (e.g. at 2, 4, 8), while the limit $N_{x,y}\to\infty$ is taken. For each fixed $N_z$ we determine $T_c$ as well as $\beta,\gamma,\nu$. For $T_c$ we find a smooth transition curve which connects the well known critical temperatures of the 2D and the 3D Ising model. Regarding $\beta,\gamma,\nu$ our data suggest that the ``dimensionally reduced'' Ising model is in the same universality class as the 2D Ising model, regardless of $N_z$.</description>

      <title>Block Lanczos for lattice QCD spectroscopy and matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Roy-Steiner equation analysis of $\pi K$ scattering at unphysical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a rigorous analysis of the $\pi K$ scattering at an unphysical pion mass $391~$MeV using the Roy-Steiner equations, which satisfy unitarity, analyticity and crossing symmetry, for the first time. Stable solutions of the Roy-Steiner equations with different quantum numbers of isospin and angular momentum are obtained in the elastic energy region, by taking inputs from the $\pi K$ lattice data in the inelastic region, the lattice data from the crossed $\pi\pi \to K\bar{K}$ channels, the masses of $f_0(500)$ and $K^*$ at the same pion mass from previous study, and the Regge model. Predictions on the elastic $\pi K$ scattering phase shifts and the $K_0^*(700)$ pole content are made. Contrary to the virtual pole scenario obtained using the $K$-matrix method in the literature, we find that lightest strange scalar meson $K_0^*(700)$ remains a broad resonance at $M_\pi=391~$MeV. The cross-channel dynamics is found to play a crucial role in deriving the proper pole position.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at $\theta =\pi$ from imaginary $\theta$ simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory at $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it is the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are available. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$ term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, where the sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$. We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to be used in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the topological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and provide an evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low temperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature. This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Regulating chiral gauge theory at $\theta=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that a proposal to nonperturbatively regulate chiral gauge theories on the boundary of a five-dimensional lattice will fail due to the existence of exact $U(1)$ symmetries not present in the target theories. A related observation is that in the presence of gauge fields with nontrivial topology, fermion zeromodes will appear embedded in the extra dimension which do not decouple from the four-dimensional world. Here we show that these problems can be evaded by simulating the theory in the trivial topological sector of the boundary gauge fields. A regulated version of the Standard Model using this approach in the continuum and large volume limits is expected to appear as if it possessed a Peccei-Quinn mechanism for relaxing $\theta_\text{QCD}$ to zero, without there being an axion in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>In-medium mass shift of two-flavored heavy mesons, $B_c$, $B^*_c$, $B_s$, $B^*_s$, $D_s$ and $D^*_s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we estimate the in-medium mass shift of the two-flavored heavy mesons $B_c, B_c^*, B_s, B_s^*, D_s$ and $D_s^*$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The estimates are made by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies. The enhanced excitations of intermediate state heavy-light mesons in symmetric nuclear matter are the origin of their negative mass shift. This negative mass shift may be regarded as a signature of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in an empirical sense because the origin of the negative mass shift in the study is not directly related to the chiral symmetry mechanism. Our results show that the magnitude of the mass shift for the $B_c$ meson ($\bar{b} c$ or $b \bar{c}$) is larger than those of the $\eta_c (\bar{c} c)$ and $\eta_b (\bar{b} b)$, different from a naive expectation that it would be in between them. While, that of the $B_c^*$ shows the in between of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We observe that the lighter vector meson excitation in each meson self-energy gives a dominant contribution for the corresponding meson mass shift, $B_c, B_s,$ and $D_s$.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac fields in an expanding universe: dynamical condensates and particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of particle production for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes is crucial to understand the large-scale structure of a universe from an inflationary epoch. In contrast to the free and fixed-background case, the production of particles with strong interactions and back reaction is not completely understood, especially in situations that require going beyond perturbation theory. In this work, we present advances in this direction by focusing on a self-interacting field theory of Dirac fermions in an expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By using a Hamiltonian lattice regularization with continuous conformal time and rescaled fields, this model becomes amenable to either a cold-atom analogue-gravity quantum simulation, or a dynamical variational approach. Leveraging a family of variational fermionic Gaussian states, we investigate how dynamical mass generation and the formation of fermion condensates associated to certain broken symmetries modify some well-known results of the free field theory. In particular, we study how the non-perturbative condensates arise and, more importantly, how their real-time evolution has an impact on particle production. Depending on the Hubble expansion rate, we find an interesting interplay of interactions and particle production, including a non-trivial back reaction on the condensates and a parity-breaking spectrum of produced particles.</description>
