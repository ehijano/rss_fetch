      <title>MOT: A Mixture of Actors Reinforcement Learning Method by Optimal Transport for Algorithmic Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading refers to executing buy and sell orders for specific assets based on automatically identified trading opportunities. Strategies based on reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing algorithmic trading problems. However, the trading patterns differ among market conditions due to shifted distribution data. Ignoring multiple patterns in the data will undermine the performance of RL. In this paper, we propose MOT,which designs multiple actors with disentangled representation learning to model the different patterns of the market. Furthermore, we incorporate the Optimal Transport (OT) algorithm to allocate samples to the appropriate actor by introducing a regularization loss term. Additionally, we propose Pretrain Module to facilitate imitation learning by aligning the outputs of actors with expert strategy and better balance the exploration and exploitation of RL. Experimental results on real futures market data demonstrate that MOT exhibits excellent profit capabilities while balancing risks. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the components of MOT.</description>

      <title>Indian Stock Market Prediction using Augmented Financial Intelligence ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents price prediction models using Machine Learning algorithms augmented with Superforecasters predictions, aimed at enhancing investment decisions. Five Machine Learning models are built, including Bidirectional LSTM, ARIMA, a combination of CNN and LSTM, GRU, and a model built using LSTM and GRU algorithms. The models are evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error to determine their predictive accuracy. Additionally, the paper suggests incorporating human intelligence by identifying Superforecasters and tracking their predictions to anticipate unpredictable shifts or changes in stock prices . The predictions made by these users can further enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions when combined with Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. Predicting the price of any commodity can be a significant task but predicting the price of a stock in the stock market deals with much more uncertainty. Recognising the limited knowledge and exposure to stocks among certain investors, this paper proposes price prediction models using Machine Learning algorithms. In this work, five Machine learning models are built using Bidirectional LSTM, ARIMA, a combination of CNN and LSTM, GRU and the last one is built using LSTM and GRU algorithms. Later these models are assessed using MAE scores to find which model is predicting with the highest accuracy. In addition to this, this paper also suggests the use of human intelligence to closely predict the shift in price patterns in the stock market The main goal is to identify Superforecasters and track their predictions to anticipate unpredictable shifts or changes in stock prices. By leveraging the combined power of Machine Learning and the Human Intelligence, predictive accuracy can be significantly increased.</description>

      <title>Insider trading in discrete time Kyle games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new discrete time version of Kyle's (1985) classic model of insider trading, formulated as a generalised extensive form game. The model has three kinds of traders: an insider, random noise traders, and a market maker. The insider aims to exploit her informational advantage and maximise expected profits while the market maker observes the total order flow and sets prices accordingly.
  First, we show how the multi-period model with finitely many pure strategies can be reduced to a (static) social system in the sense of Debreu (1952) and prove the existence of a sequential Kyle equilibrium, following Kreps and Wilson (1982). This works for any probability distribution with finite support of the noise trader's demand and the true value, and for any finite information flow of the insider. In contrast to Kyle (1985) with normal distributions, equilibria exist in general only in mixed strategies and not in pure strategies.
  In the single-period model we establish bounds for the insider's strategy in equilibrium. Finally, we prove the existence of an equilibrium for the game with a continuum of actions, by considering an approximating sequence of games with finitely many actions. Because of the lack of compactness of the set of measurable price functions, standard infinite-dimensional fixed point theorems are not applicable.</description>
