      <title>Parity-deformed $su(2)$ and $so(3)$ Algebras: a Basis for Quantum Optics and Quantum Communications Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Having in mind the significance of parity (reflection) in various areas of physics, the single-mode and two-mode Wigner algebras are considered adding to them a reflection operator. The associated deformed $su(2)$ algebra, $su_{\nu}(2)$, and the deformed $so(3)$ algebra, $so_{\nu}(3)$, are constructed for the widely used Jordan-Schwinger and Holstein-Primakoff realizations, commenting on various aspects and ingredients of the formalism for both single-mode and two-mode cases. Finally, in this framework the parity-deformed $so_{\nu}(3)$ representation is analyzed, due to its potential application in the study of qubit and qutrit systems.</description>

      <title>Platonic quasi-normal modes expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastic wave manipulation using large arrays of resonators is driving the need for advanced simulation and optimization methods. To address this we introduce and explore a robust framework for wave control: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs). Specifically we consider the problem for thin elastic plates, where the Green's function formalism is well known and readily exploited to solve multiple scattering problems. By studying the associated nonlinear eigenvalue problem we derive a dispersive QNM expansion, providing a reduced-order model for efficient forced response computations which reveals physical insight into the resonant mode excitation. Furthermore, we derive eigenvalue sensitivities with respect to resonator parameters and apply a gradient-based optimization to design quasi-bound states in the continuum and position eigenfrequencies precisely in the complex plane. Scattering simulations validate our approach in structures such as graded line arrays and quasi-crystals. Drawing on QNM concepts from electromagnetism we demonstrate significant advances in elastic metamaterials, highlighting their potential for tailored wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Outliers for deformed inhomogeneous random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous random matrices with a non-trivial variance profile determined by a symmetric stochastic matrix and with independent symmetrically sub-Gaussian entries up to Hermitian symmetry, include many prominent examples, such as remarkable sparse Wigner matrices and random band matrices in dimension d, and have been of great interest recently. The maximum of entry variances as a natural proxy of sparsity is both a key feature and a significant obstacle. In this paper, we study low-rank additive perturbations of such random matrices, and establish a sharp BBP phase transition for extreme eigenvalues at the level of law of large numbers. Under suitable conditions on the variance profile and the finite-rank perturbation, we also establish the fluctuations of spectral outliers that may be characterized by the general inhomogeneous random matrices. This reveals the strong non-universality phenomena, which may depend on eigenvectors, sparsity or geometric structure. Our proofs rely on ribbon graph expansions, upper bounds for diagram functions, large moment estimates and counting of typical diagrams.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the uniqueness for an inverse problem of determining a matrix coefficient $P(x)$ of a system of evolution equations $\sigma \ppp_t u = \ppp_x^2 u(t,x) - P(x) u(t,x)$ for $0&lt;x&lt;\ell$ and $0&lt;t&lt;T$, where $\ell&gt;0$ and $T&gt;0$ are arbitrarily given. The uniqueness results assert that two solutions have the same Cauchy data at $x=0$ over $(0,T)$ and the same initial value or the final value which is positive on $[0,\ell]$, then the zeroth-order coefficient is uniquely determined on $[0,\ell]$. The uniqueness for inverse coefficient problem for a system of evolution equations without boundary conditions over the whole boundary is an open problem even in the one-dimension in the case where only initial value is given as spatial data. Moreover, in the case of the zero initial condition, we prove the uniqueness in the half of the spatial interval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a link between the virial theorem in functional analysis and the method of multipliers in theory of partial differential equations. After giving a physical insight into the techniques, we show how to use them to deduce the absence of eigenvalues and other spectral properties of electromagnetic quantum Hamiltonians. We focus on our recent developments in non-self-adjoint settings, namely on Schroedinger operators with matrix-valued potentials, relativistic operators of Pauli and Dirac types, and complex Robin boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent DKP hierarchy and its dispersionless limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the free fermions technique and bosonization rules we introduce the multicomponent DKP hierarchy as a generating bilinear integral equation for the tau-function. A number of bilinear equations of the Hirota-Miwa type are obtained as its corollaries. We also consider the dispersionless version of the hierarchy as a set of nonlinear differential equations for the dispersionless limit of logarithm of the tau-function (the $F$-function). We show that there is an elliptic curve built in the structure of the hierarchy, with the elliptic modulus being a dynamical variable. This curve can be uniformized by elliptic functions, and in the elliptic parametrization many dispersionless equations of the Hirota-Miwa type become equivalent to a single equation having a nice form.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of discrete solitons in the fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with the quasi-Riesz derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate a fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (FDNLS) equation based on an appropriately modified definition of the Riesz fractional derivative, which is characterized by its L\'{e}vy index (LI). This FDNLS equation represents a novel discrete system, in which the nearest-neighbor coupling is combined with long-range interactions, that decay as the inverse square of the separation between lattice sites. The system may be realized as an array of parallel quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates composed of atoms or small molecules carrying, respectively, a permanent magnetic or electric dipole moment. The dispersion relation (DR) for lattice waves and the corresponding propagation band in the system's linear spectrum are found in an exact form for all values of LI. The DR is consistent with the continuum limit, differing in the range of wavenumbers. Formation of single-site and two-site discrete solitons is explored, starting from the anti-continuum limit and continuing the analysis in the numerical form up to the existence boundary of the discrete solitons. Stability of the solitons is identified in terms of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and verified in direct simulations. Mobility of the discrete solitons is considered too, by means of an estimate of the system's Peierls-Nabarro potential barrier, and with the help of direct simulations. Collisions between persistently moving discrete solitons are also studied.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Lightcones from Quantum SO(2,1) Conformal Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Five new families of noncommutative lightcones in 2+1 dimensions are presented as the quantizations of the inequivalent Poisson homogeneous structures that emerge when the lightcone is constructed as a homogeneous space of the SO(2,1) conformal group. Each of these noncommutative lightcones maintains covariance under the action of the respective quantum deformation of the SO(2,1) conformal group. We discuss the role played by SO(2,1) automorphisms in the classification of inequivalent Poisson homogeneous lightcones, as well as the geometric aspects of this construction. The localization properties of the novel quantum lightcones are analyzed and shown to be deeply connected with the geometric features of the Poisson homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed-dimensional beam-shell-solid couplings in linear Cosserat continua via tangential differential calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to the coupling of mixed-dimensional continua by employing the mathematically enriched linear Cosserat micropolar model. The kinematical reduction of the model to lower dimensional domains leaves its fundamental degrees of freedom intact. Consequently, the degrees of freedom intrinsically agree even at the interface with a domain of a different dimensionality. Thus, this approach circumvents the need for intermediate finite elements or mortar methods. We introduce the derivations of all models of various dimensions using tangential differential calculus. The coupling itself is then achieved by defining a mixed-dimensional action functional with consistent Sobolev trace operators. Finally, we present numerical examples involving a three-dimensional silicone-rubber block reinforced with a curved graphite shell on its lower surface, a three-dimensional silver block reinforced with a graphite plate and beams, and lastly, intersecting silver shells reinforced with graphite beams.</description>

      <title>Random ordinate method for mitigating the ray effect in radiative transport equation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is the most widely used velocity discretization method for simulating the radiative transport equation. The ray effect stands as a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests displaying the ray effect, we observe low regularity in velocity within the solution. To address this issue, we propose a random ordinate method (ROM) to mitigate the ray effect. Compared with other strategies proposed in the literature for mitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) the computational cost is comparable to DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to existing code based on DOM; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of the problem setup. Analytical results are presented for the convergence orders of the error and bias, and numerical tests demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time and topology in 1D $O(N)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the relaxation time (inverse spectral gap) of the one dimensional $O(N)$ model, for all $N$ and with two types of boundary conditions. We see how its low temperature asymptotic behavior is affected by the topology. The combination of the space dimension, which here is always 1, the boundary condition (free or periodic), and the spin state $S^{N-1}$, determines the existence or absence of non-trivial homotopy classes in some discrete version. Such non-trivial topology reflects in bottlenecks of the dynamics, creating metastable states that the system exits at exponential times; while when only one homotopy class exists the relaxation time depends polynomially on the temperature. We prove in the one dimensional case that, indeed, the relaxation time is a proxy to the model's topological properties via the exponential/polynomial dependence on the temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the existence and stability dynamics of self-steepening optical solitons in a periodic PT-symmetric potential.
  We show that self-steepening solitons of the modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger (MNLS) equation undergo a position shift and amplitude increase during their evolution in the MNLS equation. The stabilization of solitons by an external potential is a challenging issue. This study demonstrates that the suppression of both the amplitude increase and the position shift of self-steepening solitons can be achieved by adding a periodic PT-symmetric potential to the MNLS equation.</description>

Abstract: We study a coarse-graining procedure for quantum cellular automata on hypercubic lattices that consists in grouping neighboring cells into tiles and selecting a subspace within each tile. This is done in such a way that multiple evolution steps applied to this subspace can be viewed as a single evolution step of a new quantum cellular automaton, whose cells are the subspaces themselves. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalizability and use it to investigate the renormalization flow of cellular automata on a line, where the cells are qubits and the tiles are composed of two neighboring cells. The problem is exhaustively solved, and the fixed points of the renormalization flow are highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates city dynamics employing a nonextensive diffusion equation suited for addressing diffusion within a fractal medium, where the nonadditive parameter, $q$, plays a relevant role. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in determining the relation between the fractal dimension of the city, the allometric exponent and $q$, and elucidating the stationary phase of urban evolution. The dynamic methodology facilitates the correlation of the fractal dimension with both the entropic index and the urban scaling exponent identified in data analyses. The results reveal that the scaling behaviour observed in cities aligns with the fractal dimension measured through independent methods. Moreover, the interpretation of these findings underscores the intimate connection between the fractal dimension and social interactions within the urban context. This research contributes to a deeper comprehension of the intricate interplay between human behaviour, urban dynamics, and the underlying fractal nature of cities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct integrable chiral cosmological models with two scalar fields and potentials represented in terms of hyperbolic functions. Using the conformal transformation of the metric and the corresponding models with induced gravity terms, we obtain the general solutions in the spatially flat, open and closed Friedmann universes and the corresponding integrals of motion. The obtained general solutions can be written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions of the conformal time.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits. The algorithm computes the expectation value of any observable for any circuit, with a small average error over input states drawn from an ensemble (e.g. the computational basis). Our approach is based upon the intuition that noise exponentially damps non-local correlations relative to local correlations. This enables one to classically simulate a noisy quantum circuit by only keeping track of the dynamics of local quantum information. Our algorithm also enables sampling from the output distribution of a circuit in quasi-polynomial time, so long as the distribution anti-concentrates. A number of practical implications are discussed, including a fundamental limit on the efficacy of noise mitigation strategies: any quantum circuit for which error mitigation is efficient must be classically simulable.</description>

      <title>The BRST quantisation of chiral BMS-like field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BMS$_3$ Lie algebra belongs to a one-parameter family of Lie algebras obtained by centrally extending abelian extensions of the Witt algebra by a tensor density representation. In this paper we call such Lie algebras $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$, with BMS$_3$ corresponding to the universal central extension of $\lambda = -1$. We construct the BRST complex for $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ in two different ways: one in the language of semi-infinite cohomology and the other using the formalism of vertex operator algebras. We pay particular attention to the case of BMS$_3$ and discuss some natural field-theoretical realisations. We prove two theorems about the BRST cohomology of $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$. The first is the construction of a quasi-isomorphic embedding of the chiral sector of any Virasoro string as a $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ string. The second is the isomorphism (as Batalin--Vilkovisky algebras) of any $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ BRST cohomology and the chiral ring of a topologically twisted $N{=}2$ superconformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantization of the canonical unshifted Poisson structure on the derived cotangent stack $T^\ast[X/G]$ of a quotient stack, where $X$ is a smooth affine scheme with an action of a (reductive) smooth affine group scheme $G$. This is achieved through an {\'e}tale resolution of $T^\ast[X/G]$ by stacky CDGAs that allows for an explicit description of the canonical Poisson structure on $T^\ast[X/G]$ and of the dg-category of modules quantizing it. These techniques are applied to construct a dg-category-valued prefactorization algebra that quantizes a gauge theory on directed graphs.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the universal first-order Massey product of a prefactorization algebra, which encodes higher algebraic operations on the cohomology. Explicit computations of these structures are carried out in the locally constant case, with applications to factorization envelopes on $\mathbb{R}^m$ and a compactification of linear Chern-Simons theory on $\mathbb{R}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian, or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the Riemann surface gives a full control over computation of the Abel image of any point on a curve. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions on given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.09349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twist defects in surface codes can be used to encode more logical qubits, improve the code rate, and implement logical gates. In this work we provide a rigorous formalism for constructing surface codes with twists generalizing the well-defined homological formalism introduced by Kitaev for describing CSS surface codes. In particular, we associate a surface code to any graph $G$ embedded on any 2D-manifold, in such a way that (1) qubits are associated to the vertices of the graph, (2) stabilizers are associated to faces, (3) twist defects are associated to odd-degree vertices. In this way, we are able to reproduce the variety of surface codes, with and without twists, in the literature and produce some new examples. We also calculate and bound various code properties such as the rate and distance in terms of topological graph properties such as genus, systole, and face-width.</description>

Abstract: A Floquet quantum system is governed by a Hamiltonian that is periodic in time. Consider the space of piecewise time-independent Floquet systems with (geometrically) local interactions. We prove that for all but a measure zero set of systems in this space, starting from a random product state, many properties (including expectation values of observables and the entanglement entropy of a macroscopically large subsystem) at long times are approximately periodic with the same period as the Hamiltonian. Thus, in almost every Floquet system of arbitrarily large but finite size, discrete time-crystalline behavior does not persist to strictly infinite time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of singular numbers of products of certain classes of $p$-adic random matrices, as both the matrix size and number of products go to $\infty$ simultaneously. In this limit, we prove convergence of the local statistics to a new random point configuration on $\mathbb{Z}$, defined explicitly in terms of certain intricate mixed $q$-series/exponential sums. This object may be viewed as a nontrivial $p$-adic analogue of the interpolating distributions of Akemann-Burda-Kieburg arXiv:1809.05905, which generalize the sine and Airy kernels and govern limits of complex matrix products. Our proof uses new Macdonald process computations and holds for matrices with iid additive Haar entries, corners of Haar matrices from $\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, and the $p$-adic analogue of Dyson Brownian motion studied in arXiv:2112.03725.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article provides a novel and simple range description for the spherical mean transform of functions supported in the unit ball of an odd dimensional Euclidean space. The new description comprises a set of symmetry relations between the values of certain differential operators acting on the coefficients of the spherical harmonics expansion of the function in the range of the transform. As a central part of the proof of our main result, we derive a remarkable cross product identity for the spherical Bessel functions of the first and second kind, which may be of independent interest in the theory of special functions. Finally, as one application of the range characterization, we construct an explicit counterexample proving that unique continuation type results cannot hold for the spherical mean transform in odd dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for fourth order Schr\"odinger operators with zero resonances on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H = \Delta^2 + V$ be the fourth-order Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a real-valued fast-decaying potential $V$. If zero is neither a resonance nor an eigenvalue of $H$, it was recently known that the wave operators $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and unbounded at the endpoints $p=1$ and $p=\infty$.
  This paper is to further establish the $L^p$-bounds of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ that exhibit all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold. We first prove that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ in the first kind resonance case, and then proceed to establish for the second kind resonance case that they are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; 3$, but not for any $3 \le p \le \infty$.
  In the third kind resonance case, we still show that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;3$ and generally unbounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for any $3\le p\le\infty$. However, it can be also shown that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ remain bounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for all $3\le p&lt;\infty$ if in addition $H$ has a zero eigenvalue, but no $p$-wave zero resonance and all zero eigenfunctions are orthogonal to $x_ix_jx_kV$ in $L^2(\R^3)$ for all $i,j,k=1,2,3$ with $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$.
  These results precisely describle all $L^p$-bounds of the wave operators $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with some exceptions of the endpoint cases for $p=1$ and $p=\infty$. As a result, $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates are derived for the fourth-order Schr\"odinger equations and Beam equations with zero resonance singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a general upper bound to mutual information in terms of the Fisher information. The bound may be further used to derive a lower bound for the Bayesian quadratic cost. These two provide alternatives to other inequalities in the literature (e.g.~the van Trees inequality) that are useful also for cases where the latter ones give trivial bounds. We then generalize them to the quantum case, where they bound the Holevo information in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We illustrate the usefulness of our bounds with a case study in quantum phase estimation. Here, they allow us to adapt to mutual information (useful for global strategies where the prior plays an important role) the known and highly nontrivial bounds for the Fisher information in the presence of noise. The results are also useful in the context of quantum communication, both for continuous and discrete alphabets.</description>

      <title>Casimir energy on the sphere and 6D CFT trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the dependence of the Casimir energy on the trace anomaly coefficients for a six-dimensional CFT on $R\times S^5$. This extends the universal dependence on the central charge in 2D and the relation by Cappelli and Coste in 4D, unveiling the role of the trivial total derivatives in the anomaly that renders the Casimir energy scheme dependent. We obtain
  $$E_o=-\frac{15}{8}\,a_6 -\frac{5}{12}\,\left(g_5+\frac{1}{4}\,g_7+\frac{1}{2}\,g_8-10\, g_9+g_{10}\right),$$ with $a_6$ being the type A central charge and the $g$'s, the coefficients of five out of six terms that form a basis for trivial total derivatives. The derivation is based on the Polyakov formulas (conformal primitive) resulting from the integration of the trace anomaly.
  Alternatively, on a 6D conformally flat background the above basis is redundant and one can simplify further to get, in terms of the Schouten scalar $J$ and the Schouten tensor $V$, Branson's basis for trivial total derivatives $\nabla^2\nabla^2 J$, $\nabla^2J^2$ and $\nabla^2|V|^2+2\nabla\cdot(V\cdot\nabla\,J)$ with coefficients $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$, respectively, \begin{equation} \nonumber
  E_o=-\frac{15}{8}a_6-\frac{1}{24}\left(\gamma_1-\gamma_2 -\frac{1}{8}\gamma_3\right)~. \end{equation}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our study applies the Two-State Formalism alongside weak measurements within a spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological framework, wherein Dirac spinors are intricately coupled to classical gravity. To elucidate this, we provide detailed formulations for computing the weak values of the energy-momentum tensors, the Z component of spin, and the characterization of pure states. Weak measurements appear to be a generalization and extension of the computation already made by Finster an Hainzl, in A spatially homogeneous and isotropic Einstein-Dirac cosmology. Our analysis reveals that the acceleration of the Universe expansion can be understood as an outcome of postselection, underscoring the effectiveness of weak measurement as a discerning approach for gauging cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary. We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.</description>

Abstract: In this article we provide a method for establishing operator-type error estimates between solutions to rapidly oscillating evolutionary equations and their homogenised counter parts. This method is exemplified by applications to the wave, heat and finally thermoelastic evolutionary systems.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cumulants of $q$-step closed and non-closed walks on the Erd\H os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants represent terms of cumulant expansion of the free energy of discrete analogs of matrix models widely known in theoretical and mathematical physics. Using a diagram technique, we show that the leading term $F_k^{(q)}$ of the normalized cumulant of $k$-th order can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for closed walks, respectively. Adapting the Pr\"ufer codification procedure to such diagrams, we get explicit expressions for the number of tree-type diagrams of $k$ elements and show that in certain cases, $F_k^{(q)}$ can be bounded from above by the $k$-th moment of the sum of $k(q-1)+1$ independent Bernoulli random variables. These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the numbers of $q$-step walks in random graphs and to show that in the additional limiting transition of infinite $q$, the term $F_k^{(q)}$, considered for large values of $k$, admits an upper bound that asymptotically coincides with that of the $k$-th moment of the Compound Poisson distribution.</description>
