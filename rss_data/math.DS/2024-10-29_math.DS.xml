      <title>Darboux theory of integrability for real polynomial vector fields on the $n-$dimensional ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend to the $n$-dimensional ellipsoid contained in $\R^{n+1},$ the Darboux theory of integrability for polynomial vector fields in the $n$-dimensional sphere (Llibre et al., 2018). New results on the maximum number of invariant parallels and meridians of polynomial vector fields $\X$ on the invariant $n-$dimensional ellipsoid, as a function of its degree, are provided. Our results extend the known result on the upper bound for the number of invariant hyperplanes that a polynomial vector field $\Y$ in $\R^n$ can have in function of the degree of $\Y$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for any flow $\Psi$ obtained by a Dehn-Fried surgery on an expansive (or equivalently topological pseudo-Anosov) flow $\Phi$ in dimension 3, $\Psi$ is expansive if and only if its stable and unstable foliations do not contain $1$-prong singularities.</description>

      <title>Analysis of dynamics near heteroclinic networks in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with a projected map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heteroclinic cycles and networks are structures in dynamical systems composed of invariant sets and connecting heteroclinic orbits, and can be robust in systems with invariant subspaces. The usual method for analysing the stability of heteroclinic cycles and networks is to construct return maps to cross-sections near the network. From these return maps, transition matrices can be defined, whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be analysed to determine stability. In this paper, we introduce an extension to this methodology, the projected map, which we define by identifying trajectories with, in a certain sense, qualitatively the same dynamics. The projected map is a discrete, piecewise-smooth map of one dimension one fewer than the rank of the transition matrix. We use these maps to describe the dynamics of trajectories near three heteroclinic networks in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with four equilibria. We find in all three cases that the onset of trajectories that switch between cycles of the network can be caused by a fold bifurcation or border-collision bifurcation, where fixed points of the map no longer exist in the corresponding function's domain of definition. We are able to show that trajectories near these three networks are asymptotic to only one subcycle, and cannot switch between subcycles multiple times, in contrast to examples with more than four equilibria, and resolving a 30-year-old claim by Brannath. We are also able to generalise some results to all quasi-simple networks, showing that a border-collision bifurcation of the projected map, corresponding to a condition on the eigenvectors of certain transition matrices, causes a cycle to lose stability.</description>

      <title>Partially hyperbolic geodesic flow via conformal deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new construction of non-Anosov Partially Hyperbolic Geodesic flows. Our construction is closely related to the construction made by Carneiro and Pujals, the novelty is the use of conformal deformations to produce the examples. Some of the necessary conditions appear more naturally and are easier to check. Besides that, we could enumerate the conditions required to produce partially hyperbolic geodesic flow examples. We show how to produce examples with metrics that are non-positively curved and with a finner analysis we can prove ergodicity for the Liouville measure and uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy. These examples lie on the boundary of Anosov metrics, allowing us to also produce metrics with partially hyperbolic geodesic flows and conjugate points.</description>

      <title>How linear can a non-linear hyperbolic IFS be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of M. Hochman, we construct examples of hyperbolic IFSs $\Phi$ on $[0,1]$ where linear and non-linear behaviour coexist. Namely, for every $2\leq r \leq \infty$ we exhibit the existence of a $C^r$-smooth IFS such that $f'\equiv c(\Phi)$ on the attractor and $f''\equiv 0$ for every $f \in \Phi$, yet $\Phi$ is not $C^t$-smooth for any $t&gt;r$, nor $C^r$-conjugate to self-similar. We provide a complete classification of these systems. Furthermore, when $r&gt;1$, we give a necessary and sufficient Livsic-like matching condition for a self-conformal $C^r$-smooth IFS to be conjugated to one of these systems having $f''=0$ on the attractor, for every $f\in \Phi$. We also show that this condition fails to ensure the existence of a $C^1$-conjugacy in mere $C^1$-regularity.</description>

      <title>Directional derivatives and the central limit theorem on compact general one-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will show the central limit theorem for the general one-dimensional lattice where the space of symbols is a compact metric space. We consider the CLT for Lipschitz-Gibbs probabilities and in the proof we use several properties of the Ruelle operator defined on our setting; this will require fixing an {\em a priori probability}. An important issue in the proof of the CLT is the existence of a certain second-order derivative, and this will follow from the analytic properties that will be described in detail throughout the paper. As additional results of independent interest, we will also describe some explicit estimates of the first and second directional derivatives of some dynamical entities like entropy and pressure. For example: given a fixed potential $f$, and a variable observable $\eta$ on the Kernel of the Ruelle operator $\mathcal{L}_f$, we consider the equilibrium probability $\mu_{f + t \,\eta}$ for $f + t \,\eta$. We estimate the values $ \frac{d}{dt} h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})|_{t=0}$ and $ \frac{d^2}{dt^2} h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})|_{t=0}$, where $h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})$ is the entropy of $ \mu_{C + t \,\eta}$. For fixed $f$ we can find conditions that can indicate the $\eta$ attaining the maximal possible value of $ \frac{d}{dt} h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})|_{t=0}$ (up to a natural normalization of $\eta)$, entirely in terms of elements on the kernel of $\mathcal{L}_f$. We also consider directional derivatives of the eigenfunction.</description>

Abstract: We construct a continuous map from the space of orders on quandles to the space of quandle actions on one-manifolds, providing an answer to a question posed by Idrissa Ba and Mohamed Elhamdadi. As an application of this map, we characterize isolated orders on quandles in terms of strong rigidity. As another application, we prove that there is no isolated right order on the free quandles, except for specific cases.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in coiling of falling viscous threads: Revisiting the geometric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "Fluid Mechanic Sewing Machine" creates periodic patterns through the coiling nature of a viscous fluid falling onto a moving surface. At relatively moderate heights, the reported patterns are translating coiling, alternating loops, W pattern, and meander. A simplified theoretical model based on the geometry and local bending of the contact point can predict these patterns. We experimentally explore the patterns in this region by collecting new data to compare with the model. Our review of the model's bifurcation diagram reveals additional patterns beyond the ones reported, although current experiments have not shown their existence. The W pattern, previously omitted in a regime diagram because of its small region, is now shown explicitly. We report on the consistent appearance of a period-doubled version of the W pattern, as well as rare appearances of resonant patterns, both reported for the first time. Comparing the theoretical model to experimental data, we find that the predicted phase diagram and the meander variation deviate from observations. These deviations hint at an unaccounted dynamics that merits further study.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Equidistribution of Small Points for Canonical Heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined over a number field $K$ and let $\varphi: X \to X$ a polarized endomorphism of degree $d \geq 2$. Let $\widehat{h}_{\varphi}$ be the canonical height associated to $\varphi$ on $X(\overline{K})$. Given a generic sequence of points $(x_n)$ with $\widehat{h}_{\varphi}(x_n) \to 0$ and a place $v \in M_K$, Yuan [Yua08] has shown that the conjugates of $x_n$ equidistribute to the canonical measure $\mu_{\varphi,v}$. When $v$ is archimedean, we will prove a quantitative version of Yuan's result. We give two applications of our result to polarized endomorphisms $\varphi$ of smooth projective surfaces that are defined over a number field $K$. The first is an exponential rate of convergence for periodic points of period $n$ to the equilibrium measure and the second is an exponential lower bound on the degree of the extension containing all periodic points of period $n$. When $X$ is an abelian variety, we also give an upper bound on the smallest degree of a hypersurface that contains all points $x \in X(\overline{K})$ satisfying $[K(x):K] \leq D$ and $\widehat{h}_X(x) \leq \frac{c}{D^8}$ for some fixed constant $c &gt; 0$ where $\widehat{h}_X$ is the Neron--Tate height for $X$.</description>

      <title>On the study of the limit cycles for a class of population models with time-varying factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of population models with time-varying factors, represented by one-dimensional piecewise smooth autonomous differential equations.
  We provide several derivative formulas in "discrete" form for the Poincar\'{e} map of such equations, and establish a criterion for the existence of limit cycles.
  These two tools, together with the known ones, are then combined in a preliminary procedure that can provide a simple and unified way to analyze the equations.
  As an application, we prove that a general model of single species with seasonal constant-yield harvesting can only possess at most two limit cycles, which improves the work of Xiao in 2016.
  We also apply our results to a general model described by the Abel equations with periodic step function coefficients, showing that its maximum number of limit cycles, is three.
  Finally, a population suppression model for mosquitos considered by Yu and Li in 2020 and Zheng et al. in 2021 is studied using our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty, characterised by randomness and stochasticity, is ubiquitous in applications of evolutionary game theory across various fields, including biology, economics and social sciences. The uncertainty may arise from various sources such as fluctuating environments, behavioural errors or incomplete information. Incorporating uncertainty into evolutionary models is essential for enhancing their relevance to real-world problems. In this perspective article, we survey the relevant literature on evolutionary dynamics with random payoff matrices, with an emphasis on continuous models. We also pose challenging open problems for future research in this important area.</description>

Abstract: Due to the increasing popularity of futures trading among financial market participants, the risk management of these instruments is crucial. In this paper, we introduce a model for estimating the ideal time for leaving a trading position on a stock. Also, using ergodic theorems, we investigate the European call option pricing problem using a stochastic irrational rotation on the unit circle. Utilizing the properties of log-ergodic processes, we use the time average of the stochastic process of risky assets instead of expectations in our calculations.</description>

      <title>On bifurcation from infinity: a compactification approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar parabolic partial differential equation on the interval with nonlinear boundary conditions that are asymptotically linear. As the parameter crosses critical values (e.g. the Steklov eigenvalues), it is known that there are large equilibria that arise through a bifurcation from infinity (i.e., such equilibria converge, after rescaling, to the Steklov eigenfunctions). We provide a compactification approach to the study of such unbounded bifurcation curves of equilibria, their stability, and heteroclinic orbits. In particular, we construct an induced semiflow at infinity such that the Steklov eigenfunctions are equilibria. Moreover, we prove the existence of infinite-time blow-up solutions that converge, after rescaling, to certain eigenfunctions that are equilibria of the induced semiflow at infinity.</description>

      <title>GRINNs: Godunov-Riemann Informed Neural Networks for Learning Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GRINNs: numerical analysis-informed neural networks for the solution of inverse problems of non-linear systems of conservation laws. GRINNs are based on high-resolution Godunov schemes for the solution of the Riemann problem in hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). In contrast to other existing machine learning methods that learn the numerical fluxes of conservative Finite Volume methods, GRINNs learn the physical flux function per se. Due to their structure, GRINNs provide interpretable, conservative schemes, that learn the solution operator on the basis of approximate Riemann solvers that satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot condition. The performance of GRINNs is assessed via four benchmark problems, namely the Burgers', the Shallow Water, the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards and the Payne-Whitham traffic flow models. The solution profiles of these PDEs exhibit shock waves, rarefactions and/or contact discontinuities at finite times. We demonstrate that GRINNs provide a very high accuracy both in the smooth and discontinuous regions.</description>

      <title>Ivrii's conjecture for some cases in outer and symplectic billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a proof for $(2n + 1,n)$ and $(2n, n-1)$-periodic Ivrii's conjecture for planar outer billiards. We also give new simple geometric proofs for the 3 and 4-periodic cases for outer and symplectic billiards, and generalize for higher dimensions in case of symplectic billiards.</description>

      <title>Extravagance, irrationality and Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotent function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``Renyi measure'' for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotent function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are via the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type theorem for Diophantine approximation with respect to ``weak Renyi measures''.</description>

      <title>Trees and superintegrable Lotka-Volterra families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To any tree on $n$ vertices we associate an $n$-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system with $3n-2$ parameters and, for generic values of the parameters, prove it is superintegrable, i.e. it admits $n-1$ functionally independent integrals. We also show how these systems can be reduced to an ($n-1$)-dimensional system which is superintegrable and solvable by quadratures.</description>

      <title>Neural Context Flows for Meta-Learning of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02154v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) often struggle to adapt to new dynamic behaviors caused by parameter changes in the underlying system, even when these dynamics are similar to previously observed behaviors. This problem becomes more challenging when the changing parameters are unobserved, meaning their value or influence cannot be directly measured when collecting data. To address this issue, we introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a robust and interpretable Meta-Learning framework that includes uncertainty estimation. NCF uses higher-order Taylor expansion to enable contextual self-modulation, allowing context vectors to influence dynamics from other domains while also modulating themselves. After establishing convergence guarantees, we empirically test NCF and compare it to related adaptation methods. Our results show that NCF achieves state-of-the-art Out-of-Distribution performance on 5 out of 6 linear and non-linear benchmark problems. Through extensive experiments, we explore the flexible model architecture of NCF and the encoded representations within the learned context vectors. Our findings highlight the potential implications of NCF for foundational models in the physical sciences, offering a promising approach to improving the adaptability and generalization of NODEs in various scientific applications. Our code is openly available at \url{https://github.com/ddrous/ncflow}.</description>

      <title>Cuntz--Pimsner algebras of partial automorphisms twisted by vector bundles I: Fixed point algebra, simplicity and the tracial state space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate a $C^*$-algebra to a partial action of the integers acting on the base space of a vector bundle, using the framework of Cuntz--Pimsner algebras. We investigate the structure of the fixed point algebra under the canonical gauge action, and show that it arises from a continuous field of $C^*$-algebras over the base space, generalising results of Vasselli. We also analyse the ideal structure, and show that for a free action, ideals correspond to open invariant subspaces of the base space. This shows that if the action is free and minimal, then the Cuntz--Pimsner algebra is simple. Finally we establish a bijective corrrespondence between tracial states and invariant measures on the base space, thereby calculating part of the Elliott invariant. This generalizes results about the $C^*$-algebras associated to homeomorphisms twisted by vector bundles of Adamo, Archey, Forough, Georgescu, Jeong, Strung and Viola.</description>

      <title>On a quadratic Poisson algebra and integrable Lotka-Volterra systems with solutions in terms of Lambert's W function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of integrable nonhomogeneous Lotka-Volterra systems whose quadratic terms are defined by an antisymmetric matrix and whose linear terms consist of three blocks. We provide the Poisson algebra of their Darboux polynomials, and prove a contraction theorem. We then use these results to classify the systems according to the number of functionally independent (and, for some, commuting) integrals. We also establish separability/solvability by quadratures, given the solutions to the 2- and 3-dimensional systems, which we provide in terms of the Lambert W function.</description>

      <title>Modelling advection on distance-weighted directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a model for describing advection dynamics on distance-weighted directed graphs. To this end we establish a set of key properties, or axioms, that a discrete advection operator should satisfy, and prove that there exists an essentially unique operator satisfying all such properties. Both infinite and finite networks are considered, as well as possible variants and extensions. We illustrate the proposed model through examples, both analytical and numerical, and we describe an application to the simulation of a traffic network.</description>
