      <title>DeepInflation: an AI agent for research and model discovery of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \textbf{DeepInflation}, an AI agent designed for research and model discovery in inflationary cosmology. Built upon a multi-agent architecture, \textbf{DeepInflation} integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a symbolic regression (SR) engine and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) knowledge base. This framework enables the agent to automatically explore and verify the vast landscape of inflationary potentials while grounding its outputs in established theoretical literature. We demonstrate that \textbf{DeepInflation} can successfully discover simple and viable single-field slow-roll inflationary potentials consistent with the latest observations (here ACT DR6 results as example) or any given $n_s$ and $r$, and provide accurate theoretical context for obscure inflationary scenarios. \textbf{DeepInflation} serves as a prototype for a new generation of autonomous scientific discovery engines in cosmology, which enables researchers and non-experts alike to explore the inflationary landscape using natural language. This agent is available at https://github.com/pengzy-cosmo/DeepInflation.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical approach to Ly$\alpha$ multiple-scattering in 21-cm signal simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial physical quantity in determining the 21-cm signal during cosmic dawn is the inhomogeneous background of Ly$\alpha$ photons originating from the first galaxies. As these photons travel through the intergalactic medium, their scattering cross-section is often approximated as a delta function at resonance due to computational cost. That is, photons with emitted wavelengths between Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ are assumed to travel in straight lines until they redshift into the Ly$\alpha$ resonance. However, due to the damping wing in the Ly$\alpha$ cross-section, this approximation fails as the frequency of the photon approaches the resonant frequency, resulting in multiple scatterings events that could be separated by non-negligible distances. Some previous works studied this effect of Ly$\alpha$ multiple scattering by running computationally heavy radiative-transfer simulations. However, robustly interpreting the cosmic 21cm signal requires exploring a large parameter space of astrophysical uncertainties, motivating more computationally-efficient approaches. Here we incorporate Ly$\alpha$ multiple scatterings in the public, semi-numerical simulation 21cmFAST. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to study the trajectories of Ly$\alpha$ photons on different scales. We find that the distance distributions of Ly$\alpha$ photons with respect to the absorption point can be modeled as analytical functions that are governed by a single parameter. Upon implementing the distance distributions in 21cmFAST, we find that the multiple scattering effect is important (about 50% difference in the 21-cm power spectrum) only at high redshifts before the spin temperature is fully coupled to the kinetic temperature. Furthermore, we find that Ly$\alpha$ multiple scattering does not enhance Ly$\alpha$ heating, and that the combined effect is negligible, especially under realistic X-ray heating scenarios.</description>

      <title>The era of precision cosmology with voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids, the large underdense regions of our Universe, have emerged over the past decade as powerful cosmological laboratories: their simple dynamics, sensitivity to local gravitational effects and cosmic expansion, and ability to span large volumes, make them uniquely suited to test fundamental physics. Fueled by advances in theory, simulations, and observations, void science has matured into a precision tool for constraining the parameters of the standard cosmological model and its possible extensions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the statistical tools developed to characterize voids, the theoretical models that link them to cosmological parameters, and the methodologies used to extract information from survey data. We highlight the growing synergy between void-based observables and other cosmological probes, and showcase the increasingly stringent constraints derived from voids measured from current survey data and expected from future missions. With the advent of the next generation of galaxy surveys, voids are poised to play a central role in the future of cosmology, turning what was once regarded as emptiness into one of the most promising frontiers of fundamental science.</description>

      <title>Cosmo-FOLD: Fast generation and upscaling of field-level cosmological maps with overlap latent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of probabilistic diffusion models to reduce dramatically the computational cost of expensive hydrodynamical simulations to study the relationship between observable baryonic cosmological probes and dark matter at field level and well into the non-linear regime. We introduce a novel technique, Cosmo-FOLD (Cosmological Fields via Overlap Latent Diffusion) to rapidly generate accurate and arbitrarily large cosmological and astrophysical 3-dimensional fields, conditioned on a given input field. We are able to generate TNG300-2 dark matter density and gas temperature fields from a model trained only on ~1% of the volume (a process we refer to as `upscaling'), reproducing both large scale coherent dark matter filaments and power spectra to within 10% for wavenumbers k &lt;= 5 h Mpc^-1. These results are obtained within a small fraction of the original simulation cost and produced on a single GPU. Beyond one and two points statistics, the bispectrum is also faithfully reproduced through the inclusion of positional encodings. Finally, we demonstrate Cosmo-FOLD's generalisation capabilities by upscaling a CAMELS volume of 25 (Mpc h^-1)^3 to a full TNG300-2 volume of 205 (Mpc h^-1)^3$ with no fine-tuning. Cosmo-FOLD opens the door to full field-level simulation-based inference on cosmological scale.</description>

      <title>An azimuthally resolved study of sloshing cold fronts in three nearby galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of sloshing cold fronts in a sample of three nearby galaxy clusters (Abell 496, Abell 2029, and Abell 1644) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Cold fronts manifest as sharp edges in the X-ray surface brightness of the intracluster medium (ICM) in galaxy clusters. In the residual X-ray surface brightness maps, where the global ICM distribution has been subtracted, cold fronts generated by gas sloshing are observed at the boundaries of the spiral excesses. We perform a systematic and comprehensive study of the surface brightness edges along the spiral excesses. We find the deficit of the thermal pressure radially inward of the brightness edges, in contrast to stripping cold fronts that typically exhibit higher thermal pressure in brightness edges. Assuming that the sharp edges in the X-ray surface brightness distributions are sustained entirely by the gas bulk motions, we estimate the velocity gradients across the edges that are required to compensate for the deficit of the thermal pressure. We do not find statistically significant velocity gradients along the azimuthal direction. Our results suggest that alternative mechanisms such as magnetic fields and viscosity are necessary to maintain the sharpness of sloshing cold fronts.</description>

      <title>Deep Chandra Observations of the z = 1.16 Relaxed, Cool-core Galaxy Cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters serve as a unique and valuable laboratory for probing cosmological models and understanding astrophysics at the high-mass limit of structure formation. Clusters that are dynamically relaxed are especially useful targets of study because of their morphological and dynamical simplicity. However, at redshifts z &gt; 1, very few such clusters have been identified. We present results from new Chandra observations of the cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537 (hereafter SPT J2215), at z = 1.16, the second most distant relaxed, cool-core cluster identified to date. We place constraints on the cluster's total mass profile and investigate its thermodynamic profiles, scaling relations (gas mass, average temperature, and X-ray luminosity), and metal enrichment, resolving the cool core and providing essential context for the massive starburst seen in its central galaxy. We contextualize the thermodynamic and cosmological properties of the cluster within a sample of well-studied, lower-redshift relaxed systems. In this way, SPT J2215 serves as a powerful high-redshift benchmark for understanding the formation of cool cores and the evolution of massive clusters of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: MagLim++ Lens Sample Selection and Measurements of Galaxy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clustering is a sensitive probe of the expansion history and growth of structure of the universe, and key degeneracies can be broken by combining these data with measurements of cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing (a so-called 3$\times$2pt analysis). The largest and least biased statistical samples of galaxies for use in clustering analyses can be collected photometrically through large imaging surveys. However, selecting clean photometric subsamples for cosmology are crucial for avoiding contamination that can bias cosmological constraints. Here we present the MagLim++ galaxy sample, selected to optimize for cosmological constraining power and incorporating an array of novel quality cuts to identify and remove residual contamination. This sample comes from the full six years of observations from the Dark Energy Survey. We present measurements of the two-point angular clustering ($w(\theta)$) of 9,186,205 galaxies distributed over 4031 sq. degrees and in six tomographic redshift bins centered at $\bar{z}\approx$ [0.31, 0.44, 0.62, 0.78, 0.90, 1.01]. These measurements are used as part of the 3$\times$2pt and other DES Y6 legacy cosmological analyses in companion works. We describe the battery of null tests and mitigation schemes implemented to address observational, astrophysical, and methodological systematics in the analysis. The resulting $w(\theta)$ measurements have a S/N = 149 (90.2 for linear scales only), which we use to place galaxy-clustering-only constraints on the matter density of the Universe, $\Omega_m=0.311^{+0.023}_{-0.035}$, and amplitude of galaxy clustering in each redshift bin, $b_i\sigma_8=[1.16^{+0.04}_{-0.06},\ 1.40^{+0.04}_{-0.06},\ 1.57^{+0.04}_{-0.06},\ 1.59^{+0.04}_{-0.05},\ 1.50^{+0.04}_{-0.05},\ 1.74^{+0.06}_{-0.08}]$.</description>

      <title>IRMaGiC: Extending Luminous Red Galaxy Selection into the infrared with joint LSST and Roman HLIS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce IRMaGiC, an algorithm built based on RedMaGiC desgined to enhance the selection of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) across the redshift range $1 \leq z \leq 2$. We show that this method extends the capabilities of the redMaGiC algorithm by applying it to simulated photometric data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's High Latitude Wide Area Survey (HLWAS). By integrating infrared band coverage from Roman HLWAS with LSST's optical bands, IRMaGiC enables red-sequence calibration at higher redshifts. We demonstrate that IRMaGiC reduces scatter and bias in photometric redshift estimates for LRGs at higher redshift, providing more accurate redshift assessments compared to existing methods. Our findings suggest that incorporating infrared data can considerably improve the selection and redshift estimation of LRGs at higher redshift, offering substantial benefits for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Cosmological Constraints from Galaxy Clustering and Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmology results combining galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing measured in the full six years (Y6) of observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) covering $\sim$5000 deg$^2$. We perform a large-scale structure analysis using three two-point correlation functions (3$\times$2pt): (i) cosmic shear from 140 million source galaxy shapes, (ii) galaxy clustering of 9 million lens galaxy positions, and (iii) galaxy-galaxy lensing from their cross-correlation. We model the data in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM cosmologies. The combined analysis yields $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.789^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ and matter density $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.333^{+0.023}_{-0.028}$ in $\Lambda$CDM (68\% CL), where $\sigma_8$ is the clustering amplitude. These constraints show a (full-space) parameter difference of 1.8$\sigma$ from a combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy datasets from Planck 2018, ACT-DR6, and SPT-3G DR1. Projected only into $S_8$ the difference is $2.6\sigma$. In $w$CDM the Y6 3$\times$2pt results yield $S_8 = 0.782^{+0.021}_{-0.020}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.325^{+0.032}_{-0.035}$, and dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w = -1.12^{+0.26}_{-0.20}$. For the first time, we combine all DES dark-energy probes: 3$\times$2pt, SNe Ia, BAO and Clusters. In $\Lambda$CDM this combination yields a $2.8\sigma$ parameter difference from the CMB. When combining DES 3$\times$2pt with other low-redshift datasets (DESI DR2 BAO, DES SNe Ia, SPT clusters), we find a 2.3$\sigma$ parameter difference with CMB. A joint fit of Y6 3$\times$2pt, CMB, and those low-redshift datasets produces the tightest $\Lambda$CDM constraints to date: $S_8 = 0.806^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.302^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$, $h = 0.683^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$, and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.14$ eV (95\% CL). In $w$CDM, this combination yields $w = -0.981^{+0.021}_{-0.022}$.</description>

      <title>A JWST Paschen-alpha Calibration of the Radio Luminosity-Star Formation Rate Relation at z~1.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As radio emission from normal galaxies is a dust-free tracer of star formation, tracing the star formation history of the Universe is a key goal of the SKA and ngVLA. In order to investigate how well radio luminosity traces star formation rate (SFR) in the early Universe, we have examined the radio properties of a JWST Paschen-alpha sample of galaxies at 1.0&lt;=z&lt;=1.8. In the GOODS-S field, we cross-matched a sample of 506 FRESCO Paschen-alpha emitters with the 1.23 GHz radio continuum data from the MeerKAT MIGHTEE survey finding 47 detections. After filtering for AGN (via X-ray detections, hot mid-infrared dust and extended radio emission), as well as blended sources, we obtained a sample of SFGs comprising: 11 cataloged radio detections, 18 non-cataloged detections (at ~3-5sigma) and 298 undetected sources. Stacking the 298 undetected sources we obtain a 3.3sigma detection in the radio. This sample, along with a local sample of Paschen-alpha emitters, lies along previous radio luminosity/SFR relations from local (z&lt;0.2) to high redshift (z~1). Fitting the FRESCO data at 1.0&lt;=z&lt;=1.8 we find log(L_1.4GHz) = (1.31+/-0.17) x log(SFR_Pa-alpha) + (21.36+/-0.17) which is consistent with other literature relations. We can explain some of the observed scatter in the L_1.4GHz/SFR_Pa-alpha correlation by a toy model in which the synchrotron emission is a delayed/averaged tracer of the instantaneous Paschen-alpha SFR by ~10/75 Myr.</description>

      <title>CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: Cosmological constraints from double-source-plane strong lensing systems in era of CSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double source plane strong lensing (DSPL) systems offer a robust, independent probe of cosmological parameters. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) is expected to discover hundreds of DSPLs, yet the survey modes and system configurations that best enable cosmological inference remain uncertain. To investigate the impact of varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and Einstein radius ratios of DSPLs (denoted as $\beta^{-1}$ parameters) on cosmographic inference under different CSST survey modes (Wide Field (WF), Deep Field (DF), and Ultra-Deep Field (UDF)), we simulate and model mock lenses with Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) mass profiles and S\'ersic sources whose image properties are tailored to CSST specifications. Assuming a flat $w$CDM universe with fiducial values $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.30966$ and $w = -1$, and uniform priors of $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0, 1]$ and $w \in [-2, -1/3$), we find that the constraining power on cosmological parameters for a given DSPL system increases significantly with survey depth. For a representative DSPL system with two prominent arcs and a moderate $\beta^{-1}=1.17$, the constraints on ($w, \Omega_{\rm m}$) improve from ($-1.28_{-1.00}^{+0.64}, 0.50_{-0.32}^{+0.28}$) in the WF to ($-1.59_{-0.32}^{+0.63}, 0.42_{-0.06}^{+0.15}$) in the UDF. Furthermore, we find that systems with smaller $\beta$ values yield tighter cosmographic constraints. We conclude that DSPL systems identified in UDF observations, particularly those with small $\beta$, are the most promising candidates for early-stage cosmological studies with CSST.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on f(T,B) Gravity from Observations of Early and Late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework that combines early- and late-Universe observations to constrain three functional realizations of f(T,B) gravity: the linear, quadratic, and general power-law models. First, constraints on deviations from the standard weak interaction freeze-out temperature are derived using the most recent measurements of the primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we perform a joint analysis incorporating five priors: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and Cosmic Microwave Background in order to place bounds on the model parameters. The joint likelihood analysis significantly tightens the constraints compared to individual datasets. Third, we test the null, strong, and dominant energy conditions to evaluate the physical viability of the best-fit solutions across the cosmic redshift range. Our results show that all three f(T,B) models are consistent with current observations and exhibit stable behavior under the energy-condition criteria, supporting torsion-boundary modified gravity as a robust and viable alternative to General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Magnification modeling and its impact on galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing magnification alters the observed spatial distribution of galaxies and must be accounted for to prevent biases in cosmological probes of the large-scale structure. We investigate its effects on the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses using the fiducial lens (position tracer) sample MagLim++. Magnification bias is parameterized by a coefficient that describes the response of the number of selected objects per unlensed area element to a change in the lensing convergence. We quantify this coefficient using the Balrog synthetic source injection catalog to account for the complexity of the selection function, and compare these results with simplified estimates. The resulting values of the magnification coefficients for each redshift bin are [3.16 $\pm$ 0.08, 2.76 $\pm$ 0.21, 4.09 $\pm$ 0.15, 4.42 $\pm$ 0.16, 4.90 $\pm$ 0.29, 4.83 $\pm$ 0.25]. Relative to Year 3, this analysis provides more precise and accurate magnification bias estimates through a larger Balrog area and reweighting to better match the data properties. The cosmological results are robust when tested against various magnification parameter prior choices and also when adding cross-clustering between lens redshift bins. Neglecting magnification, however, introduces significant systematic shifts: relative to the fiducial analysis with Gaussian priors centered on the Balrog-derived estimates, we observe shifts of 1.37$\sigma$ in $S_8$ and -0.84$\sigma$ in $\Omega_m$ (with cosmic shear included: -0.61$\sigma$ in $S_8$ and -0.71$\sigma$ in $\Omega_m$), in agreement with findings from simulated data, demonstrating that magnification must be modeled to avoid biases. Freeing the magnification bias in lens bin 2 leads to unphysical negative values, further justifying its exclusion from the fiducial Year 6 analysis.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Weak Lensing and Galaxy Clustering Cosmological Analysis Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the methodology for the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 6 data set. In this work, we design and validate the analysis pipeline for the cosmic shear, galaxy clustering plus galaxy$-$galaxy lensing ($2 \times 2$pt), and the joint analysis in the $3 \times 2$pt. Our framework accounts for key theoretical uncertainties, such as baryonic feedback and galaxy bias, incorporating both linear and non-linear models. We apply scale cuts in regimes where theoretical modeling becomes unreliable. The robustness of the pipeline is validated using mock data and simulations, confirming unbiased cosmological constraints and highlighting the importance of posterior projection effects in the validation process. As a result, we deliver robust and validated analysis pipelines for cosmic shear, $2 \times 2$pt, and $3 \times 2$pt in $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM scenarios, including a well-defined set of scales suitable for real data analysis, a robust prescription for theoretical systematics, and the theoretical covariance of the signal. This comprehensive methodology also lays the groundwork for future galaxy surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>The First Upper Bound on the Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Cross-Correlation signal using 15-year NANOGrav Data and DESI Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of a common-spectrum stochastic signal by multiple pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has provided tentative evidence for a nanohertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). This signal can be widely interpreted as originating from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Current PTA analyses primarily constrain the SGWB power spectrum and its auto-angular power spectrum. However, the supermassive black holes will produce an underlying correlation with the large-scale structure of the Universe, which can help in understanding the formation and evolution of the binaries. In this work, we develop a new analysis pipeline PyGxGW-PTA for studying the cross-correlation of nHz GW signal with galaxy surveys ($C^{\rm g\, GW}_\ell$) and obtain the first constraint on the SGWB and galaxy distribution cross-correlation using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset in combination with the DESI galaxy catalog. We find no statistically significant correlation between the SGWB and the large-scale distribution of DESI galaxies and using an optimal estimator we put an upper bound on $C^{\rm g\, GW}_{\ell=8} &lt; 0.0083$ at $95\%$ C.I. This yields the first observational upper limit on the spatial correlation between the nHz SGWB and the large-scale structure of the Universe, establishing the observational groundwork for future multi-tracer analyses that will combine PTA data with next-generation galaxy surveys to unveil the SMBHB-galaxy correlation.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey: DESI-Independent Angular BAO Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the angular Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale from the completed Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset excluding the area of overlap with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We follow the same methodology and validation process as in the DES Y6 BAO analysis. We interpret the impact of this measurement in the context of the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM over $\Lambda$CDM when combined with DES Y5 Type Ia supernovae (SN), Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and DESI BAO. Based on our previous work, using the full Y6 DES BAO sample, in combination with SN, CMB and DESI DR1 BAO, added 0.3$\sigma$ in this preference (from 3.7$\sigma$ to 4.0$\sigma$), but this ignored possible correlations between datasets. Using our new DESI-independent DES BAO likelihood instead, we find a smaller increase in the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM, from 3.7$\sigma$ to 3.8$\sigma$ when using DESI DR1 BAO, and from 4.0$\sigma$ to 4.1$\sigma$ when updating to the more recent DESI DR2 BAO. These significances reduce to 3.1$\sigma$ when using the new calibrated DES SN-Dovekie. Alongside this work, we publicly release BAOfit_wtheta, the BAO fitting code for the angular correlation function used in the DES Y6 BAO analysis.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Galaxy-galaxy lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present galaxy--galaxy lensing (GGL) measurements from the full six years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6), covering $4031\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ and used in the DES Y6 $3\times2$pt cosmological analysis. We use the MagLim++ lens sample, containing $\sim 9$ million galaxies divided into six redshift bins, and the Metadetection source catalog, including $\sim 140$ million galaxies divided into four redshift bins. The mean tangential shear signal achieves a total signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of $173$, corresponding to a $17\%$ improvement over DES Y3. After applying the scale cuts used in the cosmological analysis, with $R_{\min}=6\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$ ($4\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) for the linear (nonlinear) galaxy-bias model, the S/N is reduced to $75$ (90). A comprehensive suite of validation tests demonstrates that the measurement is robust against observational and astrophysical systematics at the statistical precision required for the DES Y6 analysis. Although not used in the main cosmological analysis, we extract high--signal-to-noise geometric shear-ratio measurements from the galaxy--galaxy lensing signal on small angular scales. These measurements provide an internal consistency check on the photometric redshift distributions and shear calibration used in the $3\times2$pt analysis.</description>

      <title>Cosmic strings, domain walls and environment-dependent clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data favour phantom-crossing dark energy, motivating models with non-minimal couplings that induce a fifth force on structure formation. Reconciling these models with local tests often requires strong screening, leading to environment-dependent clustering. We investigate such effects via a late-time structure-induced phase transition driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar field. For this purpose, we introduce norns, a fully relativistic cosmological particle-mesh code that self-consistently evolves a complex scalar field - a generalisation of the symmetron producing global U(1) strings rather than domain walls. Using simulations, we compare string and wall-forming models, quantifying impacts on the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and defect dynamics. Strong environment-dependent effects can generate significant departures from LCDM in underdense regions while keeping the overall power spectrum changes modest (~ 4-15% at k~0.3-0.5 h Mpc^-1, sub-percent for z &gt; 0.2). We find that an attractive fifth force can locally suppress structure growth in voids while enhancing it in surrounding overdense regions by driving outflows from the voids. These effects leave distinctive signatures in the matter density probability density function and in marked halo power spectra, which are likely detectable in low-redshift data.</description>

      <title>A spectroscopically confirmed, strongly lensed, metal-poor Type II supernova at z = 5.13</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04156v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observing supernovae (SNe) in the early Universe (z &gt; 3) provides a window into how both galaxies and individual stars have evolved over cosmic time, yet a detailed study of high-redshift stars and SNe has remained difficult due to their extreme distances and cosmological redshifting. To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of "SN Eos": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-{\alpha} emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300{\AA}) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (&lt;= 0.1 Z_{\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.</description>

      <title>The Little Red Dots Are Direct Collapse Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery by JWST of a substantial population of compact "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) presents a major puzzle: their observed spectra defy standard astrophysical interpretations. Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution -- linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived ($&gt;100$ Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure. Our findings indicate that JWST is witnessing the widespread formation of heavy black hole seeds in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Emergent Large Lepton Mixing from Neutrino Refraction in Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel origin for the disparity between quark and lepton flavor mixing based on the refractive nature of neutrino masses. We postulate that the fundamental mixing in both the quark and lepton sectors is CKM-like, together with tiny vacuum neutrino masses, while the observed PMNS mixing matrix emerges dynamically from coherent forward scattering of neutrinos on an ultralight dark matter background. The resulting in-medium Hamiltonian rotates CKM mixing angles into large effective lepton mixings, naturally realizing quark--lepton complementarity without invoking new flavor symmetries. This framework links neutrino mass generation, flavor mixing, and dark matter, and predicts environment-dependent neutrino oscillation effects testable in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Growth of Light Seed Black Holes in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses exceeding $10^6 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at redshifts $z &gt; 8$, posing significant challenges to existing models of early black hole formation and growth. Here we show, in a fully cosmological setting, that light seed black holes (LSBHs), remnants of Population III stars, can grow rapidly to $\sim10^4 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in the early Universe. This growth is enabled by our novel black hole seeding prescription and the unprecedented resolution of our zoom-in cosmological simulations, which resolve the dense environments necessary for efficient accretion. Our results provide robust evidence that LSBHs can attain the masses required to serve as the dominant progenitors of the SMBH population observed at later cosmic epochs. These findings have far-reaching implications for the interpretation of JWST observations and future gravitational wave detections with LISA.</description>

      <title>The Carousel Lens I: A Spectroscopic Survey of the Carousel Lens Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic survey of field galaxies and lensed sources in the vicinity of the strong lensing galaxy cluster known as the Carousel lens at z=0.49. Using both Gemini/GMOS slitmask spectra and deep VLT/MUSE observations, we bring the total number of lensed sources up to 13, including three which were not previously known from imaging observations but are apparent in the MUSE data as emission-line sources. Of these sources, 10 have confident redshifts, and an additional 2 have tentative redshifts from likely Ly$\alpha$ emission (including seven new redshifts determined here adding to those presented previously in Sheu et al. (2024)). The lensed sources span a redshift range from z=0.96 to 4.09 with most of them showing 3-5 images, including four sources displaying central or radial images. In total, we identify 43 images of these 13 sources. This lens system is remarkably symmetric and well-modeled by a simpler lens model than typical cluster lenses, and the large number of sources and their large range of redshifts make this cluster ideal for constraining cosmological parameters such as $w$ and $\Omega_m$ as well as the cluster density profile. Additionally, we present a catalog of 57 unlensed field galaxies with confident redshifts, of which 49 are associated with the cluster. We measure a cluster velocity dispersion of about 1100 km s$^{-1}$ from which we estimate a halo mass $M_{200c} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{15} M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>The role of angular momentum in general relativity: heuristic and covariant interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the role of angular momentum in general relativity from both heuristic and fully covariant perspectives, with the aim of clarifying conceptual ambiguities that arise when Newtonian intuition is extrapolated into the relativistic regime. Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case.</description>

      <title>Combined constraints on dark photons from high-energy collisions, cosmology, and astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a dark sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) through a kinetically mixed dark photon $U$ associated with a new $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing $\varepsilon$ induces an effective coupling to the electromagnetic current, while $U$ interacts with stable dark matter (DM) $\chi$ via a dark gauge coupling $g_\chi$. Our analysis is based on the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, extended to include dark photon production and decay into dileptons ($U\!\to e^+e^-$). In PHSD, dark photons are produced in high-energy collisions through Dalitz decays of light mesons ($\pi^0,\eta,\eta',\omega$), Delta-resonances ($\Delta\!\to N U$), direct vector meson decays ($\rho,\omega,\phi\!\to U$), kaon decays, and $q\bar q\!\to U$ annihilation. Building on previous PHSD benchmarks against dilepton data, we extract upper limits on $\varepsilon^2(m_U,m_\chi,\alpha_\chi)$ in both the visible regime ($m_U&lt;2m_\chi$), where $U\!\to e^+e^-$ dominates, and the invisible regime ($m_U&gt;2m_\chi$), where $U\!\to\chi\bar\chi$ is kinematically open. Cosmological and astrophysical constraints are incorporated in two complementary ways. First, we compute the velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section $\sigma/m_\chi$ for Yukawa-mediated SIDM and confront it with bounds from dwarf galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters. Second, we determine thermal relic target curves by computing the relic abundance and requiring $\Omega_{\rm DM}h^2\simeq 0.12$, consistent with \textit{Planck} measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Combining PHSD limits on $\varepsilon^2$ with relic density and self-interaction requirements, we exclude regions of the $(m_\chi,m_U)$ plane for each DM realization (Dirac, Majorana, or complex scalar) and identify benchmark scenarios in which heavy-ion, cosmological, and astrophysical constraints are simultaneously satisfied.</description>

      <title>Efficient prior sensitivity analysis for Bayesian model comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian model comparison implements Occam's razor through its sensitivity to the prior. However, prior-dependence makes it important to assess the influence of plausible alternative priors. Such prior sensitivity analyses for the Bayesian evidence are expensive, either requiring repeated, costly model re-fits or specialised sampling schemes. By exploiting the learned harmonic mean estimator (LHME) for evidence calculation we decouple sampling and evidence calculation, allowing resampled posterior draws to be used directly to calculate the evidence without further likelihood evaluations. This provides an alternative approach to prior sensitivity analysis for Bayesian model comparison that dramatically alleviates the computational cost and is agnostic to the method used to generate posterior samples. We validate our method on toy problems and a cosmological case study, reproducing estimates obtained by full Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and nested sampling re-fits. For the cosmological example considered our approach achieves up to $6000\times$ lower computational cost.</description>

Abstract: According to modern physics, our Universe is baryon-asymmetric. That phenomenon can not be described in the frameworks of the Standard Model of particle physics. Globally, the Universe consists of baryon matter. However, some scenarios can lead to the existence of local antimatter domains. In the research, the chemical evolution of such an isolated antimatter domain, surrounded by baryonic matter, is studied. The size of the domain is estimated according to the conditions of its survival in baryon surrounding, and the process of annihilation at its border is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Exact general solutions for cosmological scalar field evolution in a vacuum-energy dominated expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $\phi$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B &gt; -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln \phi$, $V = V_0 \phi^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/\phi$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B &gt; -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B &gt; -1$.</description>

      <title>Exploring selection biases in FRB dispersion-galaxy cross-correlations with magnetohydrodynamical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in conjunction with their redshifts can be used as powerful probes of the distribution of extragalactic plasma. With a large enough sample, the free-electron--galaxy power spectrum $P_{eg}$ can be measured by cross-correlating FRB DMs with galaxy positions. However, a precise measurement of $P_{eg}$ requires a careful investigation of selection effects: the probability of both observing the FRB DM and obtaining a host galaxy redshift depends on their properties. We ray trace through the magnetohydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG to investigate the impact of expected observational selection effects on FRB dispersion--galaxy angular cross-correlations with a sample of 3000 FRBs at $0.3\leq z\leq 0.4$ . Our results show that cross-correlations with such an FRB sample are robust to properties of the FRB host galaxy: this includes DM contributions from the FRB host and optical follow-up selection effects. We also find that such cross-correlations are robust to DM-dependent and scattering selection effects specific to the CHIME/FRB survey. However, a DM-dependent selection effect that cuts off the 10\% most dispersed FRBs at a fixed redshift shell can bias the amplitude of the cross-correlation signal by over 50\% at angular scales of $\sim 0.1^\circ$, corresponding to $\sim$ Mpc physical scales. Our findings highlight the importance of both measuring and accounting for selection effects present in existing FRB surveys, as well as mitigating DM-dependent selection effects in the design of upcoming FRB surveys aiming to probe large-scale structure with FRBs.</description>

      <title>CHEX-MATE: New detections and properties of the radio diffuse emission in massive clusters with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern radio telescopes are revolutionising our understanding of non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters, collecting large samples of extended sources with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. In this work, we present novel MeerKAT observations for a sample of 21 galaxy clusters that are part of the CHEX-MATE project. These systems were selected based on their high mass and displaying signs of dynamical activity. Thanks to the high-quality data at hand, we were able to detect extended radio emission in every target considered. We report two new halos, one new relic, and two new candidate relics. We also confirm a previous candidate halo and two candidate relics. After investigating the scaling relations with the cluster properties, we confirmed the presence of a radio halo power-mass correlation and relate it to a higher radio halo emissivity in more massive clusters. For radio relics, we highlight the MeerKAT capabilities to significantly extend the depth of radio observations to a new, unexplored field of low-radio power sources ($\lesssim 10^{23} ~ {\rm W~Hz^{-1}} $ at 1.28 GHz). Thanks to such high-sensitivity data, we have found that the radio relic power can be characterised by a wide range of values for a given cluster mass and relic size. Ultimately, we discuss how current radio observations, in combination with large radio surveys, are increasingly capable of testing numerical simulation predictions and coming close to performing direct comparisons with their data, enabling new insights on the evolution of radio relics.</description>

      <title>Generation of Lognormal Synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest Spectra for $P_{1D}$ Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional flux power spectrum (P1D) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest probes small-scale structure in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is therefore sensitive to a variety of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. These include the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal history of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale fluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly sensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate synthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these effects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for generating one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D analysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted flux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation parameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \leq z \leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \leq k \leq 1.0$ s km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to sub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we discuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of astrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects. Such improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and enable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D inference and precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the extragalactic background light at 8600\r{A} using dark cloud shadow and the CaII-triplet lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of a measurement of the near infrared Extragalactic Background Light using the dark-cloud method. Long-slit spectra covering the opaque core of the intermediate--latitude globule DC303.8-14.2 and the almost unobscured off area were measured using nodding-along-the-slit measuring technique providing a differential spectrum free of most of the foreground components. A template for the only remaining major foreground component, the scattered integrated starlight dominated by the strong Ca II triplet lines at 8498, 8542, 8664$\r{A}$, from the dark core itself was constructed using the GAIA RVS spectral database. The derived EBL intensity is $1.62\pm 0.76(\sigma_{stat})\, 10^{-9} erg\, cm^{-2} s^{-1}\r{A}^{-1} sr^{-1}$ or $13.8\pm6.5(\sigma_{stat})$nW m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$; this represents a tentative detection at $2.1\sigma$, level.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Collider Gravitational Waves sourced by Right-handed Neutrino production from Bubbles: Testing Seesaw, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a minimal type-I seesaw framework in which a first-order phase transition (FOPT), driven by a singlet scalar, produces right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) through bubble collisions, realizing a cosmic-scale collider that probes ultra-high energy scales. The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_{\chi} \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $\Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 5\Omega_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.</description>

      <title>Cluster number counts in dark energy model with energy and momentum coupling to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influences on the cluster number counts from the coupling between dark energy and dark matter with momentum transfer are investigated. We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $\Lambda$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Consequently, there is no statistically significant evidence of an improved fit over the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework based on the eROSITA cluster number counts.</description>

      <title>Scalar and vector dark matter admixed neutron stars with linear and quadratic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark scalar- and vector-mediated interactions on dark matter admixed neutron stars, employing the two-fluid formalism. We adopt three different nuclear equations of state -- BSk22, MPA1 and APR4 -- to describe the baryonic sector, while the dark component consists of fermionic particles within a relativistic mean field framework. We consider both linear and quadratic scalar interactions with the dark fermion, including a quartic self-interaction in the latter case. The parameters of the dark matter models are inferred via a Bayesian analysis that incorporates data from NICER observations and binary neutron star merger detections. The neutron star configurations obtained from the selected model parameters develop dark matter cores, leading to more compact objects with smaller masses and radii. Our findings suggest that scalar interactions generally have a weaker impact on the stellar structure compared to vector-mediated ones, though quantitative differences arise. In particular, quadratic scalar couplings suppress the net attractive interaction, allowing for larger dark matter fractions to be accreted. We also compute the sound speed of DM, finding that the scalar and quadratic interactions modify the stiffness of the dark equation of state while respecting causality: vector repulsion enhances the sound speed, whereas scalar attraction tends to soften it. We compare our results with GW1708017, GW190425 and NICER data and constrain DM couplings and mass.</description>

      <title>Coupled Time-Dependent Proton Acceleration and Leptonic-Hadronic Radiation in Turbulent Supermassive Black Hole Coronae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling, and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration--modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation--with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that cascade feedback on proton cooling can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible tool efficiently models multi-messenger signals from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to gauge fields via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta during inflation. The amplified gauge fields act as a source for both scalar and tensor perturbations. In this work, we propose a mechanism for suppressing scalar perturbations while sourcing strong tensor perturbations. We present an implementation of such a mechanism, demonstrating that sourced tensor perturbations are expected to be detected by upcoming next-generation CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of long-rising type II Supernovae -- Bayesian Analytic Modeling and Spectrophotometric Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40 days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only $\sim$1-3\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07 M$_\odot$), similar to SN 1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5 foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modeling of the growing number of peculiar transients.</description>

      <title>Radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of Population III star formation during the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations find that pockets of star-forming gas could remain pristine up until the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) due to the inhomogeneous nature of metal mixing and enrichment in the early Universe. Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\,\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\star} \approx 70\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments.</description>
