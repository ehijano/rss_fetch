      <title>Multi-omics network reconstruction with collaborative graphical lasso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: In recent years, the availability of multi-omics data has increased substantially. Multi-omics data integration methods mainly aim to leverage different molecular layers to gain a complete molecular description of biological processes. An attractive integration approach is the reconstruction of multi-omics networks. However, the development of effective multi-omics network reconstruction strategies lags behind.
  Results: In this study, we introduce collaborative graphical lasso, a novel approach that extends graphical lasso by incorporating collaboration between omics layers, thereby improving multi-omics data integration and enhancing network inference. Our method leverages a collaborative penalty term, which harmonizes the contribution of the omics layers to the reconstruction of the network structure. This promotes a cohesive integration of information across modalities, and it is introduced alongside a dual regularization scheme that separately controls sparsity within and between layers. To address the challenge of model selection in this framework, we propose XStARS, a stability-based criterion for multi-dimensional hyperparameter tuning. We assess the performance of collaborative graphical lasso and the corresponding model selection procedure through simulations, and we apply them to publicly available multi-omics data. This application demonstrated collaborative graphical lasso recovers established biological interactions while suggesting novel, biologically coherent connections.
  Availability and implementation: We implemented collaborative graphical lasso as an R package, available on CRAN as coglasso. The results of the manuscript can be reproduced running the code available at https://github.com/DrQuestion/coglasso_reproducible_code</description>

      <title>TwinPurify: Purifying gene expression data to reveal tumor-intrinsic transcriptional programs via self-supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies have transformed tumor ecosystem profiling at cellular resolution. However, large scale studies on patient cohorts continue to rely on bulk transcriptomic data, where variation in tumor purity obscures tumor-intrinsic transcriptional signals and constrains downstream discovery. Many deconvolution methods report strong performance on synthetic bulk mixtures but fail to generalize to real patient cohorts because of unmodeled biological and technical variation.
  Here, we introduce TwinPurify, a representation learning framework that adapts the Barlow Twins self-supervised objective, representing a fundamental departure from the deconvolution paradigm. Rather than resolving the bulk mixture into discrete cell-type fractions, TwinPurify instead learns continuous, high-dimensional tumor embeddings by leveraging adjacent-normal profiles within the same cohort as "background" guidance, enabling the disentanglement of tumor-specific signals without relying on any external reference.
  Benchmarked against multiple large cancer cohorts across RNA-seq and microarray platforms, TwinPurify outperforms conventional representation learning baselines like auto-encoders in recovering tumor-intrinsic and immune signals. The purified embeddings improve molecular subtype and grade classification, enhance survival model concordance, and uncover biologically meaningful pathway activities compared to raw bulk profiles. By providing a transferable framework for decontaminating bulk transcriptomics, TwinPurify extends the utility of existing clinical datasets for molecular discovery.</description>
