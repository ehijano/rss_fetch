      <title>New Spallation Background Rejection Techniques to Greatly Improve the Solar Neutrino Sensitivity of JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the potential of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure solar neutrinos is known, realizing this potential requires new techniques to reduce detector backgrounds. One of the most serious backgrounds is due to the beta decays of unstable nuclei produced through muon breakup (spallation) of nuclei. This background is much more significant in JUNO compared to Super-Kamiokande due to JUNO's shallower depth and its lack of directional information. We present the first detailed theoretical calculations of spallation backgrounds in JUNO, showing the underlying physical processes and new ways to cut backgrounds while preserving signals. A key point is showing the importance of neutron tagging to identify hadronic showers, which are rare but produce almost all of the dangerous isotopes. With our new techniques, JUNO will be able to reduce deadtime (signal loss) by a factor of five and to reduce the running time needed to meet sensitivity goals by a factor of two. This will give JUNO greatly improved sensitivity to $^8$B and $hep$ solar neutrinos, as we will explore in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Electron Interactions Alter the Luminosity and Spectral Index of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that cosmic-ray electron cooling through dark matter-electron scatterings contributes to the low radiative efficiency observed in radio-loud galaxies such as M87. Light dark matter can scatter efficiently off electrons in M87, lowering the observed bolometric luminosity compared to astrophysical expectations. This consideration allows us to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark matter-electron interactions. We further model the cosmic-ray electron distribution by numerically solving a diffusion equation along the jet and find that efficient dark matter-electron interactions can induce a flattening of the spectral index at different distances from the central supermassive black hole, in better alignment with radio observations from M87.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization to three loops in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic vacuum polarization at low virtualities limits the precision of experimental tests of the standard model via important physical observables. Here we compute that effect in two-flavor chiral perturbation theory to three loops. Among the master integrals that describe the amplitude, six are elliptic functions of the momentum. Of these five are new to this work, although all can be related to the three-loop sunset integral. The renormalizability of the amplitude hinges on relations between the master integrals that were not previously known and that are not consequences of the integration-by-parts reduction. Our result is intended to serve as a starting point for phenomenological calculations, as well as the computation of finite-volume corrections in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Updated Constraints on Large Extra Dimensions from Reactor Antineutrino Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on large extra dimensions (LED) using the latest results from reactor antineutrino experiments. Specifically, we analyze the full data sets from Daya Bay, RENO, KamLAND, NEOS, and STEREO to derive updated bounds. For the case of one extra dimension, we find constrains on its radius $a$ of $a \lesssim 0.58~{\rm \mu m}$ ($a \lesssim 0.12~{\rm \mu m}$) at the $99\%$ confidence level for normal (inverted) ordering, an improvement of approximately $\sim 20\%$ ($\sim 25\%$) with respect to previous bounds, assuming a massless lightest active neutrino. Furthermore, we present new limits on $4+d$ LED scenarios, with $d = 2, 3, 4$ denoting the number of extra dimensions, based on the same reactor data and assuming equal radii for all extra dimensions. We find that the constraints become increasingly stringent with a larger number of extra dimensions. In particular, $d = 4$ with a massless lightest active neutrino, we obtain limits of $a \lesssim 0.28~{\rm \mu m}$ for normal and $a \lesssim 0.05~{\rm \mu m}$ for inverted orderings at the $99\%$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Searching for the QCD critical point through constant entropy density contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to locate the QCD critical point by constructing an expansion along contours of constant entropy density. Applying two independent analysis of lattice QCD data at zero baryon chemical potential, we find a critical point at $T_c = 114 \pm 7$ MeV and $\mu_{B_c} = 602 \pm 62$ MeV for an expansion truncated at order $\mu_B^2$. This approach is consistent with recent lattice QCD results up to $\mu_B/T \leq 3$. A more precise determination of the required expansion coefficients from lattice simulations will be essential for reliably establishing the location of the QCD critical endpoint.</description>

      <title>A short review on QCD sum rule studies of P-wave single heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, the study of singly heavy baryons has entered a golden era, with numerous excited states observed by experimental collaborations. Various theoretical approaches have been developed to investigate their properties, with the QCD sum rule method being one of the most widely applied. This paper provides a review of these QCD sum rule studies. Over the last ten years, we have systematically studied $P$-wave singly heavy baryons using QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. These $P$-wave singly heavy baryons can explain many excited heavy baryons, including the $\Lambda_c(2595)^+$, $\Lambda_c(2625)^+$, $\Xi_c(2790)^{0/+}$, $\Xi_c(2815)^{0/+}$, $\Sigma_c(2800)^0$, $\Xi_c(2882)^0$, $\Xi_c(2923)^0$, $\Xi_c(2939)^0$, $\Xi_c(2965)^0$, $\Omega_c(3000)^0$, $\Omega_c(3066)^0$, $\Omega_c(3090)^0$, $\Omega_c(3050)^0$, $\Omega_c(3119)^0$, $\Lambda_b(5912)^0$, $\Lambda_b(5920)^0$, $\Xi_b(6087)^0$, $\Xi_b(6095)^0/\Xi_b(6100)^-$, $\Sigma_b(6097)^\pm$, $\Xi_b(6227)^-$, $\Omega_b(6316)^-$, $\Omega_b(6330)^-$, $\Omega_b(6340)^-$, and $\Omega_b(6350)^-$, etc. Furthermore, we predict additional $P$-wave singly heavy baryons, including two $\Lambda_b$ states, two $\Xi_b$ states, three $\Sigma_b$ states, three $\Xi_b^\prime$ states, two $\Omega_b$ states, two $\Lambda_c$ states, two $\Xi_c$ states, three $\Sigma_c$ states, and one $\Omega_c$ state, all with relatively narrow decay widths, making them viable candidates for experimental observation. The study of singly heavy baryons is closely related to two meaningful questions:"What is the shortest possible lifetime of an observable particle?" and "How can one generally describe approximate (flavor) symmetries?".</description>

      <title>Coscattering Dark Matter in Scotogenic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Scotogenic mechanism is an appealing pathway to naturally explain the common origin of dark matter and tiny neutrino mass. However, the conventional scotogenic dark matter usually suffers stringent constraints from the non-observation of lepton flavor violation and direct detection. To generate the non-zero neutrino masses, at least two generations of dark particles are required. For example, two real scalar singlets $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are involved in the scotogenic inverse model, which are odd under the $Z_2$ symmetry. In this paper, we consider the masses of dark scalars are nearly degenerate $m_{\phi_1}\lesssim m_{\phi_2}$, which opens new viable pathway for the generation of dark matter $\phi_1$, such as the coscattering process $\phi_1\text{SM}\to \phi_2 \text{SM}$ and coannihilation processes $\phi_1 \phi_2 \to \text{SM SM}$ via the Higgs portal or Yukawa portal interactions. We explore the parameter space to produce the correct relic density through coscattering, as well as the contrastive coannihilation channel. We then comprehensively study the constraints of dark matter from Higgs decay, direct detection, and indirect detection. For the heavier dark scalar, the three-body decay $\phi_2\to\phi_1 f\bar{f}$ not only alerts the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background, but also leads to the observable displaced vertex signature at colliders.</description>

      <title>Strange Pentaquark Molecules in QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we systematically construct hidden- and open-strange pentaquarks in the hadronic molecular picture to search for possible partners of hadronic molecular state multiplets in the strange quark sector using QCD sum rules. Within this picture, 21 distinct currents are constructed with $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. There is no bound state found from $J^P = 1/2^-$ currents, while three of them from $J^P = 3/2^-$ currents are bound-state solutions consistent with the $\Lambda(2050)3/2^-$, $\Xi(2250)$, and $N(2120)3/2^-$ states, which can be identified as $\Lambda\phi$, $\Xi\phi$, and $\Sigma K^\ast$ hadronic molecular states, respectively. Other constructions are interpreted as hadronic molecular states composed of excited states with the same quantum numbers, and some of these exhibit mass values that align with known resonances listed in the RPP(PDG). Our numerical results indicate that $\Lambda(2050)3/2^-$ and $\Xi(2250)$ should be the multiplet partner of each other. Additionally, although $\Sigma K^\ast$ bound state was identified under this framework, no corresponding partner states were found within the context of the currents we constructed. Alternative constructions may offer new possibilities for identifying such states.</description>

      <title>Parton model contributions as next-to-eikonal corrections to the dipole factorization of DIS and SIDIS at low $x_{Bj}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the next-to-eikonal (NEik) power corrections to inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) at low $x$ beyond dipole factorization, which represent the eikonal result. The analysis is restricted to contributions arising from t-channel quark exchanges, thereby probing the quark background field of the target. For a transversely polarized virtual photon, the NEik corrections to inclusive DIS are expressed in terms of quark and antiquark collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs), while the corresponding corrections to SIDIS are formulated in terms of the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum-dependent distribution (TMD). In contrast, for a longitudinally polarized photon, the NEik corrections to both inclusive DIS and SIDIS vanish at lowest order in $\alpha_{s}$.</description>

      <title>Perturbations to $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry due to renormalization group running effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry is an attractive flavour symmetry in lepton mixing, which accommodates maximal values of atmospheric mixing angle ($\theta_{23}=\pi/4$) and Dirac CP phase ($\delta=\pi/2/3\pi/2$). Another significance of this symmetry is that it does not constrain $\theta_{13}$ to be zero. As the recent results from $T2K$ and $NO\nu A$ experiments indicate a near-maximal value of the Dirac CP phase, the role of $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry becomes more prominent. In this work, we study RG running effects as a perturbation to the $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry. Assuming the symmetry to be preserved at the seesaw scale, we study the deviations of mass eigenvalues and lepton mixing parameters at the electroweak scale due to RG running. We derive the one-loop RGEs of the mass eigenvalues and mixing parameters and solve them numerically. Numerical analysis shows that the deviations from $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry are consistent with $3\sigma$ range of global oscillation data.</description>

      <title>Flavor Symmetry and Proton Decay in PeV-Scale Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale offers several theoretical and phenomenological advantages, such as accommodating the observed Higgs mass and alleviating the flavor and CP problems. However, flavor and CP observables still impose stringent constraints even at the PeV scale, motivating a systematic study of flavor symmetries in this regime. In this work, we investigate nucleon decay induced by dimension-five operators in supersymmetric standard models and examine how flavor symmetries, particularly of the Froggatt-Nielsen type, can suppress these operators. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining flavor, CP, and proton-decay observables to quantify the allowed parameter space and identify characteristic predictions. Our results demonstrate that a multi-messenger approach, integrating flavor, CP, and baryon-number-violating observables, is essential for probing the underlying structure of supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale.</description>

      <title>Radiative decays of the $\Omega(2012)$ as a hadronic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the radiative decay process $\Omega(2012) \to \gamma \Omega$, where the $\Omega(2012)$ resonance with spin-parity $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$, is treated as a dynamically generated state from $\bar{K}\Xi(1530)$ and $\eta \Omega$ in $s$-wave and $\bar{K}\Xi$ in $d$-wave. The radiative decay width of the $\Omega(2012)$ is calculated using a triangular loop mechanism, where the $\Omega(2012)$ couples to the $\bar{K} \Xi(1530)$ channel. Subsequently, the final state interactions between $\Xi(1530)$ and $\bar{K}$ transition to a photon and $\Omega$ through the exchange of a $\Xi$ baryon. Our calculations yield a radiative decay width of $13.2 ^{+4.5}_{-3.9}$ KeV, with uncertainties arising from the model parameters. This result provides valuable insights into the nature of the $\Omega(2012)$ resonance and its decay dynamics. It is expected that the calculations presented here could be verified by future experiments, which would open a new door for studying the still elusive nature of the $\Omega(2012)$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the strong vertices of hadronic molecules $DK$, $D^*K$, $DK^*$ and their bottom analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the strong vertices of hadronic molecules $DK$, $D^*K$, $DK^*$ and their bottom analogs within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. The coupling between interpolating currents and low spin particles is considered in the phenomenological side, and the vacuum condensates $\left\langle \bar qq \right\rangle ,\left\langle g_s^2GG \right\rangle ,\left\langle \bar qg_s\sigma Gq \right\rangle ,\left\langle g_s^3GGG \right\rangle ,{\left\langle \bar qq \right\rangle ^2}$ are included in the QCD side. As an application of strong coupling constants, we also obtain the partial decay widths of these states, where $\Gamma_{T_{DK}\rightarrow D_s\pi}=10.3_{-2.9}^{+3.0}\mathrm{KeV}$,
  $\Gamma_{T_{D^*K}\rightarrow D_s^*\pi}=24.8_{-5.4}^{+5.5}\mathrm{KeV}$, $\Gamma_{T_{BK}\rightarrow BK}=101_{-21}^{+36}\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{T_{B^*K}\rightarrow B^*K}=142_{-25}^{+52}\mathrm{MeV}$. It is shown that the results of $\Gamma_{T_{DK}\rightarrow D_s\pi}$ and $\Gamma_{T_{D^*K}\rightarrow D_s^*\pi}$ are compatible with the experimental data of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$.</description>

      <title>Unified Origin of Dirac Neutrino and Asymmetric Dark Matter Masses via a Dirac-Type Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple and unified framework that simultaneously explains the origins of light Dirac neutrino masses, asymmetric dark matter (ADM), and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. The model is based on an extended $U(1)_X$ Froggatt-Nielsen--like mechanism, which naturally generates suppressed Yukawa couplings and realizes a Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses. An additional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry stabilizes the dark sector, where chiral fermions charged under $\mathbb{Z}_4$ serve as ADM candidates. Leptogenesis occurs through the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Dirac neutrinos, where the generated asymmetry is shared between the visible and dark sectors due to exact lepton-number conservation. The same suppression mechanism that explains the smallness of neutrino masses also determines the GeV-scale ADM mass. Numerical studies demonstrate that a fully asymmetric DM scenario is realized, consistent with relic abundance, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and direct detection constraints. This framework provides an experimentally testable connection between neutrino physics, dark matter, and baryogenesis within an anomaly-free setup.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Invariant Gravitational Waves from Cogenesis in a $B-L$ Conserving Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of baryogenesis and stochastic gravitational wave production is presented for an extension of the standard model where the dark sector consists of dark matter particles charged under a $U(1)_x$ gauge symmetry, while a subset of dark fields also carry lepton number but no $U(1)_x$ charge. We demonstrate that with CP violation induced by Yukawa couplings, equal and opposite lepton asymmetries are generated in the visible and hidden sectors. Subsequent evolution preserves lepton number separately in each sector, and sphaleron interactions partially convert the lepton asymmetry into baryon asymmetry near the temperature of the first-order phase transition. Further, we discuss stochastic gravitational wave background production for the first-order phase transition using a gauge-independent bubble nucleation dynamics which yields spectra also valid in the supercooled low-temperature regime with {$T_p/m_{A_x} \ll 1$} where $T_p$ is the percolation temperature and $m_{A_x}$ is the dark photon mass. A parameter-space scan identifies regions that simultaneously account for cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter and predict stochastic gravitational wave signals within reach of current (NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA) and future detectors at higher frequencies, providing a unified framework for cogenesis and associated gravitational wave production.</description>

      <title>First simultaneous analysis of transverse momentum dependent and collinear parton distributions in the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first simultaneous global QCD analysis of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent (TMD) and collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the proton. Our study incorporates data from deep-inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan, inclusive weak boson, $W$+\,charm, and jet production involving PDFs, as well as TMD Drell-Yan and $Z$-boson production data from fixed target and collider experiments sensitive to both TMD and collinear distributions. The analysis is performed at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy for QCD resummation in TMD observables and next-to-leading order for observables described in collinear factorization. The combined analysis improves knowledge of both TMD and collinear PDFs, particularly in the sea-quark sector, providing a consistent simultaneous description of the aforementioned observables.</description>

      <title>On the maximum compactness of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar compactness, that is, the dimensionless ratio between the mass and radius of a compact star, $\mathcal{C} := M/R$, plays a fundamental role in characterising the gravitational and nuclear-physics aspects of neutron stars. Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: ``how compact can a neutron star be?'' remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking. However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for the maximum compactness and is given by $\mathcal{C}_{\rm max} = 1/3$. Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.</description>

      <title>The String Theory Photoverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String theory compactifications come with numerous $U(1)$ factors, implying the presence of many hidden photons in the low-energy EFT. One may call this the ``string photoverse''. We argue that, generically, these hidden photons are massless and do not couple to any light dark current such that, naively, kinetic mixing with the Standard Model is unobservable. The leading interactions of these ``superhidden'' photons are then dimension-6 dipole operators which couple them to quarks or leptons and the Higgs field. This induces magnetic and electric dipole moments with respect to both the superhidden photons as well as, through kinetic mixing, to the Standard Model photon. We derive these couplings by dimensionally reducing the fermionic action of 7-branes realizing the Standard Model: In the first step to 6d theories on intersection curves and then, in the presence of fluxes, to our 4d chiral EFT. We analyze how experiments and observations can employ this effect to place lower bounds on the string scale, which is relevant for compactifications with very large volumes. Finally, we briefly discuss how supersymmetry implies the presence of relatively light photinos and hence an accompanying ``photinoverse'', which may be observed via renormalizable mixing effects.</description>

      <title>When Tiny Halos Stir Spacetime: Gravitational Waves from Fifth-Force Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter fermions interacting via attractive fifth forces mediated by a light mediator can form dark matter halos in the very early universe. We show that bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual halos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo binaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at initially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency bands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the resulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations to distinguish them from conventional ones. Notably, even if only a tiny fraction of dark matter experiences strong fifth-force interactions, such effects provide a new avenue to discover self-interacting dark matter through GW observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protons and neutrons are the building blocks of matter, glued together in nuclei by strong interactions. They can be excited by pions, real and virtual photons, neutrinos and other probes. These excitations are referred to as light baryon resonances. A short, pedagogical overview of the field is presented including experimental progress, interpretation of light baryon resonances, and a focus on analysis methods to extract the resonance spectrum from data.</description>

      <title>Search potential for $\tilde{b}_{1} \rightarrow t W \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$ via $\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}$ at the LHC and HL-LHC, with multi-lepton signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search potential for sbottom pair production in an R-parity conserving scenario is explored in multi-lepton final states at LHC Run-3 and the HL-LHC. In this model, the sbottom decays via a chargino, $\tilde{b}_1 \to t \tilde{\chi}_1^\pm$, with a branching ratio (BR) of 100%. The chargino subsequently decays into a $W$ boson and the lightest neutralino, $\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm \to W \tilde{\chi}_1^0$, also with a BR of 100%. Two mass configurations are considered for $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$: a fixed value of 50 GeV, and a scenario where $\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm$ is 100 GeV heavier than $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$. The study follows the ATLAS object definitions and event selection criteria as detailed in Refs.1-3, extending the analysis presented in Ref. 2. Results are presented as projected exclusion limits in the $\tilde{b}_1$-$\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ and $\tilde{b}_1$-$\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm$ mass planes for three center-of-mass energies (13 TeV, 13.6 TeV, and 14 TeV) and three integrated luminosity scenarios (139 fb$^{-1}$, 300 fb$^{-1}$, and 3000 fb$^{-1}$). Depending on the $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ mass assumption, sbottom masses up to 1.28 TeV can be excluded at the HL-LHC with 3000 fb$^{-1}$. These projections highlight the impact of alternative mass configurations on the sensitivity of multi-lepton \sbsbModel searches and provide guidance for future strategies targeting challenging SUSY scenarios at the LHC.</description>

      <title>The Formation Rate and Luminosity Function of Fast X-ray transients from Einstein probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following its launch on January 9, 2024, the Einstein Probe (EP) telescope has detected hundreds of fast X-ray transients (FXTs), yet their physical origins remain elusive. Understanding their luminosity function and formation rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Based on the latest catalog of EP-detected FXTs, we present, a model-independent, non-parametric approach to derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{46}$ erg/s. The formation rate exhibits a gentle decline with redshift, following the relation $(1+z)^{-0.21}$, yielding a local rate of approximately $28.0_{-16.4}^{+27.3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is comparable to that of low-luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Our findings indicate a potential correlation between FXTs and LGRBs, supporting the majority of FXTs may be linked to collapsar progenitors.</description>

      <title>Hyperons and $\Delta$'s in rotating protoneutron stars: Local properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation, neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions, temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances) and rapid rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature, whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical. Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\ \mathrm{km} &lt; R_e &lt; 13.5\ \mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements. These findings constrain the EoS, requiring a self-consistent treatment of rotation, mass-dependent compression, and composition-driven modeling to accurately model protoneutron star evolution in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Mass and spin coevolution of black holes inspiralling through dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In extreme/intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (E/IMRIs) embedded in dark-matter (DM) spikes, the secondary black hole can accrete collisionless particles from the surrounding halo. We study how the companion's spin controls this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane. Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from dynamical friction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-step phase transition provides a paradigm in which a broken symmetry during phase transition can be restored, enriching the phenomena of both dark matter and baryon asymmetry. We study the dynamics of the multi-step phase transition in the standard model extension with additional isospin $N$-plet scalar field $\Phi_2$ under a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We find that the multi-step phase transition could be triggered if there is a moderately large coupling between the Higgs and the $\Phi_2$ and this coupling is required to be larger as the mass of the $\Phi_2$ and/or isospin increase. The first-order phase transition at the first (second) step can be realized by the thermal loop (tree-level barrier) effects. Thus it is more likely that a detectable spectrum of gravitational waves can be produced at the second step of the phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the time reversal (T) transformation in neutrino oscillations in a model-independent way by comparing the observed transition probabilities at two different baselines at the same neutrino energy. We show that, under modest model assumptions, if the transition probability $P_{\nu_\mu\to\nu_e}$ around $E_\nu \simeq 0.86$ GeV measured at DUNE is smaller than the one at T2HK the T symmetry has to be violated. Experimental requirements needed to achieve good sensitivity to this test for T violation are to obtain enough statistics at DUNE for $E_\nu \lesssim 1$ GeV (around the 2nd oscillation maximum), good energy resolution (better than 10%), and near-detector measurements with a precision of order 1% or better.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic linear waves and breakdown of the momentum expansion in spin magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate spin magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by including the magnetic-flux and total angular momentum conservation laws in the hydrodynamic framework. To specify the local angular momentum conservation, we choose the totally antisymmetric spin current. The entropy-current analysis allows for ten dissipative first-order transport coefficients including anisotropic spin relaxation rates and the conversion rate between a vorticity (shear) to a symmetric stress (antisymmetric torque), as well as anisotropic viscosities and resistivities. By employing the linear-mode analysis, we solve the first-order spin MHD equations to determine the dispersion relations with the complete information of anisotropy retained. Our analytic solutions indicate that the small-momentum expansion is spoiled by blow up of the higher-order terms when the angle between the momentum and the magnetic field approaches the right angle. This also reveals the existence of another expansion parameter, and, in light of it, we provide solutions in an alternative series expression beyond the critical angle. We confirm that these two series expansions work well in the appropriate angle ranges as compared with numerical results. Building on our findings regarding the breakdown of the small-momentum expansion in first-order theory, we proceed to discussing how these first-order solutions are modified when we include the relaxation dynamics for dissipative modes with the Israel-Stewart framework. We find that, due to the presence of the critical behavior in the first-order solutions, there remains a diffusive window even after the relaxation dynamics is introduced.</description>

      <title>Generic framework for non-perturbative QCD in light hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>

      <title>CGAN-Based Framework for Meson Mass and Width Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesons play a crucial role in understanding the strong interaction in the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, the mass and decay width of several ordinary and exotic mesons remain experimentally undetermined. In this work, we propose a novel application of advanced machine learning techniques to deal with this challenge. Due to the limited available meson datasets, traditional data-driven methods are norm To overcome this, we employ a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate synthetic meson data based on known physical parameters. This not only augments the dataset but also retain the underlying physics of the original mesons data. With the extended dataset, we train multiple copies of CGAN and apply a bagging technique to predict uncertainties, improving the robustness and reliability of the predictions. As our findings indicate, the CGAN models are capable of well describing meson properties and their structure relations, offering a potent novel instrument for hadron spectroscopy. This calculation opens a promising future for data-driven hadron physics studies.</description>

      <title>Spin oscillations of neutrinos scattered by the supermassive black hole in the galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation and spin oscillations of neutrinos in their scattering by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a realistic accretion disk. We review various descriptions of the fermion spin evolution in a curved spacetime under the influence of external fields. The overview of the test particle motion in the gravitational field of a rotating SMBH is also present. The external fields which a neutrino spin interacts with are the electroweak forces in plasma and the toroidal magnetic field in the accretion disk surrounding SMBH. Spin precession of neutrinos, which are supposed to be Dirac particles, is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. We use a semi-analytical model of a thick accretion disk and review its characteristics. The cases of co-rotating and counter-rotating disks with respect to BH are discussed. We consider the incoming flux of neutrinos having an arbitrary angle with respect to the BH spin since the recent results of the Event Horizon Telescope indicate that the BH spin in the galactic center is not always perpendicular to the galactic plane. For our study, we consider a large number of incoming test neutrinos. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Implications of recent LHCb data on CPV in b-baryon four body decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01853v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent CPV observation, we investigate the CPV of b-baryon charmless four body decays under the U-spin symmetry. However, we find that only U-spin symmetry cannot provide effective predictions, particularly for $\Lambda_b$ decays. For giving more useful predictions, we also give a simple dynamic analysis. By counting the power($\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{\Lambda_{QCD}}{m_b}}$) of each topological diagram, we find that for the specific decay $B_b^2\to R(B_1^2 M^2 M^{\bar 2})M^2$, only one U-spin amplitude can contribute in the leading power, while for $B_b^2\to R(B_1^2 M^2)R( M^{\bar 2}M^2)$, only two U-spin amplitudes can contribute in this leading power. Then the most effective prediction can be given as \begin{align}
  &amp;A_{CP}^{dir}(\Lambda_b^0 \to R( p \pi^- \pi^+ )\pi^-) = (-12.99 \pm 2.83\pm2.59\pm0.65)\%,\notag \end{align} Considering the $\Lambda_b$ can effectively produced in LHCb, we strongly encourage a more precise experimental investigation of it.</description>

      <title>New chiral structures for baryon number violating nucleon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the most general nucleon decay interactions that involve three light quarks without being acted upon by a derivative. We identify four generic operator structures that correspond to the irreducible representations in the chiral group ${\rm SU(3)}_{\tt L}\otimes {\rm SU(3)}_{\tt R}$ of QCD, \{$\pmb{8}_{\tt L}\otimes \pmb{1}_{\tt R}$, $\bar{\pmb{3}}_{\tt L}\otimes \pmb{3}_{\tt R}$, $\pmb{6}_{\tt L}\otimes \pmb{3}_{\tt R}$, $\pmb{10}_{\tt L}\otimes \pmb{1}_{\tt R}$\}, plus their chirality partners under the interchange of chiralities ${\tt L}\leftrightarrow {\tt R}$. While half of them have been extensively discussed in the literature, the other half, $\pmb{6}_{\tt L(R)}\otimes \pmb{3}_{\tt R(L)}$ and $\bar{\pmb{10}}_{\tt L(R)}\otimes \pmb{1}_{\tt R(L)}$, are identified for the first time. We perform chiral matching for these interactions at the leading chiral order and find that each has a unique chiral realization in terms of the octet baryons and pseudoscalars. Notably, the chiral interaction in the $\pmb{6}_{\tt L(R)}\otimes \pmb{3}_{\tt R(L)}$ representation appears at the same chiral order as those of the known ones, while the one in the $\pmb{10}_{\tt L(R)}\otimes \pmb{1}_{\tt R(L)}$ representation appears at a higher chiral order. These new structures are prevalent in effective field theories and ultraviolet models, and they offer novel experimental avenues to search for baryon number violating nucleon decays.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytical solution for the evolution of parton distributions incorporating mixed-order QCD $\otimes$ QED corrections, addressing both polarized and unpolarized cases. Using the Altarelli-Parisi kernels extended to mixed order, we solve the DGLAP equations exactly in Mellin $N$-space and derive the associated Wilson coefficients for the polarized structure function $g_1$. Our analytical approach not only improves computational efficiency but also enhances the precision of theoretical predictions relevant for current and future phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Production and Baryogenesis in a Simple Left-Right model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The left-right model with the simplest Higgs structure has a $SU(2)_L$ doublet $H_L$, a $SU(2)_R$ doublet $H_R$, and a singlet $\sigma$ that couples to the doublets as $\sigma(|H_L|^2-|H_R|^2)$. The left-right symmetry has $H_L\leftrightarrow H_R$ and $\sigma\leftrightarrow-\sigma$. We study gravitational wave production and baryogenesis in the electroweak phase transitions in the model. For two benchmark points, $\sigma$ first gets a vev, followed by $H_R$ and then $H_L$. An interesting feature is that the vev of $H_L$ is initially much higher than its zero temperature value, leading to a more strongly first-order transition and higher frequency gravitational waves. An unusual benchmark point has the $\sigma$ vev at zero when the electroweak symmetry breaks. This results in both $H_L$ and $H_R$ vevs being equal and in the multi-TeV range. At a lower temperature, the $\sigma$ vev turns on, breaking the left-right symmetry and $H_L$ drops to its standard model value. Since the electroweak symmetry is broken at the multi-TeV scale, the frequency of gravitational waves will be much higher than usual. Baryogenesis is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study magnetic properties of the Hadron Resonance Gas in the presence of a strong ($0 \le B \le 0.15~{\rm GeV}^2$) uniform magnetic field, using physical values of the magnetic moments of hadrons, i.e., including their anomalous parts. The values of these moments are taken from experiment, or when unavailable, from theoretical estimates. We evaluate the conserved charge susceptibilities, finding the expected sizable effects of the anomalous magnetic moments, in particular of the octet baryons, such as the proton and neutron, where they are exceptionally large. We also study in detail the large effects of the magnetic moments of the $\Delta(1232)$ states, for which various theoretical estimates and experimental values differ significantly. We compare our model results with the lattice QCD data and find reasonable agreement within the model uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: We suggest a universal QCD-motivated expression for the Polyakov-KNO multiplicity distributions of hadrons in jets and compare it with data from $e^+e^-$ annihilation experiments. The moments and overall shape of the distributions in full events and quark and gluon jets, over a range of energies, are described with reasonable quantitative precision. In particular, the scaling violation predicted by QCD is seen clearly in the moments and high-multiplicity fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present rephasing invariant formulae $\delta^{(\alpha i)} = \arg [ { V_{\alpha 1} V_{\alpha 2} V_{\alpha 3} V_{1i} V_{2i} V_{3i} / V_{\alpha i }^{3} \det V } ] $ for CP phases $\delta^{(\alpha i)}$ associated with nine Euler-angle-like parameterizations of a flavor mixing matrix. Here, $\alpha$ and $i$ denote the row and column carrying the trivial phases in a given parameterization. Furthermore, we show that the phases $\delta^{(\alpha i)}$ and the nine angles $\Phi_{\alpha i}$ of unitarity triangles satisfy compact sum rules $ \delta^{(\alpha, i+2)} - \delta^{(\alpha, i+1)} = \Phi_{\alpha-2, i} - \Phi_{\alpha-1, i}$ and $ \delta^{(\alpha-2, i)} - \delta^{(\alpha-1, i)} = \Phi_{\alpha, i+2} - \Phi_{\alpha, i+1}$ where all indices are taken cyclically modulo three. These twelve relations are natural generalizations of the previous result $\delta_{\mathrm{PDG}}+\delta_{\mathrm{KM}}=\pi-\alpha+\gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the partonic origin of the proton longitudinal spin using spin-dependent energy correlator measured in lepton-hadron collisions with longitudinally polarized proton beams. These observables encode angular correlations in energy flow and are sensitive to the spin-momentum structure of confined partons. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns in both nearly back-to-back and forward limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with longitudinally polarized transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) and nucleon energy correlators (NECs). The TMDs and NECs allow consistent matching onto hard radiation region, and provide a comprehensive description of the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint $\text{N}^{3}$LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for spin-dependent energy correlation patterns in the current and target fragmentation regions (CFR and TFR). The framework provides new theoretical insight into how the internal motion and spin of partons contribute to the formation of the proton longitudinal spin, and offers an experimental paradigm for probing the interplay between color confinement and spin dynamics at forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>How large are hadronic contributions to $h \to \gamma \gamma$?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of the Higgs boson into two photons, $h \to \gamma \gamma$, is a loop-induced process within the Standard Model, predominantly mediated by loops of $W$ bosons and top quarks. While these leading contributions are well understood, the role of hadronic effects, which arise from non-perturbative QCD dynamics, has received less attention, with recent studies reporting puzzling and contradictory results. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of the hadronic contributions to the $h \to \gamma \gamma$ decay width using dispersion relations. Our analysis shows that these contributions are exceedingly small, as expected, altering the decay width by at most about $0.004\%$ under conservative assumptions. Therefore, hadronic effects can be safely neglected even in the context of future high-precision Higgs measurements at current and next-generation colliders. As an aside, we also estimate the possible size of hadronic contributions to Higgs production in gluon-gluon fusion.</description>

      <title>Search for the $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ Molecular State $X_{2}(4013)$ in $K^{-}p$ and $pp$ Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the interpretation of $X(3872)$ as a $D\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state, heavy-quark spin symmetry predicts a spin-2 partner, $X_{2}(4013)$, which can be regarded as a $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ molecule with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$. Its experimental confirmation, however, remains elusive. In this work, we investigate the production mechanisms of $X_{2}(4013)$ in the reactions $K^{-}p \to \Lambda_{c}^{+} D_{s}^{-} X_{2}(4013)$ and $pp \to \Lambda_{c}^{+}\Lambda_{c}^{+} X_{2}(4013)$ within an effective Lagrangian framework. The production processes are modeled via $t$-channel $D/\bar{D}^{*}$ meson exchanges, while initial-state interactions (ISI) mediated by Pomeron and Reggeon exchanges are also taken into account. Our calculations indicate that the total cross sections can reach the pb level, suggesting that $X_{2}(4013)$ may be accessible at current and future experiments such as AMBER@CERN and LHCb. Inclusion of ISI enhances the cross sections by nearly one order of magnitude. The differential distributions show distinct angular behaviors for the two reactions: the $K^{-}p$ reaction exhibits a forward-peaked distribution, whereas the $pp$ reaction shows a dip near central angles. This study provides a quantitative theoretical benchmark for future experimental searches of $X_2(4013)$ and highlights the importance of initial-state interactions (ISI) in high-energy particle investigations.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in QCD, we investigate field-strength correlations in both SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD. In the Euclidean Landau gauge, we numerically calculate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \perp)) \rangle$ with $\perp \equiv x, y$, and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \parallel) \rangle$ with $\parallel~\equiv z, t$. In the Landau gauge, all two-point field-strength correlations $g^2 \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$ are described by these two quantities, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same point of $r=0$. The parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to an approximate cancellation for the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \simeq 0$. Next, we decompose the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$. The quadratic term is always negative, which is explained by the Yukawa-type gluon propagator $\langle A^a_\mu(s)A^a_\mu(s')\rangle \propto e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ in the Landau gauge. The quartic term gives a relatively small contribution. In the infrared region, the cubic term is positive and tends to cancel with the quadratic term, resulting in a small value of $C_{\perp}(r)$.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity constraints with Planck ISW-lensing bispectrum</title>

Abstract: We present updated constraints on modified gravity by including the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from CMB lensing-CMB temperature cross-correlations, based on the latest Planck PR4 maps. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy approach and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we find that including the CMB ISW lensing cross-correlations tighten constraints on the modified gravity parameters by approximately $20\%$, reducing the viable parameter space by $40-80\%$. We derive constraints from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI DR1 BAO, CMB ISW-lensing, and type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data. The constraints on the EFT parameters controlling the kinetic braiding and non-minimal coupling are consistent with General Relativity (GR) at the $95\%$ CL. In particular, we obtain a bound on the kinetic braiding parameter, $c_B &lt; 1.2$ at $95\%$ CL. In the $w_0$-$w_a$ parameter space, our results imply a crossing of the phantom divide, $w=-1$. The modified gravity model shows a mild preference over $\Lambda$CDM at the $1.8\sigma$, $2.6\sigma$ and $3.2\sigma$ levels for the combinations with Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 supernova datasets. We find that using the latest $\texttt{HiLLiPoP}+\texttt{LoLLiPoP}$ likelihoods alleviates the departure of modified gravity parameters from the GR-values compared to results using {\it Planck} 2018 data. This paper underlines the importance of the ISW lensing probe in constraining late-time modifications of gravity.</description>

      <title>20 GeV halo-like excess of the Galactic diffuse emission and implications for dark matter annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07209</link>

Abstract: Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60^\circ$, $10^\circ \le |b| \le 60^\circ$) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a spectral peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which contains non-template patches adjusted to match the observed map. The halo excess spectrum can be fitted by annihilation with a particle mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and quantum fluctuations of horizon area</title>

Abstract: The event horizon is a source of irreversibility, analogous to statistical irreversibility. This is why for systems with an event horizon there is no difference between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Quantum processes of quantum tunneling determine the thermodynamics of these systems, their temperatures, entropies and fluctuations. We considered three examples of entropy variance that support this point of view: (i) the variance of the area of the black hole horizon, obtained by consideration of quantum fluctuations; (ii) the variance of the entropy of the Hubble volume in the de Sitter state, obtained by consideration of thermal fluctuations; and (iii) the variance of entropy in integers in the Planckon model, determined by the Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>Extra-natural production of superheavy Kaluza-Klein particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge fields in extra compact dimensions can drive inflation in the four-dimensional (4D) non-compact spacetime, a scenario known as extra-natural inflation. A time-dependent gauge field configuration generates the electric field along the compact dimension, enabling the production of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles charged under the field via the Schwinger effect. We construct the extra-natural inflation model within a five-dimensional (5D) quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework coupled to gravity including matter fields that generate the inflationary one-loop effective potential. In general, multiple charged fields can exist, and we show that KK particle production occurs under these conditions. Since KK momentum is conserved, the produced KK particles may become superheavy dark matter or dominate the universe, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we show that even when the gauge field acts not as the inflaton but as a spectator field, its post-inflationary oscillations, initiated when the Hubble friction becomes negligible, can also generate superheavy KK modes. This suggests that KK particle production is a generic outcome when gauge potentials along compact dimensions are light.</description>
