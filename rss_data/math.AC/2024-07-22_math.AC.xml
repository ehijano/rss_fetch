      <title>The v-numbers and linear presentations of ideals of covers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $J=I_c(G)$ be its ideal of covers. The aims of this work are to study the {\rm v}-number ${\rm v}(J)$ of $J$ and to study when $J$ is linearly presented using combinatorics and commutative algebra. We classify when ${\rm v}(J)$ attains its minimum and maximum possible values in terms of the vertex covers of the graph that satisfy the exchange property. If the cover ideal of a graph has a linear presentation, we express its v-number in terms of the covering number of the graph. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for the graph $\mathcal{G}_J$ of $J$ to be connected. One of our main theorems shows that if $G$ has no induced 4-cycles, then $J$ is linearly presented. To prove this theorem, we show three results about unmixed K\"onig graphs related to some results already in the literature. For unmixed graphs without $3$- and $5$-cycles, we classify combinatorially when $J$ is linearly presented, and show that the columns of the linear syzygy matrix of $J$ are linearly independent if and only if $\mathcal{G}_J$ has no strong $3$-cycles.</description>

      <title>Prime and maximal ideals in Hurwitz polynomial rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study prime and maximal ideals in a Hurwitz polynomial ring hR. It is well-known that to study many questions we may assume R is prime and consider just R-disjoint ideals. We give a characterization for an R-disjoint ideal to be prime. We study conditions under which there exists an R-disjoint ideal which is a maximal ideal and when this is the case how to determine all such maximal ideals. maximal ideal to be generated by polynomials of minimal degree.</description>

      <title>The reciprocal complement of a polynomial ring in several variables over a field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The *reciprocal complement* $R(D)$ of an integral domain $D$ is the subring of its fraction field generated by the reciprocals of its nonzero elements. Many properties of $R(D)$ are determined when $D$ is a polynomial ring in $n\geq 2$ variables over a field. In particular, $R(D)$ is an $n$-dimensional, local, non-Noetherian, non-integrally closed, non-factorial, atomic G-domain, with infinitely many prime ideals at each height other than $0$ and $n$.</description>

      <title>A Yannakakis-type theorem for lifts of affine semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yannakakis' theorem relating the extension complexity of a polytope to the size of a nonnegative factorization of its slack matrix is a seminal result in the study of lifts of convex sets. Inspired by this result and the importance of lifts in the setting of integer programming, we show that a similar result holds for the discrete analog of convex polyhedral cones-affine semigroups. We define the notions of the integer slack matrix and a lift of an affine semigroup. We show that many of the characterizations of the slack matrix in the convex cone setting have analogous results in the affine semigroup setting. We also show how slack matrices of affine semigroups can be used to obtain new results in the study of nonnegative integer rank of nonnegative integer matrices.</description>

      <title>Bounds for syzygies of monomial curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a numerical semigroup. In this paper, we prove an upper bound for the Betti numbers of the semigroup ring of G which depends only on the width of G, that is, the difference between the largest and the smallest generator of G. In this way, we make progress towards a conjecture of Herzog and Stamate. Moreover, for 4-generated numerical semigroups, the first significant open case, we prove the Herzog-Stamate bound for all but finitely many values of the width.</description>

Abstract: We notice the connection between almost Cohen-Macaulay rings and the Cohen-Macaulay defect. We introduce a Serre-type condition for modules, that is connected to the Cohen-Macaulay defect in the same way that the condition $(S_n)$ is connected to Cohen-Macaulay modules.</description>

      <title>Cancellation and splitting of Symplectic modules in the critical range and Euler class group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the cancellation and splitting of the symplectic modules. The symplectic cancellation result presented here can be thought of as an analog of the Projective module cancellation result of Fasel. The symplectic splitting is similar to Murthy's splitting theorem. To prove the cancellation and splitting, we carefully analyze the Postnikov towers in the $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy category. Then we prove the vanishing of top cohomology with coefficients in some homotopy sheaf. As another application of the vanishing results, we answer partially a question of Mrinal Das about the isomorphism of $(d-1)$-th Euler class group and $(d-1)$-th Chow group, where $d$ is the dimension of the underlying smooth affine variety.</description>

      <title>Numerical semigroups, polyhedra, and posets IV: walking the faces of the Kunz cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical semigroup is a cofinite subset of $\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}$ containing $0$ and closed under addition. Each numerical semigroup $S$ with smallest positive element $m$ corresponds to an integer point in the Kunz cone $\mathcal C_m \subseteq \mathbb R^{m-1}$, and the face of $\mathcal C_m$ containing that integer point determines certain algebraic properties of $S$. In this paper, we introduce the Kunz fan, a pure, polyhedral cone complex comprised of a faithful projection of certain faces of $\mathcal C_m$. We characterize several aspects of the Kunz fan in terms of the combinatorics of Kunz nilsemigroups, which are known to index the faces of $\mathcal C_m$, and our results culminate in a method of "walking" the face lattice of the Kunz cone in a manner analogous to that of a Gr\"obner walk. We apply our results in several contexts, including a wealth of computational data obtained from the aforementioned "walks" and a proof of a recent conjecture concerning which numerical semigroups achieve the highest minimal presentation cardinality when one fixes the smallest positive element and the number of generators.</description>
