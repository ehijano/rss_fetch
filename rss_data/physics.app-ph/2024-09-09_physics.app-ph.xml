      <title>Determination of dynamic flow stress equation based on discrete experimental data: Part 1 Methodology and the dependence of dynamic flow stress on strain-rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a framework to determine the dynamic flow stress equation of materials based on discrete data of varied (or instantaneous) strain-rate from split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiments is proposed. The conventional constant strain-rate requirement in SHPB test is purposely relaxed to generate rich dynamic flow stress data which are widely and diversely distributed in plastic strain and strain-rate space. Two groups of independent SHPB tests, i.e. Group A (without shaper) and Group B (with shaper) were conducted on the C54400 phosphor-bronze copper alloy at room temperature, obtaining flow stress data (FSD) (two-dimensional (2D) matrix). Data qualification criteria were proposed to screen the FSD, with which qualified FSD were obtained. The qualified FSD of Group A were coarsely filled with missing data and were reconstructed by the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). As a result, finely-filled FSD of Group A were obtained, which were carefully evaluated by the qualified FSD of Group B. The evaluation proves the effectiveness of ANN in FSD prediction. Next, the finely-filled FSD from Group A were decomposed by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method. Discrete and analytical flow stress equation f(strain, strain-rate)_ana were obtained from the SVD results. Finally, flow stress equation (f(strain, strain-rate)_MJC) based on conventional method were established. Five uncertainties inherent in the conventional method in the determination of the flow stress equation were identified. The comparison between f(strain, strain-rate)_ana and f(strain, strain-rate)_MJC demonstrated the effectiveness and reliability of the flow stress equation obtained from the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive exploration of quasisymmetric stellarators and their coil sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We augment the `QUAsi-symmetric Stellarator Repository' (QUASR) to include vacuum field stellarators with quasihelical symmetry using a globalized optimization workflow. The database now has almost 370,000 quasisaxisymmetry and quasihelically symmetric devices along with coil sets, optimized for a variety of aspect ratios, rotational transforms, and discrete rotational symmetries. This paper outlines a couple of ways to explore and characterize the data set. We plot devices on a near-axis quasisymmetry landscape, revealing close correspondence to this predicted landscape. We also use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data so that it can easily be visualized in two or three dimensions. Principal component analysis also gives a mechanism to compare the new devices here to previously published ones in the literature. We are able to characterize the structure of the data, observe clusters, and visualize the progression of devices in these clusters. These techniques reveal that the data has structure, and that typically one, two or three principal components are sufficient to characterize it. QUASR is archived at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10050655 and can be explored online at quasr.flatironinstitute.org.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Acoustics of the Chinese Transverse Flute (dizi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the acoustical characteristics of the Chinese transverse flute, the dizi, employing input impedance measurements, modeling and analysis. The input impedances for various fingerings of a bangdi in the key of F, a particular type of the dizi, are measured and compared to models using both the transfer matrix method and the Transfer Matrix Method with external Interaction (TMMI). In order to get more accurate modeling results, we provide specific transfer matrices for the unique components of the dizi, such as back end-holes, membrane hole and upstream branch. The matching volume length correction for holes drilled in a thick wall is also derived. Comparative analysis of modeling and measurement data validates the improved accuracy of TMMI, confirming the influence of radiated sound from closely spaced toneholes.</description>

      <title>Apparatus for producing single strontium atoms in an optical tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline an experimental setup for efficiently preparing a tweezer array of $^{88}$Sr atoms. Our setup uses permanent magnets to maintain a steady-state two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) which results in a loading rate of up to $10^{8}$ s$^{-1}$ at 5 mK for the three-dimensional blue MOT. This enables us to trap $2\times10^{6}$ $^{88}$Sr atoms at 2 $\mu$K in a narrow-line red MOT with the $^{1}$S$_{0}$ $\rightarrow$ $^{3}$P$_{1}$ intercombination transition at 689 nm. With the Sisyphus cooling and pairwise loss processes, single atoms are trapped and imaged in 813 nm optical tweezers, exhibiting a lifetime of 2.5 minutes. We further investigate the survival fraction of a single atom in the tweezers and characterize the optical tweezer array using a release and recapture technique. Our platform paves the way for potential applications in atomic clocks, precision measurements, and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Energy Shift with Coupling (ESC): a new quench protection method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quench protection of full-size high-field accelerator magnets poses significant challenges. Maintaining the hot-spot temperature and peak voltage-to-ground within acceptable limits requires a protection system that quickly transitions most of the coil turns to the normal state. Existing magnet protection technologies, such as quench protection heaters or the Coupling Loss Induced Quench system (CLIQ), have been successfully applied. However, they both present shortcomings since they require either thin insulation between the heaters and the magnet conductor or direct electrical connections to the magnet coil. A novel quench protection method, Energy Shift with Coupling (ESC), is presented which can achieve excellent quench protection performance without the above-mentioned drawbacks. ESC relies on normal-conducting auxiliary coils strongly magnetically coupled with the magnet coils to protect. Upon quench detection capacitive units connected across such coils introduce a high current change in the auxiliary coils causing a rapid shift of magnet stored energy from the magnet coils to the auxiliary coils. This has three beneficial effects: sudden reduction of ohmic loss in the normal zone of the magnet conductor, introduction of high transient losses in the magnet conductor, thus causing a quick transition to the normal state, and extraction of a part of the magnet stored energy to the auxiliary coils. The applicability of the ESC concept on an existing magnet design is analyzed with electromagnetic and thermal transient simulations performed with the STEAM-LEDET program. The advantages and disadvantages of ESC are discussed and compared to other conventional quench protection methods. Simulation results show that ESC can be applied to protect full-scale magnets with reasonable requirements in terms of size and location of the auxiliary coils and of capacitive unit parameters.</description>

      <title>Localization of macroscopic sources of magnetic field using optical fibers doped with NV-rich sub-micron diamonds and zero-field resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ an optical fiber doped with randomly oriented fluorescent sub-micron diamonds and the novel zero-field resonance protocol to collect information on the localization and orientation of a magnetic-field source and its distribution. Many previous demonstrations of diamond-based magnetic field sensing achieved ultrahigh sensitivities down to the fT range warranted by manipulating spin states of the diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers with externally applied radio or microwaves. The application of such oscillating fields is problematic in distributed magnetic-field measurements and may be incompatible with specific targets. Instead of relying on these approaches, we leveraged cross-relaxations of particular spin-state populations of the NV center under a magnetic field, thus observing zero-field resonances and making external radio frequency fields redundant. Combined with an optical fiber sensitive to the magnetic field along its entire length, remote sensing was realized that returned information on the spatial field distribution without using any moving mechanical elements in the detection system. Variation of the spatial parameters of the investigated field was achieved simply by controlling the current in a pair of induction coils easily integrable with optical fibers without limiting the fiber-specific functionality of the optical readout taking place at a fixed location at the optical fiber output. Lifting of the requirements related to the mechanical scanning of the fiber, the application of external fields, and the orientation of the NV centers against the measured field mark a very practical step forward in optically driven magnetic field sensing, not easily achievable with earlier implementations.</description>

      <title>Impact of external magnetic fields on STT-MRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This application note discusses the working principle of spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive random access memory (STT-MRAM) and the impact that magnetic fields can have on STT-MRAM operation. Sources of magnetic field and typical magnitudes of magnetic fields are given. Based on the magnitude of commonly encountered external magnetic fields, we show below that magnetic immunity of STT-MRAM is sufficient for most uses once the chip is mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) or inserted in its working environment. This statement is supported by the experience acquired during 60 years of use of magnetic hard disk drives (HDD) including 20 years of HDD with readers comprising magnetic tunnel junctions, 20+ years of use of magnetic field sensors as position encoders in automotive industry and 15+ years of use of MRAM. Mainly during chip handling does caution need to be exercised to avoid exposing the chip to excessively high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Real-time optical gas sensing with two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.</description>

      <title>A geometric condition for robot-swarm cohesion and cluster-flock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric design rule for size-controlled clustering of self-propelled particles. Active particles that tend to rotate under an external force have an intrinsic signed-parameter with units of curvature, which we term curvity, derivable from first principles. Robot experiments and numerical simulations show that the properties of the individual robot alone -- radius and curvity -- control pair-cohesion in a binary system as well as the stability of flocking and clustering in a swarm. Our results have applications in meta-materials and embodied decentralized control.</description>

      <title>Highly polarized single photon emitter from intrinsic localized excitons in a WSe2/CrSBr heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single photons emitters (SPEs) are key components in quantum information applications and are commonly generated in 2D materials by inhomogeneous strain engineering. Here, we report an alternative approach that involves a 2D semiconductor/2D magnet heterostructure. The optical study of the WSe2/CrSBr heterostructures reveals several new emission lines at lower energies compared to characteristic WSe2 emissions, that are assigned to localized excitons. Further investigation demonstrates that one of these emergent lines is an SPE with a strong valley polarization response and large energy shift with the field-induced metamagnetic transition in CrSBr, linking it to the magnetic proximity effect of the adjacent CrSBr layer. In contrast to previous reports on WSe2 that only allow tuning of the SPEs by out-of-plane magnetic field, our emitter is sensitive to both in- and out-of-plane fields. Our findings demonstrate the potential of this approach for improved control and polarization of SPEs in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of atom interrogation using photonic integrated circuits anodically bonded to ultra-high vacuum envelopes for epoxy-free scalable quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable integration of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) into quantum sensors has the potential to drastically reduce sensor size, ease manufacturing scalability, and improve performance in applications where the sensor is subject to high accelerations, vibrations, and temperature changes. In a traditional quantum sensor assembly, free-space optics are subject to pointing inaccuracies and temperature-dependent misalignment. Moreover, the use of epoxy or sealants for affixing either free-space optics or PICs within a sensor vacuum envelope leads to sensor vacuum degradation and is difficult to scale. In this paper, we describe the hermetic integration of a PIC with a vacuum envelope via anodic bonding. We demonstrate utility of this assembly with two proof-of-concept atom-interrogation experiments: (1) spectroscopy of a cold-atom sample using a grating-emitted probe; (2) spectroscopy of alkali atoms using an evanescent field from an exposed ridge waveguide. This work shows a key process step on a path to quantum sensor manufacturing scalability</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of oscillators is ubiquitous in nature. Often, the synchronized oscillators couple directly, yet in some cases synchronization can arise from their parametric interactions. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the parametric synchronization of a dissipative Kerr soliton frequency comb. We specifically show that the parametric interaction between the soliton and two auxiliary lasers permits the entrainment of the frequency comb repetition rate. Besides representing the first prediction and demonstration of parametric synchronization of soliton frequency combs, our scheme offers significant flexibility for all-optical metrological-scale stabilization of the comb.</description>

      <title>Effects of Interfacial Oxygen Diffusion on the Magnetic Properties and Thermal Stability of Pd/CoFeB/Pd/Ta Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the effects of annealing temperatures (TA) on a Pd (5 nm)/CoFeB (10 nm)/Pd (3 nm)/Ta (10 nm) multilayer structure. The as-deposited sample showed an amorphous state with in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA), resulting in low coercivity and moderate damping constant ({\alpha}) values. Increasing TA led to crystallization, forming bcc-CoFe (110) crystals, which increased in-plane coercivity and introduced isotropic magnetic anisotropy, slightly reducing the {\alpha}. The two-fold UMA persists up to 600 C, and the thermal stability of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy remains intact even TA = 700 C. The TA significantly influenced the magnetic properties such as in-plane saturation magnetization (Ms//), in-plane and out-of-plane coercivities, and in-plane effective magnetic anisotropy energy density (Keff). Above 600 C, Keff decreased, indicating a transition towards uniaxial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Interfacial oxidation and diffusion from the Ta capping layer to the Pd/CoFeB/Pd interfaces were observed, influencing chemical bonding states. Annealing at 700 C, reduced oxygen within TaOx through a redox reaction involving Ta crystallization, forming TaB, PdO, and BOx states. Ferromagnetic resonance spectra analysis indicated variations in resonance field (Hr) due to local chemical environments. The {\alpha} reduction, reaching a minimum at 300 C annealing, was attributed to reduced structural disorder from inhomogeneities. Tailoring magnetic anisotropy and spin dynamic properties in Pd/CoFeB/Pd/Ta structures through TA-controlled oxygen diffusion/oxidation highlights their potential for SOT, DMI, and magnetic skyrmion-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>18 GHz Solidly Mounted Resonator in Scandium Aluminum Nitride on SiO2/Ta2O5 Bragg Reflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reports an acoustic solidly mounted resonator (SMR) at 18.64 GHz, among the highest operating frequencies reported. The device is built in scandium aluminum nitride (ScAlN) on top of silicon dioxide (SiO2) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) Bragg reflectors on silicon (Si) wafer. The stack is analyzed with X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD). The resonator shows a coupling coefficient (k2) of 2.0%, high series quality factor (Qs) of 156, shunt quality factor (Qp) of 142, and maximum Bode quality factor (Qmax) of 210. The third-order harmonics at 59.64 GHz is also observed with k2 around 0.6% and Q around 40. Upon further development, the reported acoustic resonator platform can enable various front-end signal-processing functions, e.g., filters and oscillators, at future frequency range 3 (FR3) bands.</description>

      <title>Integral Micromorphic Model Reproducing Dispersion in 1D Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper develops a new integral micromorphic elastic continuum model, which can describe dispersion properties of band-gap metamaterials, i.e., metamaterials that inhibit propagation of waves in a certain frequency range. The enrichment consists in nonlocal averaging of three terms in the expression for the potential energy density of the standard micromorphic continuum. After proper calibration, such a formulation can exactly reproduce two given branches of the dispersion curve (acoustic and optical), even in cases with a band gap. The calibration process exploits Fourier images of the unknown weight functions, which are analytically deduced from the dispersion relation of the material of interest. The weight functions are then reconstructed in the spatial domain by numerical evaluation of the inverse Fourier transform. The presented approach is validated on several examples, including a discrete mass-spring chain with two alternating masses, for which the dispersion relation has an explicit analytical form and the optical and acoustic branches are separated by a band gap.</description>

Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional membrane-in-the-middle model for a cavity that consists of two fixed, perfect mirrors and a mobile dielectric membrane between them that has a constant electric susceptibility. We present a sequence of exact cavity angular frequencies that we call structural angular frequencies and that have the remarkable property that they are independent of the position of the membrane inside the cavity. Furthermore, the case of a thin membrane is considered and simple, approximate formulae for the angular frequencies and for the modes of the cavity are obtained. Finally, the cavity electromagnetic potential is numerically calculated and it is found that the potential is accurately described by a multiple scales solution.</description>

      <title>PINN surrogate of Li-ion battery models for parameter inference. Part I: Implementation and multi-fidelity hierarchies for the single-particle model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17329</link>

Abstract: To plan and optimize energy storage demands that account for Li-ion battery aging dynamics, techniques need to be developed to diagnose battery internal states accurately and rapidly. This study seeks to reduce the computational resources needed to determine a battery's internal states by replacing physics-based Li-ion battery models -- such as the single-particle model (SPM) and the pseudo-2D (P2D) model -- with a physics-informed neural network (PINN) surrogate. The surrogate model makes high-throughput techniques, such as Bayesian calibration, tractable to determine battery internal parameters from voltage responses. This manuscript is the first of a two-part series that introduces PINN surrogates of Li-ion battery models for parameter inference (i.e., state-of-health diagnostics). In this first part, a method is presented for constructing a PINN surrogate of the SPM. A multi-fidelity hierarchical training, where several neural nets are trained with multiple physics-loss fidelities is shown to significantly improve the surrogate accuracy when only training on the governing equation residuals. The implementation is made available in a companion repository (https://github.com/NREL/pinnstripes). The techniques used to develop a PINN surrogate of the SPM are extended in Part II for the PINN surrogate for the P2D battery model, and explore the Bayesian calibration capabilities of both surrogates.</description>

      <title>PINN surrogate of Li-ion battery models for parameter inference. Part II: Regularization and application of the pseudo-2D model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian parameter inference is useful to improve Li-ion battery diagnostics and can help formulate battery aging models. However, it is computationally intensive and cannot be easily repeated for multiple cycles, multiple operating conditions, or multiple replicate cells. To reduce the computational cost of Bayesian calibration, numerical solvers for physics-based models can be replaced with faster surrogates. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is developed as a surrogate for the pseudo-2D (P2D) battery model calibration. For the P2D surrogate, additional training regularization was needed as compared to the PINN single-particle model (SPM) developed in Part I. Both the PINN SPM and P2D surrogate models are exercised for parameter inference and compared to data obtained from a direct numerical solution of the governing equations. A parameter inference study highlights the ability to use these PINNs to calibrate scaling parameters for the cathode Li diffusion and the anode exchange current density. By realizing computational speed-ups of 2250x for the P2D model, as compared to using standard integrating methods, the PINN surrogates enable rapid state-of-health diagnostics. In the low-data availability scenario, the testing error was estimated to 2mV for the SPM surrogate and 10mV for the P2D surrogate which could be mitigated with additional data.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first half of the paper we consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate the "sound" wave coefficient of reflection from (coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the speeds of the "sound" waves relative to the shock and the wave impedances. In the second half of the paper we explicitly include into consideration the dissipation in the system, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to justify the conditions on the shocks, postulated in the first half of the paper. This also allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles, same as the profiles of the waves closely connected with the shocks - the kinks. The profiles of the latter, and in some particular cases the profiles of the former, were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>
