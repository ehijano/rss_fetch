      <title>Dissipation Dilution-Driven Topology Optimization for Maximizing the $Q$ Factor of Nanomechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality factor ($Q$ factor) of nanomechanical resonators is influenced by geometry and stress, a phenomenon called dissipation dilution. Studies have explored maximizing this effect, leading to softly-clamped resonator designs. This paper proposes a topology optimization methodology to design two-dimensional nanomechanical resonators with high $Q$ factors by maximizing dissipation dilution. A formulation based on the ratio of geometrically nonlinear to linear modal stiffnesses of a prestressed finite element model is used, with its corresponding adjoint sensitivity analysis formulation. Systematic design in square domains yields geometries with comparable $Q$ factors to literature. We analyze the trade-offs between resonance frequency and quality factor, and how these are reflected in the geometry of resonators. We further apply the methodology to optimize a resonator on a full hexagonal domain. By using the entire mesh -- i.e., without assuming any symmetries -- we find that the optimizer converges to a two-axis symmetric design comprised of four tethers.</description>

      <title>Thermal magnetoresistance from magnon scattering from a domain wall in an antiferromagnetic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnon heat transport in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator containing a domain wall (DW) in the presence of a magnetic field applied along the easy axis. We show that the intrinsic spin of the DW couples to the external magnetic field which modifies the transmission of spin wave (SW) through the DW. Applying the magnetic field lifts the degeneracy between two AFM magnon modes and results in different occupation numbers for the two magnon modes. Combined with the finite reflection of a narrow domain wall, this is found to have a significant impact on the magnon heat transport, giving rise to thermal magnetoresistance. Our findings suggest that an AFM DW can be used as a controllable element for regulating the magnon heat current in magnonic devices through the application of a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretical analysis of skyrmion dynamics at finite temperature in a box -- a simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the classical dynamics and flow of information in an interacting two-skyrmion system confined in a box at finite temperature. Using numerical simulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the skyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting the system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Through the analysis of information-theoretical quantities, we elucidate the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of information flow. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function of time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the two skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the characteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size divided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the information transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information and the time to write the information.</description>

      <title>A Discrete Formulation of Second Stiefel-Whitney Class for Band Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological invariants in band theory are often formulated assuming that Bloch wave functions are smoothly defined over the Brillouin zone (BZ). However, first-principles band calculations typically provide Bloch states only at discrete points in the BZ, rendering standard continuum-based approaches inapplicable. In this work, we focus on the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2$, a key $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant under PT symmetry that characterizes various higher-order topological insulators and nodal-line semimetals. We develop a fully discrete, gauge-fixing-free formula for $w_2$ which depends solely on the Bloch states sampled at discrete BZ points. Furthermore, we clarify how our discrete construction connects to lattice field theory, providing a unifying perspective that benefits both high-energy and condensed matter approaches.</description>

      <title>Observation of on- and off-resonant interaction between a solid-state spin qubit and a superconducting resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid systems consisting of multiple materials with distinct physical properties and tunable interactions provide a promising route for fulfilling transformative quantum innovations. Solid-state spin qubits and superconducting circuits stand out as leading candidates in this context due to their complementary device performance and quantum mechanical properties. Here, we report experimental integration of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spin qubit and an on-chip superconducting resonator for realizing multimodal quantum applications. Specifically, we have observed superconductivity enhanced NV spin relaxation, which shows a similar Hebel-Slichter peak feature around the phase transition point. In the coherent interaction regime, we show that the superconducting resonator mode is capable of exciting NV Rabi oscillations. Taking advantage of scanning NV magnetometry, we further visualized microscopic electromagnetic behaviors of the superconducting resonator, revealing the formation and evolution of superconducting vortices at the nanoscale. Our results highlight the potential of harnessing NV centers and superconducting circuits for designing hybrid systems to advance the burgeoning quantum revolution. The current study will also open a new pathway to test and evaluate miniaturized superconducting electronics for their future design and performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nonrelativistic spin current polarization in an altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin current plays a central role in spintronics for driving exotic spin-dependent phenomena and high-performance device applications. Recently, a magnetic spin Hall effect has been discovered in spin-split antiferromagnets including noncollinear antiferromagnets and altermagnets, allowing the efficient generation of unconventional spin currents even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. However, although such nonrelativistic spin currents are proposed to have a magnetic origin, the direct connection between the Neel vector and the spin current polarization is still missing. Here, using the altermagnetic RuO2 as a representative example, we unveil the spin current polarization by disentangling the conventional and magnetic spin Hall effects using a technique we developed based on the spin Hall magnetoresistance measurement. The results suggest that the nonrelativistic spin current hosts a polarization very close to the Neel vector. Our work offers unambiguous evidence of the magnetic origin of the nonrelativistic spin current in altermagnetic RuO2, and paves a straightforward route to understand the unconventional spin currents that are crucial in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Slow water in engineered nano-channels revealed by color-center-enabled sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale confinement of molecules in a fluid can result in enhanced viscosity, local fluidic order, or collective motion. Confinement also affects ion transport and/or the rate and equilibrium concentration in a chemical reaction, all of which makes it the subject of broad interest. Studying these effects, however, is notoriously difficult, mainly due to the lack of experimental methods with the required sensitivity and spatial or time resolution. Here we leverage shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the dynamics of room-temperature water molecules entrapped within ~6-nm-tall channels formed between the diamond crystal and a suspended hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake. NV-enabled nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of confined water protons reveal a much reduced H2O self-diffusivity, orders of magnitude lower than in bulk water. We posit the slow dynamics stem from the accumulation of photogenerated carriers at the interface and trapped fluid, a notion we support with the help of molecular dynamics modeling. Our results provide feedback for theories describing interfacial water, and lay out a route for investigating other fluids under confinement.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Elastocaloric Effects in {\gamma}-graphyne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global emphasis on sustainable technologies has become a paramount concern for nations worldwide. Specifically, numerous sustainable methods are being explored as promising alternatives to the well-established vapor-compression technologies in cooling and heating devices. One such avenue gaining traction within the scientific community is the elastocaloric effect (eC). This phenomenon holds promise for efficient cooling and heating processes without causing environmental harm. Studies carried out at the nanoscale have demonstrated the efficiency of the eC, proving to be comparable to that of state-of-the-art macroscopic systems. In this study, we used classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the elastocaloric effect for {\gamma}-graphyne. Our analysis goes beyond obtaining changes in eC temperature and the coefficient of performance (COP) for two species of {\gamma}-graphyne nanoribbons (armchair and zigzag). We also explore their dependence on various conditions, including whether they are on deposited on a substrate or pre-strained. Our findings reveal a substantial enhancement in the elastocaloric effect for {\gamma}-graphyne nanoribbons when subjected to pre-strain, amplifying it by at least one order of magnitude. Under certain conditions, the change in the eC temperature and the COP of the structures reach expressive values as high as 224 K and 14, respectively. We discuss the implications of these results by examining the shape and behavior of the carbon-carbon bond lengths within the structures.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced delocalization in flat-band systems with quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of flat-band systems by analyzing a one-dimensional metal/flat-band/metal junction constructed on a Lieb lattice with an infinite band gap. Our study reveals that disorders can induce delocalization and enable the control of transmission through quantum geometry. In the weak disorder regime, transmission is primarily mediated by interface-bound states, whose localization length is determined by the quantum geometry of the system. As disorder strength increases, a zero-energy transmission channel - absent in the clean system - emerges, reaches a maximum, and then diminishes inversely with disorder strength in the strong disorder limit. In the strong disorder regime, the transmission increases with the localization length and eventually saturates when the localization length becomes comparable to the link size. Using the Born approximation, we attribute this bulk transmission to a finite velocity induced by disorder scattering. Furthermore, by analyzing the Bethe-Salpeter equation for diffusion, we propose that the quantum metric provides a characteristic length scale for diffusion in these systems. Our findings uncover a disorder-driven delocalization mechanism in flat-band systems that is fundamentally governed by quantum geometry. This work provides new insights into localization phenomena and highlights potential applications in designing quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Chiral States in Multi-Weyl Semimetals through Magneto-Optical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the transport parameters in multi-Weyl semimetals, focusing on their magneto-optical properties and the role of chiral states. The tilting parameter is identified as a key factor in higher-order Weyl nodes, significantly influencing the magneto-optical response. We obtain a generic Landau-level expression for multi-Weyl semimetals, establishing a robust framework for analyzing their quantum transport properties. A comprehensive expression for the conductivity tensor components is presented, uncovering distinctive low-frequency peaks and other features shaped by the tilting parameter. Our findings reveal that the signatures of chiral states in the conductivity tensors become increasingly pronounced with the Weyl node order. Particularly, the tilting parameter is shown to impact Faraday rotation, at energies near the tilted Dirac cone energies. These results provide critical insights into the magneto-optical behavior of multi-Weyl semimetals and their potential for exploring topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Piezomagnetic Effects in $g$-wave Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the generation of net magnetization induced by lattice distortion due to elastic waves in $g$-wave altermagnets, which exhibit the symmetric spin-split band structure under collinear spin textures free from the relativistic spin--orbit coupling. By analyzing a tight-binding model in a two-dimensional tetragonal system, we show that the $g$-wave altermagnets give rise to the nonlinear piezomagnetic effect, where a net magnetization is induced by the second-order strain. We compare the results for the $g$-wave altermagnets with those for the $d$-wave altermagnets, where the linear piezomagnetic effect occurs. As a result, we find that the induced magnetization is enhanced when the Fermi level lies on the band with the large spin splitting in both cases. We also show that the magnitudes of the induced magnetization are comparable to each other. Our results indicate that the nonlinear piezomagnetic effect is a good phenomenon to characterize the physical properties in $g$-wave altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Large enhancement of spin-flip scattering efficiency at Y3Fe5O12/Pt interfaces due to vertical confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons, the quanta of spin angular momentum, can be excited in magnetic insulators by spin-flip scattering processes originated from currents applied to a heavy metal overlayer. The efficiency to generate non-equilibrium magnons across interfaces is parametrized by the spin conductance gs, a phenomenological constant that is considered to be dependent on thermal magnons. Here, we investigate non-linear magnetoresistance phenomena originated in Pt due to current-driven nonequilibrium magnons in Y3Fe5O12 (YIG). Remarkably, we find that spin-flip scattering processes are dominated by subthermal magnons at room temperature, resulting in a large modulation of gs with the magnetic field and YIG thickness. Concretely, we find that decreasing the YIG thickness from 100 to 10 nm increases gs by a factor 30 and observe that the magnetic field exponentially suppresses the magnon generation efficiency. These findings challenge current understanding on gs and indicate that electrically-driven magnonic effects such as damping compensation and magnon condensation can be largely boosted by device miniaturization.</description>

      <title>DPmoire: A tool for constructing accurate machine learning force fields in moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In moir\'e systems, the impact of lattice relaxation on electronic band structures is significant, yet the computational demands of first-principles relaxation are prohibitively high due to the large number of atoms involved. To address this challenge, We introduce a robust methodology for the construction of machine learning potentials specifically tailored for moir\'e structures and present an open-source software package DPmoire designed to facilitate this process. Utilizing this package, we have developed machine learning force fields (MLFFs) for MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) materials. Our approach not only streamlines the computational process but also ensures accurate replication of the detailed electronic and structural properties typically observed in density functional theory (DFT) relaxations. The MLFFs were rigorously validated against standard DFT results, confirming their efficacy in capturing the complex interplay of atomic interactions within these layered materials. This development not only enhances our ability to explore the physical properties of moir\'e systems with reduced computational overhead but also opens new avenues for the study of relaxation effects and their impact on material properties in two-dimensional layered structures.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of non-trivial magnetization textures from magnetic field images using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial imaging of magnetic stray fields from magnetic materials is a useful tool for identifying the underlying magnetic configurations of the material. However, transforming the magnetic image into a magnetization image is an ill-poised problem, which can result in artefacts that limit the inferences that can be made on the material under investigation. In this work, we develop a neural network fitting approach that approximates this transformation, reducing these artefacts. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach allows the inclusion of additional models and bounds that are not possible with traditional reconstruction methods. These advantages allow for the reconstruction of non-trivial magnetization textures with varying magnetization directions in thin-film magnets, which was not possible previously. We demonstrate this new capability by performing magnetization reconstructions on a variety of topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetic susceptibility of type-I, II, and III massless Dirac fermions in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbital magnetic susceptibility of tilted massless Dirac fermions in two dimensions. It is well-known that the type-I massless Dirac fermions exhibit divergingly-large diamagnetic susceptibility, whereas less is known about the types II and III cases. We first clarify that the orbital magnetic susceptibility is vanishing for the types II and III in the continuum model. We then compare the three types of Dirac fermions for the lattice models. We employ three tight-binding models with different numbers of Dirac points, all of which are two-band models defined on a square lattice. For all three models, we find that the type-I Dirac fermions show the divergingly-large orbital diamagnetic susceptibility, whereas the type-II Dirac fermions exhibit non-diverging paramagnetic susceptibility. The type-III Dirac fermions exhibit diamagnetism but its susceptibility is small compared with the type-I case.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport through Asymmetrical Molecular channel Azulene: Role of Orbital Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate electron transport through azulene molecule with four distinct electrode contact geometries using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism within the tight-binding Hamiltonian. Employing the Q-matrix approach, we analyze quantum interference (QI) among the molecular orbitals in each contact configuration. Our results reveal distinct transmission profiles and varying current responses among configurations, with the configuration 1-3 displaying the highest conductivity at higher bias due to strong constructive interference of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO). Conversely, configuration 5-7 exhibit weak conductance and antiresonance at the Fermi energy, attributed to dominant destructive interference among the frontier molecular orbitals. Configuration 2-6 is found to exhibit asymmetric I-V characteristics, due to the dipolar nature of the azulene molecule. These findings underscore the significance of QI effects in shaping the transport properties of azulene, and molecule-based devices in general.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Robust Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect via Entropy-Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of quantum materials and tailoring of their functional properties is a fundamental interest in materials science. Here we propose a new design concept for robust quantum anomalous Hall effect via entropy engineering in 2D magnets. As a prototypical example, configurational entropy of monolayer transition metal trihalide VCl$_3$ is manipulated by incorporating four different transition-metal cations [Ti,Cr,Fe,Co] in the honeycomb structure made of vanadium, such that all the in-plane mirror symmetries, inversion and/or roto-inversion are broken. Monolayer VCl$_3$ is a ferromagnetic Dirac half-metal in which spin-polarized Dirac dispersion at valley momenta is accompanied by bulk states at the $\Gamma$-point and thus the spin-orbit interaction driven quantum anomalous Hall phase does not exhibit fully gapped bulk band dispersion. Entropy-driven bandstructure renormalization, especially band flattening in combination with red and blue shifts at different momenta of the Brillouin zone and crystal-field effects, transforms Dirac half-metal to a Dirac spin gapless semiconductor and leads to a robust quantum anomalous Hall phase with fully gapped bulk band dispersion, and thus, a purely topological edge state transport without mixing with dissipative bulk channels. These findings provide a paradigm to design entropy-driven 2D materials for the realization of robust quantum anomalous Hall effect and quantum device applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear valley Hall effect in a bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valley-contrasting Hall transport conventionally relies on the inversion symmetry breaking in two-dimensional systems, which greatly limits the selection range of valley materials. In particular, while monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides have been widely utilized as a well-known class of valley materials in valleytronics, the centrosymmetric nature hinders the realization of valley-contrasting properties in the bilayer counterparts. Here, taking MoS$_{2}$ as an example, we discover valley-contrasting transport in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides by exploring nonlinear transport regime. Using effective models and first-principles calculations, our work demonstrates that nonvanishing nonlinear valley Hall conductivities emerge in a uniaxially strained MoS$_{2}$ bilayer, owing to strain-induced band tilts of Dirac fermions. With the aid of small spin-orbit-coupling induced band splittings, the conduction bands generate much remarkable nonlinear valley Hall conductivity. Moreover, the nonlinear conductivities are highly tunable through modulating the strength and the direction of the strain, chemical potential, and interlayer gap. Our findings not only expands material choices for valleytronic applications, but also provides opportunities for designing advanced electronic devices that leverage nonlinear valley transports.</description>

      <title>Magnon-Phonon Coupling in Layered Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical model of hybridization between magnon, and phonons observed experimentally in magneto-Raman scattering in van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (AFM). Here, the representative material, FePS3, has been shown to be a quasi-two-dimensional-Ising antiferromagnet, with additional features of spin-phonon coupling in the Raman spectra emerging below the N\'eel temperature (TN) of approximately 120 K. Using magneto-Raman spectroscopy as an optical probe of magnetic structure, we show that one of these Raman-active modes in the magnetically ordered state is a magnon with a frequency of 3.7 THz (~ 122 cm-1). In addition, one magnon band and three phonon bands are coupled via the magneto-elastic coupling evidenced by anti-crossing in the complete spectra. We consider a simple model involving only in-plane nearest neighbor exchange couplings (designed to give rise to a similar magnetic structure) and perpendicular anisotropy in presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field. Exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian leads to energy bands which show that the interaction term gives rise to avoided crossings between the hybridized magnon and phonon branches. Realizing magnon-phonon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) AFMs is important for the verification of the theoretical predictions on exotic quantum transport phenomena like spin-caloritronics, topological magnonics, etc.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Chern insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiplicative Chern insulators (MCIs) as canonical examples of multiplicative topological phases of matter. Constructing the MCI Bloch Hamiltonian as a symmetry-protected tensor product of two topologically non-trivial parent Chern insulators (CIs), we study two-dimensional (2D) MCIs and introduce 3D mixed MCIs, constructed by requiring the two 2D parent Hamiltonians share only one momentum component. We study the 2D MCI response to time reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm effect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via the effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this response, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological invariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting higher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of bulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of the child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological skyrmion phase.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Band Flattening in Twisted Bilayer of M-Valley MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental studies on moir\'e materials have predominantly focused on twisted hexagonal lattice with low-energy states near the $\Gamma$- or K-points. These materials, characterized by isotropic low-energy dispersion, are fundamentally distinct from those with anisotropic properties. Here we introduce a series of semiconducting transition metal carbides (MXenes) $M_2$C$T_2$ ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf, Sc, Y; $T$ = O, F, Cl) as a novel platform for M-valley moir\'e materials. Take Ti$_2$CO$_2$ and Zr$_2$CO$_2$ as representative examples, large-scale \emph{ab initio} calculations show that their AB-stacked twisted homobilayer features three three-fold rotational symmetry related M-valleys with time-reserval symmetry and giant anisotropic band flattening. We derive a simplified moir\'e Hamiltonian for these systems and conduct a detailed analysis of their band structures, where the origins of anisotropic band flattening are clearly elucidated. This research broadens the scope of moir\'e materials, where the valley- and spin-degenerate two-dimensional array of quasi-one-dimensional system could serve as a potential platform for realizing many interesting correlated phases.</description>

      <title>Interplay of quantum statistics and self-interference in extended colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision of quantum particles remains an effective way of probing their mutual statistics. Colliders based on quantum point contacts in quantum Hall edge states have been successfully used to probe the statistics of the underlying quantum particles. Notwithstanding the extensive theoretical work focusing on point-like colliders, when it comes to experiment, the colliders are rarely point-like objects and can support a resonant level or multiple tunneling points. We present a study of a paradigmatic extended (non-point-like) fermionic collider which is readily generalized to colliding bosons. As with particle interferometers, in an extended collider there is an infinite number of trajectories for any single or multi-particle event. Self-interference of the former can lead to an apparent bunching of fermions when we compare the cross-current correlator with the classical benchmark representing two active sources. In view of this apparent bunching behavior of fermions, we identify an irreducible cross-current correlator which reveals the true mutual statistics of fermions.</description>

      <title>g-factor theory of Si/SiGe quantum dots: spin-valley and giant renormalization effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the $g$-factor physics of Si/SiGe quantum dots is crucial for realizing high-quality spin qubits. While previous work has explained some aspects of $g$-factor physics in idealized geometries, the results do not extend to general cases and they miss several important features. Here, we construct a theory that gives $g$ in terms of readily computable matrix elements, and can be applied to all Si/SiGe heterostructures of current interest. As a concrete example, which currently has no $g$-factor understanding, we study the so-called Wiggle Well structure, containing Ge concentration oscillations inside the quantum well. Here we find a significant renormalization of the $g$-factor compared to conventional Si/SiGe quantum wells. We also uncover a giant $g$-factor suppression of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$, which arises due to spin-valley coupling, and occurs at locations of low valley splitting. Our work therefore opens up new avenues for $g$-factor engineering in Si/SiGe quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the local elemental arrangements across the interfaces inside CdSe/Cd1-xZnxS core-shell and CdSe/CdS/ Cd1-xZnxS core-crown-shell quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a systematic study of the Cd, Zn, Se, and S elemental distributions across the interfaces in CdSe/Cd1-xZnxS core-shell and CdSe/CdS/Cd1-xZnxS core-crown-shell quantum wells with the CdSe core thickness ranging from 3.5 to 5.5 ML. By processing the XAS data, we observe that the Cd-Se bonds dominate at the CdSe/Cd1-xZnxS core-shell interface of structures with the 3.5 ML cores, while the Cd-Se bonds were more abundant in the cases of the 4.5 and 5.5 ML cores. The complementary information about prevailing bonds were extracted for other constituting elements, thus, describing the distribution of the elements at the core-shell interface of CdSe-based NPLs. The naked CdSe cores are covered with an organic shell via bridging oxygen atoms. Also, we address the issue of stability of such core-shell systems over the time. We demonstrate that after a half year of aging of the commercial-ready 4.5 ML CdSe/CdxZn1-xS NPLs, the Cd-Se bonds become more evident due to the partial degradation of the Cd-S bonds. This is the first experimental assessment of prevailing interatomic bonds at the core-shell interface in the CdSe-based NPLs of incremental structural heterogeneity, providing factual evidences about the elemental arrangement inside the core-crown-shell NPLs and the growth path of crowns and shells.</description>

      <title>Engineering whispering gallery modes in MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ double heterostructure nanocavities: Towards developing all-TMDC light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have emerged as highly promising materials for nanophotonics and optoelectronics due to their exceptionally high refractive indices, strong excitonic photoluminescence (PL) in monolayer configurations, and the versatility to engineer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In this work, we exploit the intense excitonic PL of a MoSe$_2$ monolayer combined with the high refractive index of bulk WS$_2$ to fabricate microdisk cavities with tunable light emission characteristics. These microdisks are created from a 50-nm-thick WS$_2$/MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ double heterostructure using frictional mechanical scanning probe lithography. The resulting cavities achieve a 4-10-fold enhancement in excitonic PL from the MoSe$_2$ monolayer at wavelengths near 800 nm. The excitonic PL peak is modulated by sharp spectral features, which correspond to whispering gallery modes (WGMs) supported by the cavity. A microdisk with a diameter of 2.35 $\mu$m demonstrates WGMs with a quality factor of up to 700, significantly surpassing theoretical predictions and suggesting strong potential for lasing applications. The spectral positions of the WGMs can be finely tuned by adjusting the microdisk's diameter and thickness, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. This approach offers a novel route for developing ultra-compact, all-TMDC double heterostructure light sources with record-small size.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Ultra-Stable Antiferromagnetic Two-Dimensional CrF3 Phase with Anisotropic Quasi-1D Mechanical, Electronic, and Thermal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</description>

      <title>Transmission and conductance across junctions of isotropic and anisotropic three-dimensional semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the transmission coefficients and zero-temperature conductance for chiral quasiparticles propagating through various geometries, which consist of junctions of three-dimensional nodal-point semimetals. In the first scenario, we consider a potential step with two Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl or two birefringent semimetals, which are tilted with respect to the other on the two sides of the junction. The second set-up consists of a junction between a doped Dirac semimetal and a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal, where an intrinsic magnetization present in the latter splits the doubly-degenerate Dirac node into a pair of Weyl nodes. A scalar potential is also applied in the region where the Weyl semimetal phase exists. Finally, we study sandwiches of Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals, with the middle region being subjected to both scalar and vector potentials. Our results show that a nonzero transmission spectrum exists where the areas, enclosed by the Fermi surface projections (in the plane perpendicular to the propagation axis) of the incidence and transmission regions, overlap. Such features can help engineer unidirectional carrier propagation, topologically protected against impurity backscattering, because of the chiral nature of the charge carriers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10763v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review, the thermoelectric properties in nodal-point semimetals with two bands are discussed. For the two-dimensional (2D) cases, it is shown that the expressions of the thermoelectric coefficients take different values depending on the nature of the scattering mechanism responsible for transport, by considering examples of short-ranged disorder potential and screened charged impurities. An anisotropy in the energy dispersion spectrum invariably affects the thermopower quite significantly, as illustrated by the results for a node of semi-Dirac semimetal and a single valley of graphene. The scenario when a magnetic field of magnitude $B$ is applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2D semimetal is also considered. The computations for three-dimensional (3D) cases necessarily involve the inclusion of nontrivial Berry phase effects. In addition to demonstrating the expressions for the response tensors, the exotic behaviour observed in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general framework for analyzing topology of quantum channels of single-particle systems is developed to find a class of genuinely dynamical topological phases that can be realized by means of discrete quantum feedback control. We provide a symmetry classification of quantum channels by identifying ten symmetry classes of discrete quantum feedback control with projective measurements. We construct various types of topological feedback control by using topological Maxwell's demons that achieve robust feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence. Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>Hall mass and transverse Noether spin currents in noncollinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) have recently attracted attention in the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics because of their various interesting properties. Due to the noncollinear magnetic order, the localized electron spins on different magnetic sublattices are not conserved even when spin-orbit coupling is neglected, making it difficult to understand the transport of spin angular momentum. Here we study the conserved Noether current due to spin-rotation symmetry of the local spins in noncollinear AFMs. Interestingly, we find that a Hall component of the spin current can be generically created by a longitudinal driving force associated with a propagating spin wave, inherently distinguishing noncollinear AFMs from collinear ones. We coin the corresponding Hall coefficient, an isotropic rank-4 tensor, as the Hall (inverse) mass, which generally exists in noncollinear AFMs and their polycrystals. The resulting Hall spin current can be realized by spin pumping in a ferromagnet (FM)-noncollinear AFM bilayer structure as we demonstrate numerically, for which we also give the criteria of ideal boundary conditions. Our results shed light on the potential of noncollinear AFMs in manipulating the polarization and flow of spin currents in general spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Fractal lattices, featuring the self-similarity symmetry, are often geometric descents of parent crystals, possessing all their discrete symmetries (such as rotations and reflections) except the translational ones. Here, we formulate three different general approaches to construct real space Hamiltonian on a fractal lattice starting from the Bloch Hamiltonian on the parent crystal, fostering for example strong and crystalline topological insulators resulting from the interplay between the nontrivial geometry of the underlying electronic wave functions and the crystal symmetries. As a demonstrative example, we consider a generalized square lattice Chern insulator model and within the framework of all three methods we successfully showcase incarnations of strong and crystalline Chern insulators on the Sierpi\'nski carpet fractal lattices. The proposed theoretical framework thus lays a generic foundation to build a tower of topological phases on the landscape of fractal lattices.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Reward-Driven Tuning of Scanning Probe Microscopy: Towards Fully Automated Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the dawn of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), tapping or intermittent contact mode has been one of the most widely used imaging modes. Manual optimization of tapping mode not only takes a lot of instrument and operator time, but also often leads to frequent probe and sample damage, poor image quality and reproducibility issues for new types of samples or inexperienced users. Despite wide use, optimization of tapping mode imaging is an extremely hard problem, ill-suited to either classical control methods or machine learning. Here we introduce a reward-driven workflow to automate the optimization of SPM in the tapping mode. The reward function is defined based on multiple channels with physical and empirical knowledge of good scans encoded, representing a sample-agnostic measure of image quality and imitating the decision-making logic employed by human operators. This automated workflow gives optimal scanning parameters for different probes and samples and gives high-quality SPM images consistently in the attractive mode. This study broadens the application and accessibility of SPM and opens the door for fully automated SPM.</description>

      <title>Signatures of topology in generic transport measurements for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the signatures of the topological properties of the bandstructures for nodal-point semimetals are embedded in the response coefficients, arising in two distinct experimental set-ups, by taking the Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal as an example. The first scenario involves the computation of third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the charge/thermal current densities to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field/temperature gradient. On the premises that internode scatterings can be ignored, the relaxation-time approximation leads to a quantized value for the nonvanishing components of each of these nonlinear response tensors, characterizing a single untilted RSW node. Furthermore, the final expressions turn out to be insensitive to the specific values of the chemical potential and the temperature. The second scenario involves computing the magnetoelectric conductivity under the action of collinear electric ($\mathbf E$) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields, representing a planar Hall set-up. In particular, our focus is in bringing out the dependence of the linear-in-$|\mathbf B|$ parts of the conductivity tensor on the intrinsic topological properties of the bandstructure, which are nonvanishing only in the presence of a nonzero tilt in the energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference Driven Electron Transport through Fano-Anderson Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic transport behavior of Fano-Anderson (FA) systems, consisting of a one-dimensional finite backbone chain and an attached side-group of varying length. The tight-binding model within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) reveals distinct interference patterns between the frontier orbitals of odd and even side-group systems that lead to distinct transport mechanisms across various configurations. The even side-group systems exhibit resonant tunneling peaks, while the odd ones demonstrate significant destructive interference at Fermi energy leading to antiresonance and reduced current responses. Further exploration of the role of electron-electron interactions within mean-field Hubbard Hamiltonian indicates the emergence of negative differential resistance (NDR) in odd side-group systems at lower biases, a phenomenon absent in the non-interacting case. Our study demonstrates the critical role of quantum interferences among the frontier molecular orbitals and electron correlations in shaping the transport behavior of FA systems, providing insights for the design of molecular-scale electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on pentalayer rhombohedral graphene moir\'e superlattices have observed the quantum anomalous Hall effect at moir\'e filling factor of $\nu = 1$ and various fractional values. These phenomena are attributed to a flat Chern band induced by electron-electron interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that at $\nu = 2$, many-body effects can lead to the emergence of quantum spin Hall and quantum valley Hall states, in addition to the quantum anomalous Hall state, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling or valley-dependent potentials. These three topological states can be selectively induced by the application and manipulation of a magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that at $\nu = 3$ and $4$, the ground state can be a combination of topologically trivial and nontrivial states, unlike the cases of $\nu=1$ and 2. This contrasts with the conventional quantum Hall effect in graphene where the ground state at filling factor $\nu$ is given as the particle-hole counterpart at $4-\nu$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Radiation Hardness of InAs/GaAs Quantum Dot Lasers for Space Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor lasers have great potential for space laser communication. However, excessive radiation in space can cause laser failure. In principle, quantum dot (QD) lasers are more radiation-resistant than traditional semiconductor lasers because of their superior carrier confinement and smaller active regions. However, the multifaceted nature of radiation effects on QDs resulted in ongoing controversies. Comprehensive testing under simulated space conditions is also necessary to validate their performance. In this work, we conducted radiation tests on various In(Ga)As/GaAs QD and quantum well (QW) materials and devices. Our results revealed that InAs/GaAs QDs with filling factors greater than 50% exhibit greater radiation hardness than those below 50%. Furthermore, most InAs/GaAs QDs showed superior radiation resistance compared to InGaAs/GaAs QW when exposed to low proton fluences of 1E11 and 1E12 cm-2, resulting from radiation-induced defects. The linewidth enhancement factor (LEF) of well-designed QD lasers remains remarkably stable and close to zero, even under proton irradiation at a maximum fluence of 7E13 cm-2, owing to their inherent insensitivity to irradiation-induced defects. These QD lasers demonstrate an exceptional average relative intensity noise (RIN) level of -162 dB/Hz, with only a 1 dB/Hz increase in RIN observed at the highest fluence, indicating outstanding stability. Furthermore, the lasers exhibit remarkable robustness against optical feedback, sustaining stable performance even under a feedback strength as high as -3.1 dB. These results highlight the significant potential of QD lasers for space laser communication applications, where high reliability and resilience to radiation and environmental perturbations are critical.</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Competing Orbital Magnetism and Superconductivity in electrostatically defined Josephson Junctions of Alternating Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism within a single material system represents a long-standing goal in condensed matter physics. Van der Waals-based moir\'e superlattices provide an exceptional platform for exploring competing and coexisting broken symmetry states. Alternating twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) exhibits robust superconductivity at the magic angle of 1.57{\deg} and 1.3{\deg}, with suppression at intermediate twist angles. In this study, we investigate the intermediate regime and uncover evidence of orbital magnetism. As previously reported, superconductivity is suppressed near the charge neutrality point (CNP) and emerges at larger moir\'e fillings. Conversely, we find orbital magnetism most substantial near the CNP, diminishing as superconductivity develops. This complementary behavior is similarly observed in the displacement field phase space, highlighting a competitive interplay between the two phases. Utilizing gate-defined Josephson junctions, we probe orbital magnetism by electrostatically tuning the weak links into the magnetic phase, revealing an asymmetric Fraunhofer interference pattern. The estimated orbital ferromagnetic ordering temperature is approximately half the superconducting critical temperature, coinciding with the onset of Fraunhofer asymmetry. Our findings suggest that the observed orbital magnetism is driven by valley polarization and is distinct from the anomalous Hall effect reported at integer fillings in twisted graphene systems. These results offer insights into the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for room-temperature nanoscale magnets remains a central challenge, driven by their promising applications in quantum technologies. Layered $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal oxides with high magnetic ordering temperatures offer significant potential in this context. We explore ultrathin \ce{SrRu2O6} nanosheets using first-principles calculations, complemented by the classical Heisenberg Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, these nanosheets exhibit robust antiferromagnetic ordering with N\'eel temperatures exceeding 430 K, despite the enhanced spin fluctuations characteristic of two-dimensional systems. Surface-termination-induced intrinsic charge doping introduces complexity to the magnetism, resulting in an insulator-to-metal transition and renormalized N\'eel temperatures in doped systems. A detailed microscopic analysis reveals distinct mechanisms underlying the magnetic behavior in electron- and hole-doped nanosheets. These findings provide a foundation for advancing theoretical and experimental studies in the largely unexplored realm of correlated oxides at the two-dimensional limit.</description>
