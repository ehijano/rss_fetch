      <title>Identifying companies and financial actors exposed to marine tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change and other anthropogenic pressures are likely to induce tipping points in marine ecosystems, potentially leading to declines in primary productivity and fisheries. Despite increasing attention to nature-related financial risks and opportunities within the ocean economy, the extent to which these tipping points could affect investors has remained largely unexplored. Here we used satellite data to track fishing vessels operating in areas prone to marine regime shifts, as identified by their loss of resilience and vulnerability to marine heatwaves, and uncovered their corporate beneficial owners and shareholders. Despite some data gaps, we identified key countries, companies, and shareholders exposed to tipping risk. We also outline the potential challenges and opportunities that these actors may face if marine ecosystems shift to less productive states.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assisted Stacking Sequence Retrieval and Laminated Composite Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We, the QAIMS lab lab at the Aerospace Faculty of TU Delft, participated as finalists in the Airbus/BMW Quantum Computing Challenge 2024. Stacking sequence retrieval, a complex combinatorial task within a bi-level optimization framework, is crucial for designing laminated composites that meet aerospace requirements for weight, strength, and stiffness. This document presents the scientifically relevant sections of our submission, which builds on our prior research on applying quantum computation to this challenging design problem. For the competition, we expanded our previous work in several significant ways. First, we incorporated a full set of manufacturing constraints into our algorithmic framework, including those previously established theoretically but not yet demonstrated, thereby aligning our approach more closely with real-world manufacturing demands. We implemented the F-VQE algorithm, which enhances the probability shaping of optimal solutions, improving on simpler variational quantum algorithms. Our approach also demonstrates flexibility by accommodating diverse objectives as well as finer ply-angle increments alongside the previously demonstrated conventional ply angles. Scalability was tested using the DMRG algorithm, which, despite limitations in entanglement representation, enabled simulations with up to 200 plies. Results were directly compared to conventional stacking sequence retrieval algorithms with DMRG showing high competitiveness. Given DMRG's limited entanglement capabilities, it serves as a conservative baseline, suggesting potential for even greater performance on fully realized quantum systems. This document serves to make our competition results publicly available as we prepare a formal publication on these findings and their implications for aerospace materials design optimization.</description>

      <title>ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving play a critical role in the application of Operations Research (OR) tools to address real-world problems, yet they pose challenges and require extensive expertise from OR experts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to streamline and automate these tasks. However, current research predominantly relies on closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, along with extensive prompt engineering techniques. This reliance stems from the scarcity of high-quality training datasets for optimization modeling, resulting in elevated costs, prolonged processing times, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, our work is the first to propose a viable path for training open-source LLMs that are capable of optimization modeling as well as developing and executing solver codes, eventually leading to a superior ability for automating optimization modeling and solving. Particularly, we introduce a semi-automated data synthesis framework designed for optimization modeling issues, named OR-Instruct. This framework merges the training data requirements of large models with the unique characteristics of optimization modeling problems, and allows for customizable enhancements tailored to specific scenarios or modeling types. To evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we present the IndustryOR benchmark, the inaugural industrial standard for evaluating LLMs in solving practical OR problems. Utilizing data synthesized through OR-Instruct, we train various open-source LLMs with a capacity of 7 billion parameters (dubbed ORLMs). The resulting model demonstrates significantly enhanced optimization modeling capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/ORLM}.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for parameter learning of wildfire spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wildland fires pose a terrifying natural hazard, underscoring the urgent need to develop data-driven and physics-informed digital twins for wildfire prevention, monitoring, intervention, and response. In this direction of research, this work introduces a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) designed to learn the unknown parameters of an interpretable wildfire spreading model. The considered modeling approach integrates fundamental physical laws articulated by key model parameters essential for capturing the complex behavior of wildfires. The proposed machine learning framework leverages the theory of artificial neural networks with the physical constraints governing wildfire dynamics, including the first principles of mass and energy conservation. Training of the PiNN for physics-informed parameter identification is realized using synthetic data on the spatiotemporal evolution of one- and two-dimensional firefronts, derived from a high-fidelity simulator, as well as empirical data (ground surface thermal images) from the Troy Fire that occurred on June 19, 2002, in California. The parameter learning results demonstrate the predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in uncovering the unknown coefficients of the wildfire model in one- and two-dimensional fire spreading scenarios as well as the Troy Fire. Additionally, this methodology exhibits robustness by identifying the same parameters even in the presence of noisy data. By integrating this PiNN approach into a comprehensive framework, the envisioned physics-informed digital twin will enhance intelligent wildfire management and risk assessment, providing a powerful tool for proactive and reactive strategies.</description>
