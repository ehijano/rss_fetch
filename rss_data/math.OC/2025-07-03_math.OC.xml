      <title>A novel exact approach to polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial optimization problems represent a wide class of optimization problems, with a large number of real-world applications. Current approaches for polynomial optimization, such as the sum of squares (SOS) method, rely on large-scale semidefinite programs, and therefore the scale of problems to which they can be applied is limited and an optimality guarantee is not always provided. Moreover, the problem can have other convex nonlinear parts, that cannot be handled by these approaches. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for polynomial optimization. We obtain a convex relaxation of the original polynomial optimization problem, by deriving a sum of linear times convex (SLC) functions decomposition for the polynomial. We prove that such SLC decompositions always exist for arbitrary degree polynomials. Moreover, we derive the SLC decomposition that results in the tightest lower bound, thus improving significantly the quality of the obtained bounds in each node of the spatial Branch and Bound method. In the numerical experiments, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for polynomial optimization, such as BARON and SOS. We show that with our method, we can solve polynomial optimization problems to optimality with 40 variables and degree 3, as well as 20 variables and degree 4, in less than an hour.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Gradient Descent Algorithms are Small-Disturbance Input-to-State Stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the robustness of gradient descent algorithms under perturbations. The concept of small-disturbance input-to-state stability (ISS) for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems is introduced, along with its Lyapunov characterization. The conventional linear Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition is then extended to a nonlinear version, and it is shown that the gradient descent algorithm is small-disturbance ISS provided the objective function satisfies the generalized nonlinear PL condition. This small-disturbance ISS property guarantees that the gradient descent algorithm converges to a small neighborhood of the optimum under sufficiently small perturbations. As a direct application of the developed framework, we demonstrate that the LQR cost satisfies the generalized nonlinear PL condition, thereby establishing that the policy gradient algorithm for LQR is small-disturbance ISS. Additionally, other popular policy gradient algorithms, including natural policy gradient and Gauss-Newton method, are also proven to be small-disturbance ISS.</description>

      <title>Operator-Theoretic Methods for Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential game theory offers an approach for modeling interactions between two or more agents that occur in continuous time. The goal of each agent is to optimize its objective cost functional. In this paper, we present two different methods, based on the Koopman Operator (KO), to solve a zero-sum differential game. The first approach uses the resolvent of the KO to calculate a continuous-time global feedback solution over the entire domain. The second approach uses a discrete-time, data-driven KO representation with control to calculate open-loop control policies one trajectory at a time. We demonstrate these methods on a turret defense game from the literature, and we find that the methods' solutions replicate the behavior of the analytical solution provided in the literature.. Following that demonstration, we highlight the relative advantages and disadvantages of each method and discuss potential future work for this line of research.</description>

Abstract: This article introduces two new fractional operators with sine ($\sin$) and cosine ($\cos$) kernels, motivated by their fundamental role in modeling AC signals in electrical circuits. The operators are designed to improve the analysis of nonlinear components such as the memristor by transforming certain nonlinear equations into simpler linear forms, particularly in systems with memory effects.</description>

      <title>A learning model predictive control for virtual coupling in railroads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to present a novel intelligent train control system for virtual coupling in railroads based on a Learning Model Predictive Control (LMPC). Virtual coupling is an emerging railroad technology that reduces the distance between trains to increase the capacity of the line, whereas LMPC is an optimization-based controller that incorporates artificial intelligence methods to improve its control policies. By incorporating data from past experiences into the optimization problem, LMPC can learn unmodeled dynamics and enhance system performance while satisfying constraints. The LMPC developed in this paper is simulated and compared, in terms of energy consumption, with a general MPC, without learning capabilities. The simulations are divided into two main practical applications: a LMPC applied only to the rear trains (followers) and a LMPC applied to both the followers and the first front train of the convoy (leader). Within each application, the LMPC is independently tested for three railroad categories: metro, regional, and high-speed. The results show that the LMPC reduces energy consumption in all simulation cases while approximately maintaining speed and travel time. The effect is more pronounced in rail applications with frequent speed variations, such as metro systems, compared to high-speed rail. Future research will investigate the impact of using real-world data in place of simulated data.</description>

      <title>Split-Merge Revisited: A Scalable Approach to Generalized Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) serves as a cornerstone in a wide range of applications in numerical linear algebra and scientific computing. However, traditional approaches that aim to maximize the classical Rayleigh quotient often suffer from numerical instability and limited computational efficiency, especially in large-scale settings. In this work, we explore an alternative difference-based formulation of GEP by minimizing a structured quadratic polynomial objective, which enables the application of efficient first-order optimization methods. We establish global convergence guarantees for these methods without requiring line search, and further introduce a transform-domain perspective that reveals the intrinsic connection and performance gap between classical first-order algorithms and the power method. Based on this insight, we develop an accelerated preconditioned mirror descent algorithm, which allows for flexible preconditioner design and improved convergence behavior. Lastly, we extend the recently proposed Split-Merge algorithm to the general GEP setting, incorporating richer second-order information to further accelerate convergence. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant improvements over existing baselines in terms of both computational efficiency and numerical stability.</description>

      <title>Stability characterization of impulsive linear switched systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a class of impulsive systems defined by a mix of continuous-time and discrete-time switched linear dynamics. We first analyze a related class of weighted discrete time switched systems for which we establish two main stability results: a converse Lyapunov theorem and a Berger-Wang-type formula. These results are used to characterize the exponential stability of the considered class of systems via spectral and Lyapunov-based approaches, extending existing results in hybrid and switched systems theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of singularly perturbed impulsive linear switched systems exhibiting switching between slow and fast dynamics. To analyze their behavior, we construct auxiliary switched systems evolving in a single time scale. The stability or instability of these auxiliary systems directly determines that of the original system in the regime of small singular perturbation parameters.</description>

      <title>Maximal entropy in the moment body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A moment body is a linear projection of the spectraplex, the convex set of trace-one positive semidefinite matrices. Determining whether a given point lies within a given moment body is a problem with numerous applications in quantum state estimation or polynomial optimization. This moment body membership oracle can be addressed with semidefinite programming, for which several off-the-shelf interior-point solvers are available. In this paper, inspired by techniques from quantum information theory, we argue analytically and geometrically that a much more efficient approach consists of minimizing globally a smooth strictly convex log-partition function, dual to a maximum entropy problem. We analyze the curvature properties of this function and we describe a neat geometric pre-conditioning algorithm. A detailed complexity analysis reveals a cubic dependence on the matrix size, similar to a few eigenstructure computations. Basic numerical experiments illustrate that dense (i.e. non-sparse) projections of size 1000 of a dense semidefinite matrix of size 1000-by-1000 can be routinely handled in a few seconds on a standard laptop, thereby moving the main bottleneck in large-scale semidefinite programming almost entirely to efficient gradient storage and manipulation.</description>

      <title>HPR-QP: A dual Halpern Peaceman-Rachford method for solving large-scale convex composite quadratic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce HPR-QP, a dual Halpern Peaceman-Rachford (HPR) method designed for solving large-scale convex composite quadratic programming. One distinctive feature of HPR-QP is that, instead of working with the primal formulations, it builds on the novel restricted Wolfe dual introduced in recent years. It also leverages the symmetric Gauss-Seidel technique to simplify subproblem updates without introducing auxiliary slack variables that typically lead to slow convergence. By restricting updates to the range space of the Hessian of the quadratic objective function, HPR-QP employs proximal operators of smaller spectral norms to speed up the convergence. Shadow sequences are elaborately constructed to deal with the range space constraints. Additionally, HPR-QP incorporates adaptive restart and penalty parameter update strategies, derived from the HPR method's $O(1/k)$ convergence in terms of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker residual, to further enhance its performance and robustness. Extensive numerical experiments on benchmark data sets using a GPU demonstrate that our Julia implementation of HPR-QP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in both speed and scalability.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization for Coordinated Long-Term and Short-Term Isolated Microgrid Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-anticipatory long-short-term coordinated dispatch framework for isolated microgrid with hybrid short-long-duration energy storages (LDES). We introduce a convex hull approximation model for nonconvex LDES electrochemical dynamics, facilitating computational tractability and accuracy. To address temporal coupling in SoC dynamics and long-term contracts, we generate hindsight-optimal state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories of LDES and netloads for offline training. In the online stage, we employ kernel regression to dynamically update the SoC reference and propose an adaptive online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm with SoC reference tracking and expert tracking to mitigate myopia and enable adaptive step-size optimization. We rigorously prove that both long-term and short-term policies achieve sublinear regret bounds over time, which improves with more regression scenarios, stronger tracking penalties, and finer convex approximations. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing costs by 73.4%, eliminating load loss via reference tracking, and achieving an additional 2.4% cost saving via the OCO algorithm. These benefits scale up with longer LDES durations, and the method demonstrates resilience to poor forecasts and unexpected system faults.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Perspective on Suboptimal Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work solves suboptimal mixed-integer quadratic programs recursively for feedback control of dynamical systems. The proposed framework leverages parametric mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) and hybrid systems theory to model a recursive MIQP feedback controller and a feedback controlled dynamical system. The proposed hybrid framework theoretically encodes the suboptimal part via solver parameters as bounded perturbations from the optimal solution set. The stability of the proposed hybrid framework is theoretically guaranteed and validated through MIQP model predictive control simulations with multiple solver parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that linearly constrained linear optimization over a Stiefel or Grassmann manifold is NP-hard in general. We show that the same is true for unconstrained quadratic optimization over a Stiefel manifold. We will establish the nonexistence of FPTAS for these optimization problems over a Stiefel manifold. As an aside we extend our results to flag manifolds. Combined with earlier findings, this shows that manifold optimization is a difficult endeavor -- even the simplest problems like LP and unconstrained QP are already NP-hard on the most common manifolds.</description>

      <title>A robust and adaptive MPC formulation for Gaussian process models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and adaptive model predictive control (MPC) framework for uncertain nonlinear systems affected by bounded disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. We use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to learn the uncertain dynamics based on noisy measurements, including those collected during system operation. As a key contribution, we derive robust predictions for GP models using contraction metrics, which are incorporated in the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online learning.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Prescribed-Time Control Framework via Koopman Operator and Adaptive Backstepping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving rapid and time-deterministic stabilization for complex systems characterized by strong nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties presents a significant challenge. Traditional model-based control relies on precise system models, whereas purely data-driven methods often lack formal stability guarantees, limiting their applicability in safety-critical systems. This paper proposes a novel control framework that synergistically integrates data-driven modeling with model-based control. The framework first employs the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (EDMDc) to identify a high-dimensional Koopman linear model and quantify its bounded uncertainty from data. Subsequently, a novel Prescribed-Time Adaptive Backstepping (PTAB) controller is synthesized based on this data-driven model. The design leverages the structural advantages of Koopman linearization to systematically handle model errors and circumvent the "explosion of complexity" issue inherent in traditional backstepping. The proposed controller is validated through simulations on the classic Van der Pol oscillator. The results demonstrate that the controller can precisely stabilize the system states to a small neighborhood of the origin within a user-prescribed time, regardless of the initial conditions, while ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals. This research successfully combines the flexibility of data-driven approaches with the rigor of Lyapunov-based analysis. It provides a high-performance control strategy with quantifiable performance and pre-assignable settling time for nonlinear systems, showcasing its great potential for controlling complex dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a promising technology for solving complex optimization problems that arise in various engineering fields, and therefore has the potential to also significantly impact power electronics applications. This paper offers a concise tutorial on fundamental concepts in quantum computing, serving as both an introduction to the field and a bridge to its potential applications in power electronics. As a first step in this direction, the use of quantum computing for solving offline mixed-integer optimization problems commonly encountered in power electronics is examined. To this end, a simplified power electronics design problem is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and executed on quantum hardware, despite current limitations such as low qubit counts and hardware noise. This demonstration marks a pioneering step towards leveraging quantum methods in power electronics. Moreover, the implications of ongoing advancements in quantum algorithms and hardware are discussed, highlighting their potential to enable the efficient solution of large-scale, multiobjective design and control problems. The presented findings suggest that early adoption and exploration of quantum computing could significantly expand the capabilities and performance of power electronic systems in the near future.</description>

      <title>Moments, Time-Inversion and Source Identification for the Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the initial source identification problem for the heat equation, a notably ill-posed inverse problem characterized by exponential instability. Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Low-rank optimization methods based on projected-projected gradient descent that accumulate at Bouligand stationary points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of minimizing a differentiable function with locally Lipschitz continuous gradient on the algebraic variety of real matrices of upper-bounded rank. This problem is known to enable the formulation of various machine learning or signal processing tasks such as dimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, and signal recovery. Several definitions of stationarity exist for this nonconvex problem. Among them, Bouligand stationarity is the strongest necessary condition for local optimality. This paper proposes two first-order methods that generate a sequence in the variety whose accumulation points are Bouligand stationary. The first method combines the well-known projected-projected gradient descent map with a rank reduction mechanism. The second method is a hybrid of projected gradient descent and projected-projected gradient descent. Both methods stand out in the field of low-rank optimization methods when considering their convergence properties, their streamlined design, their typical computational cost per iteration, and their empirically observed numerical performance. The theoretical framework used to analyze the proposed methods is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An SDP Relaxation for the Sparse Integer Least Squares Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the \emph{sparse integer least squares problem} (SILS), an NP-hard variant of least squares with sparse $\{0, \pm 1\}$-vectors. We propose an $\ell_1$-based SDP relaxation, and a randomized algorithm for SILS, which computes feasible solutions with high probability with an asymptotic approximation ratio $1/T^2$ as long as the sparsity constant $\sigma \ll T$. Our algorithm handles large-scale problems, delivering high-quality approximate solutions for dimensions up to $d = 10,000$. The proposed randomized algorithm applies broadly to binary quadratic programs with a cardinality constraint, even for non-convex objectives. For fixed sparsity, we provide sufficient conditions for our SDP relaxation to solve SILS, meaning that any optimal solution to the SDP relaxation yields an optimal solution to SILS. The class of data input which guarantees that SDP solves SILS is broad enough to cover many cases in real-world applications, such as privacy preserving identification and multiuser detection. We validate these conditions in two application-specific cases: the \emph{feature extraction problem}, where our relaxation solves the problem for sub-Gaussian data with weak covariance conditions, and the \emph{integer sparse recovery problem}, where our relaxation solves the problem in both high and low coherence settings under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Federated Methods for Stochastic MPECs and Nondifferentiable Nonconvex Hierarchical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13024v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of federated learning (FL), we design and analyze federated methods for addressing: (i) Nondifferentiable nonconvex optimization; (ii) Bilevel optimization; (iii) Minimax problems; and (iv) Two-stage stochastic mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (2s-SMPEC). Research on these problems has been limited and afflicted by reliance on strong assumptions, including the need for differentiability of the implicit function and the absence of constraints in the lower-level problem, among others. We make the following contributions. In (i), by leveraging convolution-based smoothing and Clarke's subdifferential calculus, we devise a randomized smoothing-enabled zeroth-order FL method and derive communication and iteration complexity guarantees for computing an approximate Clarke stationary point. To contend with (ii) and (iii), we devise a unifying randomized implicit zeroth-order FL framework, equipped with explicit communication and iteration complexities. Importantly, our method utilizes delays during local steps to skip calls to the inexact lower-level FL oracle. This results in significant reduction in communication overhead. In (iv), we devise an inexact implicit variant of the method in (i). Remarkably, this method achieves a total communication complexity matching that of single-level nonsmooth nonconvex optimization in FL. We empirically validate the theoretical findings on instances of federated nonsmooth and hierarchical problems.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibria for dividend distribution with competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Nash equilibria in feedback form for a class of two-person stochastic games of singular control with absorption, arising from a stylized model for corporate finance. More precisely, the paper focusses on a strategic dynamic game in which two financially-constrained firms operate in the same market. The firms distribute dividends and are faced with default risk. The strategic interaction arises from the fact that if one firm defaults, the other one becomes a monopolist and increases its profitability. The firms choose their dividend distribution policies from a class of randomised strategies and we identify two types of equilibria, depending on the firms' initial endowments. In both situations the optimal strategies and the equilibrium payoffs are found explicitly.</description>

      <title>Fading memory and the convolution theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several topological and analytical notions of continuity and fading memory for causal and time-invariant filters are introduced, and the relations between them are analyzed. A significant generalization of the convolution theorem that establishes the equivalence between the fading memory property and the availability of convolution representations of linear filters is proved. This result extends a previous similar characterization to a complete array of weighted norms in the definition of the fading memory property. Additionally, the main theorem shows that the availability of convolution representations can be characterized, at least when the codomain is finite-dimensional, not only by the fading memory property but also by the reunion of two purely topological notions that are called minimal continuity and minimal fading memory property. Finally, when the input space and the codomain of a linear functional are Hilbert spaces, it is shown that minimal continuity and the minimal fading memory property guarantee the existence of interesting embeddings of the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>A Model-Consistent Data-Driven Computational Strategy for PDE Joint Inversion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of simultaneously reconstructing multiple physical coefficients in partial differential equations (PDEs) from observed data is ubiquitous in applications. In this work, we propose an integrated data-driven and model-based iterative reconstruction framework for such joint inversion problems where additional data on the unknown coefficients are supplemented for better reconstructions. Our method couples the supplementary data with the PDE model to make the data-driven modeling process consistent with the model-based reconstruction procedure. We characterize the impact of learning uncertainty on the joint inversion results for two typical inverse problems. Numerical evidence is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of using data-driven models to improve the joint inversion of multiple coefficients in PDEs.</description>

      <title>Identifying Systems with Symmetries using Equivariant Autoregressive Reservoir Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09511v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The investigation reported in this document focuses on identifying systems with symmetries using equivariant autoregressive reservoir computers. General results in structured matrix approximation theory are presented, exploring a two-fold approach. Firstly, a comprehensive examination of generic symmetry-preserving nonlinear time delay embedding is conducted. This involves analyzing time series data sampled from an equivariant system under study. Secondly, sparse least-squares methods are applied to discern approximate representations of the output coupling matrices. These matrices play a critical role in determining the nonlinear autoregressive representation of an equivariant system. The structural characteristics of these matrices are dictated by the set of symmetries inherent in the system. The document outlines prototypical algorithms derived from the described techniques, offering insight into their practical applications. Emphasis is placed on the significant improvement on structured identification precision when compared to classical reservoir computing methods for the simulation of equivariant dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Affine Gateaux Differentials and the von Mises Statistical Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a general study of one-dimensional differentiability for functionals defined on convex domains that are not necessarily open. The local approximation is carried out using affine functionals, as opposed to linear functionals typically employed in standard Gateaux differentiability. This affine notion of differentiability naturally arises in certain applications and has been utilized by some authors in the statistics literature. We aim to offer a unified and comprehensive perspective on this concept.</description>

      <title>On Mean Field Games in Infinite Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a Mean Field Games (MFG) system in a real, separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space. The system consists of a second order parabolic type equation, called Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the paper, coupled with a nonlinear Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. Both equations contain a Kolmogorov operator. Solutions to the HJB equation are interpreted in the mild solution sense and solutions to the FP equation are interpreted in an appropriate weak sense. We prove well-posedness of the considered MFG system under certain conditions. The existence of a solution to the MFG system is proved using Tikhonov's fixed point theorem in a proper space. Uniqueness of solutions is obtained under typical separability and Lasry-Lions type monotonicity conditions.</description>
