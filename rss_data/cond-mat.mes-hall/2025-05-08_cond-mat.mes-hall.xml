      <title>Transdimensional anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral thin graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), occurring in materials with broken time-reversal symmetry, epitomizes the intricate interplay between magnetic order and orbital motions of electrons[1-4]. In two dimensional (2D) systems, AHE is always coupled with out-of-plane orbital magnetization associated in-plane chiral orbital motions. In three dimensional (3D) systems, carriers can tunnel or scatter along the third dimension within the vertical mean free path lz. When sample thickness far exceeds lz, scattering disrupts coherent out-of-plane motion, making 3D AHE effectively a thickness-averaged 2D counterpart[4] -- still governed by out-of-plane orbital magnetization arising from in-plane orbital motions. Here, we explore an uncharted regime where the sample thickness is much larger than the atomic layer thickness yet smaller than or comparable to lz. In such "transdimensional" regime, carriers can sustain coherent orbital motions both within and out of the 2D plane, leading to a fundamentally new type of AHE that couples both out-of-plane and in-plane orbital magnetizations. We report the first observation of such phenomenon -- transdimensional AHE (TDAHE) -- in electrostatically gated rhombohedral ennealayer graphene. This state emerges from a peculiar metallic phase that spontaneously breaks time-reversal, mirror and rotational symmetries driven by electron-electron interactions. Such TDAHE manifests as concurrent out-of-plane and in-plane Hall resistance hysteresis, controlled by external magnetic fields along either direction. Our findings unveils a new class of AHE, opening an unexplored paradigm for correlated and topological physics in transdimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic evidence of intra-unit-cell charge redistribution in charge-neutral magnetic topological insulator Sb-doped MnBi6Te10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_{6}$Te$_{10}$ has emerged as a promising candidate for realizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), owing to its ability to retain ferromagnetism through precise control of anti-site defects. The next important task for realizing the QAHE is to tune the chemical potential into the energy gap formed by the broken time-reversal symmetry. Here we reveal an intra-unit-cell charge redistribution even when the overall doping suggests a near-charge-neutral condition. By performing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) on the optimally 18% Sb-doped MnBi$_{6}$Te$_{10}$, we observe transient surface photovoltage (SPV) effects on both the MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and single-Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ terminations. Furthermore, we observe a time-dependent splitting of the band structure indicating multiple SPV shifts with different magnitudes. This observation suggests that adjacent plateaus with nominally the same terminating layer exhibit a strong intra-unit-cell charge redistribution, resulting in spontaneous electrical polarization. This is consistent with static micro-ARPES measurements revealing significant doping deviations from the charge-neutral configuration. Our findings underscore the challenges of engineering the family of Mn-Bi-Te materials to realize QAHE purely through chemical doping. Achieving the desired topological quantum phase requires both a uniform carrier doping and a ferromagnetic ground state. Furthermore, the light-induced polarization within each unit cell of ferromagnetic Mn(Bi$_{0.82}$Sb$_{0.18}$)$_{6}$Te$_{10}$ may open new possibilities for optoelectronic and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Low Frequency Noise in CryoCMOS devices through Statistical Single Defect Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices is a critical parameter to keep under control in the design of complex circuits for low temperatures applications. Current models predict the 1/f noise to scale linearly with temperature, and gate oxide defects are expected to freeze out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly observed that 1/f noise deviates from the predicted behaviour and that gate oxide defects are still active around 4.2 K, producing random telegraph noise. In this paper, we probe single gate oxide defects in 2500 nMOS devices down to 5 K in order to investigate the origin of 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices. From our results, it is clear that the number of defects active at cryogenic temperatures resulting in random telegraph noise is larger than at 300 K. Threshold voltage shifts due to charged defects are shown to be exponentially distributed, with different modalities across temperatures and biases: from monomodal at 300 K to trimodal below 100 K. The third mode is interpreted in the framework of percolation theory. By fitting these distributions, it is shown that more than 80% of the detected defects belongs to the oxide bulk. Afterwards, starting from the raw data in time domain, we reconstruct the low frequency noise spectra, highlighting the contributions of defects belonging to different branches and, therefore, to different oxide layers. This analysis shows that, although interface traps and large defects associated with the third mode are the main sources of 1/f noise at 5 K, bulk oxide defects still contribute significantly to low-frequency noise at cryogenic temperatures. Finally, we show that defect time constants and step heights are uncorrelated, proving that elastic tunnelling model for charge trapping is not accurate.</description>

      <title>WKB energy levels in gapped graphene under crossed electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a single layer of graphene subjected to a magnetic field $H$ applied perpendicular to the layer and an in-plane constant radial electric field $E$. The Dirac equation for this configuration does not admit analytical solutions in terms of known special functions. Using the WKB approximation, we demonstrate that for gapped graphene the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition for eigenenergies includes an additional valley-dependent geometrical phase. When this term is accounted for, the WKB approximation exhibits good agreement with results from the exact diagonalization method except to the lowest Landau level.</description>

      <title>Spin-valve effect for spin-polarized surface states in topological semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate magnetoresistance of a single GeTe-Ni junction between the $\alpha$-GeTe topological semimetal and thick nickel film at room and liquid helium temperatures. For the magnetic field parallel to the junction plane, we demonstrate characteristic spin-valve hysteresis with mirrored differential resistance $dV/dI$ peaks even at room temperature. In contrast, for normal magnetic fields spin-valve effect appears only at low temperatures. From the magnetic field anisotropy, observation of the similar effect for another topological semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$, and strictly flat $dV/dI(H)$ magnetoresistance curves for the reference GeTe-Au junction, we connect the observed spin-valve effect with the spin-dependent scattering between the spin textures in the topological surface states and the ferromagnetic nickel electrode. For the topological semimetal $\alpha$-GeTe, room-temperature spin-valve effect allows efficient spin-to-charge conversion even at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Screening of the band gap in electrically biased bilayer graphene: From Hartree to Hartree-Fock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a direct band gap may be opened in bilayer graphene via the application of a perpendicular electric field (bias). The bias and the chemical potential are controlled by electrostatic gating where the top and bottom gate voltages are tuned separately. The value of the band gap opened by the bias field is influenced by the self screening of the bilayer graphene. The Hartree contribution to the self screening is well known in literature, with Hartree screening significantly renormalizing the gap. In the present work we derive the Fock contribution to the self screening and demonstrate that it is equally important and in the low density regime even more important than the Hartree contribution. We calculate the Hartree-Fock screened band gap as a function of electron doping at zero temperature and also as a function of temperature at zero doping.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Mechanical Structures Fabricated from Silicon-on-Insulator Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a method with which to fabricate sub-micron mechanical structures from silicon-on-insulator substrates. We believe this is the first reported method for such fabrication, and our technique allows for complex, multilayer electron beam lithography to define metallized layers and structural Si layers on these substrates. The insulating underlayer may be removed by a straightforward wet processing step, leaving suspended single crystal Si mechanical structures. We have fabricated and mechanically tested structures such as beam resonators, tuning-fork resonators, and torsional oscillators, all with smallest dimensions of 0.1-0.2 microns and fundamental resonance frequencies above 10 MHz.</description>

      <title>Engineering topological exciton structures in two-dimensional semiconductors by a periodic electrostatic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to engineer topological exciton structures in layered transition metal dichalcogenides through hybridizing different Rydberg states, which can be induced by a periodic electrostatic potential remotely imprinted from charge distributions in adjacent layers. Topological phase diagrams are obtained for potentials with various strengths and wavelengths. We find the lowest band of the interlayer exciton can become topologically nontrivial, which exhibits a small bandwidth as well as quantum geometries well suited for realizing the bosonic fractional Chern insulator. For monolayer excitons, topological bands and in-gap helical edge states can emerge near the energy of 2p states.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Noise Magnetometry Using Local Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.</description>

      <title>Geometry dependence of the thermal Hall effect in chiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent thermal-transport experiments on the Kitaev magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ highlight the challenge in identifying chiral quantum spin liquids through their quantized thermal Hall effect. Here, we propose that variations in the underlying sample geometry -- for example, the introduction of appropriate constrictions -- reveal unique aspects of the thermal Hall effect and can be used to determine its origin. By studying standard phenomenological heat-transport equations based on minimal assumptions, we show that, whereas a conventional thermal Hall effect due to, e.g., phonons or magnons is completely geometry independent, a thermal Hall effect originating from a chiral fermion edge mode is significantly enhanced by constrictions at low temperatures. This unique geometry-dependent signature provides a practical approach for identifying chiral spin liquids in candidate materials like $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ using currently available thermal-transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Large critical current density Josephson $\pi$ junctions with PdNi barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report large critical current densities in $\text{Nb} / \text{Pd}_{89}\text{Ni}_{11} / \text{Nb}$ Josephson junctions at thicknesses of $\text{Pd}_{89}\text{Ni}_{11}$ close to where the first $\pi$-state is expected. We observe possible oscillations in the critical current density with the thickness of the $\text{Pd}_{89}\text{Ni}_{11}$ layer that are consistent with a $0-\pi$ transition. From temperature-dependent measurements, we find a large critical current density through our $\text{Pd}_{89}\text{Ni}_{11}$ barriers, exceeding 550 $\text{kA/cm}^2$ at 2 K in zero applied magnetic field, for a barrier thickness of 9.4 nm. From measurements of magnetization on sheet film samples, we confirm that the $\text{Pd}_{89}\text{Ni}_{11}$ layer exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Both the large critical current density and the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are beneficial for proposed applications of $\pi$-junctions in superconducting digital logic and qubits.</description>

      <title>Generic (fractional) quantum anomalous Hall crystals from interaction-driven band folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental realizations of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have been achieved recently, and there is a growing number of experiments in moir\'e systems showing the inequality between the filling of the Chern band and the quantized Hall conductance: $\nu\neq\sigma_\mathrm{H}$. Among many possible explanations, a popular one is that the topological states have coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders, and such states are referred to as Hall crystals. However, apart from the experimental uncertainties, the generic mechanism of Hall crystals, especially those with fractional $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is still elusive at the microscopic level. In this work, we numerically study a topological flat-band model and find that, the Chern band can be folded by the interaction-driven CDW, and a mini Chern band appears above the CDW gap. Through further analysis, we find the energy dispersion and the fluctuation of quantum geometry of the miniband could be flattened by competing interactions. When further doping this miniband, a series of (F)QAH states are found to coexist with the CDW order at (fractional)integer fillings of the miniband and the Hall conductivities of the FQAH crystals (FQAHCs)- determined by the fillings of the miniband - are different from the fillings of the original Chern band. We also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and find the separation of energy scales and a compressible CDW phase at intermediate temperatures. Our work paves the way for the systematic understanding of (fractional) Hall crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological models are characterized by a quantized topological invariant and provide a description of novel phases of matter that can exhibit localized edge states, corner modes, and chiral transport. We experimentally realize two 1-D lattices supporting symmetry-protected topology - the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) and extended SSH models using the synthetic frequency dimension of coupled fiber ring resonators. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate cascaded heterodyning as a technique for low-noise, single-shot winding number measurements through the mean chiral displacement and band structure measurements. Through our robust setup and detection techniques we can extend our capability to realizing 1-D ladder models, demonstrating a modified Creutz ladder with a staggered flux with each plaquette. This highly reconfigurable and compact fiber optics platform for Hamiltonian simulation, along with a low-noise detection scheme, provides a path forward for chip-scale realizations.</description>

      <title>Sign competing sources of Berry curvature and anomalous Hall conductance humps in topological ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Berry-phase concepts has established a strong link between the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the topological character of the Hall currents. However, the occurrence of sign competition in the Berry curvature often hinders the topological origin of the observed anomalous Hall effects. Here, we study a two-dimensional topological ferromagnet with coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom to assess the anomalous Hall effects in the presence of sign-competing sources of Berry curvature. We show that 2D itinerant topological ferromagnets described by t2g electronic states can generally lead to topological metallic bands marked by a non-zero Chern number. We find that the resulting Berry curvature at the Fermi level exhibits a characteristic anisotropic profile with a non-monotonous angular dependence when the magnetization is reversed. The sign change of the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductance can occur together with topological transitions or be driven by the population imbalance of the topological bands. The breaking of the inversion symmetry introduces the orbital Rashba coupling in the system. The interplay between the orbital Rashba and sign competing sources of Berry curvature leads to anomalies in the anomalous Hall conductance at values of magnetic fields for which the magnetization switches its orientation. The humps in topological ferromagnets arise when the anomalous Hall conductivity is small in absolute value and they can be detected only close to the sign-change of the AHE and far from half-filling. This study could be relevant for the family of the topological 2D ferromagnets as well as Weyl ferromagnets, and can particularly account for the variety of unconventional behaviors observed in ultrathin films of SrRuO$_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the charged spinless vortices in the effective field theory of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a gapless neutral scalar field of acoustic phonon. We show that regular static vortex solutions are obtained only for the nonzero critical cubic Yukawa type coupling between neutral and complex scalar fields. Since the Coulombic electric field is exactly cancelled by the phonon, the obtained charged vortices have finite energy. When the quartic self-interaction coupling of complex scalar field has the critical value, the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound is saturated for multiple charged vortices of arbitrary separations and hence the borderline of type I and II superconductors is achieved in nonperturbative regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation of orbital angular momentum has become important to effectuate new ways to address switchable magnetic devices. Here, we demonstrate the electrical generation of unconventional orbital currents in ferro-rotational systems through an intrinsic, nonrelativistic mechanism associated with an electric hexadecapole moment. These rotation-induced orbital currents are examined using tight-binding models, and we also provide first-principles calculations for the ferro-rotational material TiAu$_4$. Our findings unveil a novel pathway for generating orbital currents beyond the conventional orbital Hall effect, broadening the landscape of orbitronics research to include novel ferroic materials and higher-order electric multipoles.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence of intrinsic Mott state and its layer-parity oscillation in a breathing kagome crystal down to monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report direct spectroscopic evidence of correlation-driven Mott states in layered Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ through combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and dynamical mean-field theory. The Hubbard bands persist down to monolayer, providing the definitive evidence for the Mottness in Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. While the size of the Mott gap remains almost constant across all layers, a striking layer-parity-dependent oscillation emerges in the local density of states (LDOS) between even (n = 2,4,6) and odd layers (n = 1,3,5), which arises from the dimerization and correlation modulation of the obstructed atomic states, respectively. Our conclusions are supported by a critical technical advance in atomic-scale LDOS mapping for highly insulating systems. This work provides the definitive experimental verification of correlation-driven Mott ground states in Nb3Cl8 while establishing a general protocol for investigating the interplay of electronic correlation and interlayer coupling in layered insulators by using low-temperature STM technique.</description>

      <title>Ratchet Hall Effect in Fluctuating Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting ratchet-induced Hall effect (RHE), characterized by the emergence of a unidirectional, rectified flux of fluctuating Cooper pairs in a two-dimensional thin film exposed to an external electromagnetic field. The RHE is a second-order response with respect to the electromagnetic field amplitude. It consists of a nonzero photocurrent due to the breaking of the system's inversion symmetry driven by the combined action of the in-plane time-dependent electric field and a spatial modulation of the critical temperature. We explore a means to control the electric current by the polarization of the external field accompanied by a non-linear Hall effect of fluctuating Cooper pairs caused by circularly polarized irradiation. Moreover, the nonlinear conductivity tensor exhibits a higher-power dependence on the reduced temperature compared to that of the conventional Aslamazov-Larkin correction (or other fluctuating second-order nonlinear responses). It results in a dramatic enhancement of the non-linear Hall response of fluctuating Cooper pairs in the vicinity of the superconducting criticality.</description>

      <title>Magnetochiral anisotropy on a quantum spin Hall edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of nonlinear low-magnetic-field magnetotransport on a helical edge of a quantum spin Hall insulator due to the edge state coupling to bulk midgap states. We focus on the part of the nonlinear I-V characteristic that is odd in the applied magnetic field, and quadratic in the applied bias voltage. This part of the I-V characteristic corresponds to the resistance of the sample being dependent on the relative orientation of the current and an external magnetic field, hence represents a type of edge magnetochiral anisotropy. We identify two mechanisms of the magnetochiral anisotropy. One is related to the Hubbard interaction on the midgap state, which leads to the dependence of the scattering characteristics on the current flowing on the edge, which results in bias-voltage-dependent resistance, or equivalently conductance, hence a nonlinear I-V. The other is related to the modification of the edge dispersion by a magnetic field, and requires nonlinearity in the edge dispersion. We compare the developed theory to the experiments on monolayer $\mathrm{WTe}_{2}$, and find good agreement with the developed theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid exciton in moir\'e superlattices of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors inherits the electric dipole, strong moir\'e trapping, and stacking optical selection rules from its interlayer part, whereas the intralayer part is intended for enhancing optical coupling strength. Here, we show that electron-hole Coulomb exchange, or F\"orster coupling, within the intralayer component qualitatively alters the properties of moir\'e excitons, enabling their coherent hopping between moir\'e traps laterally separated over 10 nm and/or across layers, where their kinetic propagation is completely suppressed. Valley-flip hopping channels are found as significant as the valley-conserving ones, leading to rich possibilities to tailor valley-orbit-couplings and introduce non-trivial topology to the moir\'e exciton superlattice. In twisted MoTe$_2$ where hybrid moir\'e excitons feature a symmetry protection from radiative recombination, we show that F\"orster valley-orbit-coupling can give rise to a rich topological phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Large frequency nonreciprocity of azimuthal spin wave modes in submicron vortex state disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex states in thin film disks host spin-wave modes that are geometrically quantized according to their radial and azimuthal indices. Previous studies have shown that hybridization between these modes and the vortex core results in a sizable frequency nonreciprocity between low-order clockwise and counterclockwise propagating azimuthal modes. Here, we present a computational study of these spin-wave modes in submicron disks in which the spatial extension of the vortex core becomes comparable to the wavelength of certain modes. In such cases, we find that the frequency nonreciprocity can be large even for higher order radial and azimuthal indices, reaching several GHz and comparable to the mode frequencies themselves.</description>

Abstract: We report the observation of Dirac-Landau polaritons via THz magnetoreflectivity spectroscopy, demonstrating strong coupling between cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells and optical cavity modes. We demonstrate efficient nonlinear electroluminescence, characterized by a strongly out-of-equilibrium polariton distribution dominated by emission from the upper polariton branches. Model calculations, based on the nonlinear dependence of the emission intensity and spectral narrowing with bias voltage, indicate a polariton occupancy per mode close to unity, with a significant contribution from stimulated polariton emission. These findings open promising prospects for the development of Dirac-Landau polariton condensates and low-threshold, tunable terahertz polariton lasers based on cyclotron emission.</description>

Abstract: We present an in-depth study of electronic transport in atomic-sized gold contacts using Break-Junction (BJ) techniques under cryogenic and ambient conditions. Our experimental results, supported by classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations and ab initio calculations, provide compelling evidence for the formation of three-atom-thick structures in gold nanocontacts under tensile stress. These findings extend previous studies that confirmed the existence of one- and two-atom-thick chains. Beyond identifying these novel atomic configurations, we introduce a fast and robust calibration method for Break-Junction systems, leveraging the characteristic length of these structures to convert piezo displacement into absolute distance in angstroms. Our approach presents a novel and robust method for calibrating atomic distances in atomic conductor systems at both cryogenic and room temperatures. The results also enable the assessment of electrode sharpness, even at room conditions.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Capacitance of Rydberg Transitions of Surface Electrons on Liquid Helium via Microwave Frequency Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry. Resonant microwave excitation of the Rydberg transition induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance originating from adiabatic state transitions and the finite curvature of the energy bands. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.34~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ for our RF reflectometry scheme. This sensitivity is sufficient to detect the Rydberg transition of a single electron, offering a scalable pathway toward qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical model for power transfer in a magnetoelectric film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) comprising a piezoelectric-magnetostrictive bilayer. The model describes the power flow between the elastic and magnetic systems, quantifying the transduction efficiency when the FBAR operates as a magnetic transducer. By applying the model to example systems using piezoelectric ScAlN and magnetostrictive CoFeB, Ni, or Terfenol-D layers, we demonstrate the potential for achieving high efficiencies in magnetoelectric transducers, rendering them ideal for efficient ferromagnetic resonance excitation. The validity of the model's assumptions is confirmed through comparison with a numerical finite element resonator model in COMSOL\texttrademark. The finite element model further enables a comprehensive study of the resonator's dynamic behavior, including transient and steady-state regimes, and the identification of resonant frequencies within the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doping nonmagnetic semiconductors with magnetic impurities is a feasible way to obtain diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). It is generally accepted that for the most extensively studied DMS, (Ga, Mn)As, its highest Curie temperature T$_{\text{C}}$ was achieved at 200 K with a Mn concentration of approximately 16\% in experiments. A recent experiment reported record-breaking high electron and hole mobilities in the semiconductor BAs [\href{https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn4290}{Science 377, 437 (2022)}]. Since BAs shares the same zinc-blende structure with GaAs, here we predict four DMSs (B, Mn)X (X $=$ N, P, As, Sb) by density functional theory calculations. Using a rescaling method to diminish the overestimation of Curie temperature, our results indicate that a significantly higher T$_{\text{C}}$ in the range of 467 K to 485 K for (B, Mn)As with a Mn concentration of around 15.6\% and even higher T$_{\text{C}}$ values above the room temperature for (B, Mn)P with a Mn concentration exceeding 9.4\%. Furthermore, using the method of Ab initio Scattering and Transport (AMSET) with first-principles material parameters, we have predicted a hole mobility of 48.9 cm$^{\text{2}}$V$^{\text{-1}}$s$^{\text{-1}}$ at 300 K for (B, Mn)As with the hole concentration of about n$_{\text{h}}$ $=$ 4.2 $\times$ 10$^{\text{19}}$ cm$^{\text{-3}}$, which is about two times larger than the hole mobility at 300 K in the calculations for (Ga, Mn)As. The hole mobility of (B, Mn)As can be enhanced faster than that of (Ga, Mn)As when the hole concentration is decreased. Our findings predict the emergence of a new family of DMS, (B, Mn)X, and are expected to stimulate both experimental and theoretical studies of the DMS with possible high T$_{\text{C}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-state transitions of a single Cu-phthalocyanine molecule adsorbed on an insulating layer of NaCl on Cu(111) are probed by means of alternate charging scanning tunneling microscopy. Real-space imaging of the electronic transitions reveals the Jahn-Teller distortion occurring upon formation of the first and second anionic charge states. The experimental findings are rationalized by a theoretical many-body model which highlights the crucial role played by the substrate. The latter enhances and stabilizes the intrinsic Jahn-Teller distortion of the negatively charged molecule hosting a degenerate pair of single-particle frontier orbitals. Consequently, two excess electrons are found to occupy, in the ground state, the same localized orbital, despite a larger Coulomb repulsion than the one for the competing delocalized electronic configuration. Control over the charging sequence by varying the applied bias voltage is also predicted.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort Carbon Nanotubes with Luminescent Color Centers are Bright NIR-II Nano-Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the fields of bioimaging, photonics, and quantum science, it is equally crucial to combine high brightness with nanoscale size in short-wave infrared (SWIR) emitters. However, such nano-emitters are currently lacking. Here, we report that when functionalized with luminescent color centers, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with length much shorter than 100 nm, are surprisingly bright in the near-infrared second-biological window (NIR-II) of the SWIR domain. We discuss the origin of this exceptional brightness based on the uncontrollable presence of quenching defects in dispersed carbon nanotubes. We further investigate the nonlinear photoluminescence behavior of color centers functionalized carbon nanotubes in response to varying excitation conditions, spanning from ensemble measurements to single-nanotube experiments. We discuss how this behavior influences the determination of their photoluminescence quantum yields, which can reach values as high as 20% for ultrashort ones detected at the single nanotube level. Notably, the corresponding NIR-II brightness exceeds that of well-known visible emitters, including quantum dots. After rendering them biocompatible, we demonstrate point-spread function engineering and high-resolution, 3-dimensional single-particle tracking using these bright ultrashort carbon nanotubes allowing nanoscale imaging in the NIR-II window within thick brain tissue.</description>

Abstract: A field theory of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of gapless acoustic phonon is proposed for superconductivity of s-waves. Presence of the gapless neutral scalar field is justified as low energy residual acoustic phonon degrees in the context of effective field theory. The critical coupling of quartic self-interaction of complex scalar field is computed from a 1-loop level interaction balance between the repulsion mediated by massive degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by massive Higgs degree, in the static limit. The obtained net attraction or repulsion in perturbative regime matches the type I or II superconductivity, respectively. We find the new critical coupling of cubic Yukawa type interaction between the neutral and complex scalar fields from another tree level interaction balance between the Coulomb repulsion mediated by massless degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by the gapless neutral scalar field, in the static limit. Superconducting phase is realized at or in the vicinity of this critical coupling. A huge discrepancy between the propagation speeds of photon and phonon gives a plausible explanation on low critical temperatures in conventional superconductors.</description>
