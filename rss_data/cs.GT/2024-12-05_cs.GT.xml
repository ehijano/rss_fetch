      <title>Combinatorial Pen Testing (or Consumer Surplus of Deferred-Acceptance Auctions)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pen testing is the problem of selecting high-capacity resources when the only way to measure the capacity of a resource expends its capacity. We have a set of $n$ pens with unknown amounts of ink and our goal is to select a feasible subset of pens maximizing the total ink in them. We are allowed to learn about the ink levels by writing with them, but this uses up ink that was previously in the pens.
  We identify optimal and near optimal pen testing algorithms by drawing analogues to auction theoretic frameworks of deferred-acceptance auctions and virtual values. Our framework allows the conversion of any near optimal deferred-acceptance mechanism into a near optimal pen testing algorithm. Moreover, these algorithms guarantee an additional overhead of at most $(1+o(1)) \ln n$ in the approximation factor to the omniscient algorithm that has access to the ink levels in the pens. We use this framework to give pen testing algorithms for various combinatorial constraints like matroid, knapsack, and general downward-closed constraints, and also for online environments.</description>

      <title>Reducing Optimism Bias in Incomplete Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01930v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative game theory has diverse applications in contemporary artificial intelligence, including domains like interpretable machine learning, resource allocation, and collaborative decision-making. However, specifying a cooperative game entails assigning values to exponentially many coalitions, and obtaining even a single value can be resource-intensive in practice. Yet simply leaving certain coalition values undisclosed introduces ambiguity regarding individual contributions to the collective grand coalition. This ambiguity often leads to players holding overly optimistic expectations, stemming from either inherent biases or strategic considerations, frequently resulting in collective claims exceeding the actual grand coalition value. In this paper, we present a framework aimed at optimizing the sequence for revealing coalition values, with the overarching goal of efficiently closing the gap between players' expectations and achievable outcomes in cooperative games. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we study the individual players' optimistic completions of games with missing coalition values along with the arising gap, and investigate its analytical characteristics that facilitate more efficient optimization; (ii) we develop methods to minimize this gap over classes of games with a known prior by disclosing values of additional coalitions in both offline and online fashion; and (iii) we empirically demonstrate the algorithms' performance in practical scenarios, together with an investigation into the typical order of revealing coalition values.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Games with Scaling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take the classic facility location problem and consider a variation, in which each agent's individual cost function is equal to their distance from the facility multiplied by a scaling factor which is determined by the facility placement. In addition to the general class of continuous scaling functions, we also provide results for piecewise linear scaling functions which can effectively approximate or model the scaling of many real world scenarios. We focus on the objectives of total and maximum cost, describing the computation of the optimal solution. We then move to the approximate mechanism design setting, observing that the agents' preferences may no longer be single-peaked. Consequently, we characterize the conditions on scaling functions which ensure that agents have single-peaked preferences. Under these conditions, we find a characterization of continuous, strategyproof, and anonymous mechanisms, and compute the total and maximum cost approximation ratios achievable by these mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Designing High-Occupancy Toll Lanes: A Game-Theoretic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the optimal design of High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes. The traffic authority determines the road capacity allocation between HOT lanes and ordinary lanes, as well as the toll price charged for travelers using HOT lanes who do not meet the high-occupancy eligibility criteria. We develop a game-theoretic model to analyze the decisions of travelers with heterogeneous preference parameters in values of time and carpool disutilities. These travelers choose between paying or forming carpools to use the HOT lanes, or taking the ordinary lanes. Travelers' welfare depends on the congestion cost of the lane they use, the toll payment, and the carpool disutilities. For highways with a single entrance and exit node, we provide a complete characterization of equilibrium strategies and a comparative statics analysis of how the equilibrium vehicle flow and travel time change with HOT capacity and toll price. We then extend the single segment model to highways with multiple entrance and exit nodes. We extend the equilibrium concept and propose various design objectives considering traffic congestion, toll revenue, and social welfare. Using the data collected from the HOT lane of the California Interstate Highway 880 (I-880), we formulate a convex program to estimate the travel demand and approximate the distribution of travelers' preference parameters. We then compute the optimal toll design of five segments for I-880 for achieve each one of the four objectives, and compare the optimal solution with the current toll pricing.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Finite Space Mean-Field Type Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean field type games (MFTGs) describe Nash equilibria between large coalitions: each coalition consists of a continuum of cooperative agents who maximize the average reward of their coalition while interacting non-cooperatively with a finite number of other coalitions. Although the theory has been extensively developed, we are still lacking efficient and scalable computational methods. Here, we develop reinforcement learning methods for such games in a finite space setting with general dynamics and reward functions. We start by proving that MFTG solution yields approximate Nash equilibria in finite-size coalition games. We then propose two algorithms. The first is based on quantization of mean-field spaces and Nash Q-learning. We provide convergence and stability analysis. We then propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which can scale to larger spaces. Numerical experiments in 5 environments with mean-field distributions of dimension up to $200$ show the scalability and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>
