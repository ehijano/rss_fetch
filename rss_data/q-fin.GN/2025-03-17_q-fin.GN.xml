      <title>Vote Delegation in DeFi Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the drivers of vote delegation in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), using the Uniswap governance DAO as a laboratory. We show that parties with fewer self-owned votes and those affiliated with the controlling venture capital firm, Andreesen Horowitz (a16z), receive more vote delegations. These patterns suggest that while the Uniswap ecosystem values decentralization, a16z may engage in window-dressing around it. Moreover, we find that an active and successful track record in submitting improvement proposals, especially in the final stage, leads to more vote delegations, indicating that delegation in DAOs is at least partly reputation- or merit-based. Combined, our findings provide new insights into how governance and decentralization operate in DeFi.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Unexplainable: A Systematic Review of Explainable AI in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05966</link>

Abstract: Practitioners and researchers trying to strike a balance between accuracy and transparency center Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) at the junction of finance. This paper offers a thorough overview of the changing scene of XAI applications in finance together with domain-specific implementations, methodological developments, and trend mapping of research. Using bibliometric and content analysis, we find topic clusters, significant research, and most often used explainability strategies used in financial industries. Our results show a substantial dependence on post-hoc interpretability techniques; attention mechanisms, feature importance analysis and SHAP are the most often used techniques among them. This review stresses the need of multidisciplinary approaches combining financial knowledge with improved explainability paradigms and exposes important shortcomings in present XAI systems.</description>

      <title>Large language models in finance : what is financial sentiment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial sentiment has become a crucial yet complex concept in finance, increasingly used in market forecasting and investment strategies. Despite its growing importance, there remains a need to define and understand what financial sentiment truly represents and how it can be effectively measured. We explore the nature of financial sentiment and investigate how large language models (LLMs) contribute to its estimation. We trace the evolution of sentiment measurement in finance, from market-based and lexicon-based methods to advanced natural language processing techniques. The emergence of LLMs has significantly enhanced sentiment analysis, providing deeper contextual understanding and greater accuracy in extracting sentiment from financial text. We examine how BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA, excel in financial text generation and real-time sentiment interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive transformer architectures highlights their respective roles in investor sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial decision-making. By exploring what financial sentiment is and how it is estimated within LLMs, we provide insights into the growing role of AI-driven sentiment analysis in finance.</description>
