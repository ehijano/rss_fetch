      <title>Ion Charge States from a Global Time-Dependent Wave-Turbulence-Driven Model of the Solar Wind: Comparison with in-situ Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar wind charge-state measurements contain a wealth of knowledge related to the properties of the solar corona from where they originated. However, their interpretation has remained challenging because it convolves coronal temperature, density, and velocity along the particles' trajectory through the corona before they ``freeze in'' and are convected outward through the solar wind. In this study, we calculate ion charge states by coupling a non-equilibrium ionization model with a global magnetohydrodynamic model of the corona and inner heliosphere. We present results for two periods characteristic of solar minimum and maximum and compare them with observations from the ACE spacecraft. We find that the model reproduces the essential features of the observations, rectifying an earlier inconsistency that was apparent in 1-D calculations, and allows us to unambiguously trace the evolution of charge states from the base of the corona into the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Solar wind entry into Mercury's magnetosphere: Simulation results for the second swingby of BepiColombo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We use a global 3D hybrid plasma model to investigate the interaction between Mercury's magnetosphere and the solar wind for the second BepiColombo swingby, evaluate magnetospheric regions, and study the typical energy profile of protons. Aims. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of solar wind entry and analyze simulated plasma data along a trajectory using BepiColombo swingby 2 conditions, with the goal of enhancing our comprehension of measurement data and potentially providing forecasts for future swingbys. Methods. To model Mercury's plasma environment, we used the hybrid code AIKEF and developed a method to extract the particle (ion) data in order to compute the proton energy spectrum along the trajectory of BepiColombo during its second Mercury swingby on June 23, 2022. We evaluate magnetopause and bow shock stand-off distances under average upstream solar wind conditions with the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) condition derived from the BepiColombo magnetic field measurements during the second Mercury swingby. Results. We found that the magnetosheath on the quasi-perpendicular (dusk) side of the bow shock is thicker than that on the quasi-parallel (dawn) side, where a foreshock is formed. Multiple plasma populations can be extracted from our modeled energy spectra that assist in identifying magnetospheric regions. We observed protons of solar wind origin entering Mercury's magnetosphere. Their energies range from a few electron volts in the magnetosphere up to 10 keV in the magnetosheath.</description>
