      <title>Evaluation Microscopic Origins in Nonlinear Optical Crystals: Based on Rigorous Atomic Space Tessellating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clarifying the contribution of various atoms and structural units formed in nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal materials to macroscopic optical response is crucial for NLO crystal design. In this work, the rigorous atomic space tessellating (AST) method without any empirical parameters is introduced to evaluate the correlated contributions in wavelength dependent optical responses. The NLO crystal CsSbF2SO4 with significant asymmetric electron distribution of Sb3+ was selected as the case study. This study indicates that there are significant differences in atomic and dipole moment contributions between static and dynamic second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility. Using only the information obtained from NLO-active unit analysis of static SHG susceptibilities to explain the NLO phenomenon in actual photoexcitation can even lead to qualitative errors. Among all the transitions in SHG effects, the on-site transition of Sb has the largest component, while the O-Sb off-site transition with multiple transition channels contributes the most to the macroscopic SHG susceptibilities. The relevant methods have also been extended to linear optics and used to study first-order susceptibilities anisotropy, which is important for achieving phase matching. Sb3+ contributes significantly to the linear optical anisotropy with the same sign as SO42-.</description>

      <title>Optimal Position Detection of an Optically Levitated Mie Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the problem of position detection of an optically levitated Mie particle. The information radiation field (IRF) is proposed and defined to characterize the scattered light carrying complete information about the center-of-mass (c.m.) motion of the particle. Based on the IRF, we suggest an optimal detection scheme for the position of arbitrary particles. We calculate both the information losses of objective collection and mode-matching in levitated optomechanical experiments. Our results conclude that the backward detection scheme, using an incident Gaussian beam focused by a high numerical aperture lens, provides sufficient information to achieve the quantum ground state through cooling of the three-dimensional c.m. motion of the Mie particle.</description>

      <title>Digital cytometry: extraction of forward and side scattering signals from holotomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow cytometry is a cornerstone technique in medical and biological research, providing crucial information about cell size and granularity through forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) signals. Despite its widespread use, the precise relationship between these scatter signals and corresponding microscopic images remains underexplored. Here, we investigate this intrinsic relationship by utilizing scattering theory and holotomography, a three-dimensional quantitative phase imaging (QPI) technique. We demonstrate the extraction of FSC and SSC signals from individual, unlabeled cells by analyzing their three-dimensional refractive index distributions obtained through holotomography. Additionally, we introduce a method for digitally windowing SSC signals to facilitate effective segmentation and morphology-based cell type classification. Our approach bridges the gap between flow cytometry and microscopic imaging, offering a new perspective on analyzing cellular characteristics with high accuracy and without the need for labeling.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Radiative Heat Transfer Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that is having a huge impact in the different conventional disciplines, including physical sciences. Here, we show how reinforcement learning methods can be applied to solve optimization problems in the context of radiative heat transfer. We illustrate their use with the optimization of the near-field radiative heat transfer between multilayer hyperbolic metamaterials. Specifically, we show how this problem can be formulated in the language of reinforcement learning and tackled with a variety of algorithms. We show that these algorithms allow us to find solutions that outperform those obtained using physical intuition. Overall, our work shows the power and potential of reinforcement learning methods for the investigation of a wide variety of problems in the context of radiative heat transfer and related topics.</description>

      <title>Narrow Linewidth Distributed Feedback Lasers Utilizing Distributed Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes and experimentally demonstrates a distributed feedback (DFB) laser with a distributed phase shift (DPS) region at the center of the DFB cavity. By modeling the field intensity distribution in the cavity and the output spectrum, the DPS region length and phase shift values have been optimized. Experimental comparisons with lasers using traditional {\pi}-phase shifts confirm that DFB lasers with optimized DPS lengths and larger phase shifts (up to 15{\pi}) achieve stable single longitudinal mode operation over a broader current range, with lower threshold current, higher power slope efficiency, and a higher side mode suppression ratio (SMSR). Furthermore, the minimum optical linewidth is reduced significantly, from 1.3 MHz to 220 kHz.</description>

      <title>Design of a release-free piezo-optomechanical quantum transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons could combine the long-range connectivity provided by optical photons with the deterministic quantum operations of superconducting microwave qubits. A promising approach to quantum microwave-optics transduction uses an intermediary mechanical mode along with piezo-optomechanical interactions. So far, such transducers have been released from their underlying substrate to confine mechanical fields -- preventing proper thermal anchoring and creating a noise-efficiency trade-off resulting from optical absorption. Here, we introduce a release-free, i.e. non-suspended, piezo-optomechanical transducer intended to circumvent this noise-efficiency trade-off. We propose and design a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) release-free transducer with appealing piezo- and optomechanical performance. Our proposal integrates release-free lithium niobate electromechanical crystals with silicon optomechanical crystals on a sapphire substrate meant to improve thermal anchoring along with microwave and mechanical coherence. It leverages high-wavevector mechanical modes firmly guided on the chip surface. Beyond quantum science and engineering, the proposed platform and design principles are attractive for low-power acousto-optic systems in integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast symmetry control in photoexcited quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry control is essential for realizing unconventional properties, such as ferroelectricity, nonlinear optical responses, and complex topological order, thus it holds promise for the design of emerging quantum and photonic systems. Nevertheless, fast and reversible control of symmetry in materials remains a challenge, especially for nanoscale systems. Here, we unveil reversible symmetry changes in colloidal lead chalcogenide quantum dots on picosecond timescales. Using a combination of ultrafast electron diffraction and total X-ray scattering, in conjunction with atomic-scale structural modeling and first-principles calculations, we reveal that symmetry-broken lead sulfide quantum dots restore to a centrosymmetric phase upon photoexcitation. The symmetry restoration is driven by photoexcited electronic carriers, which suppress lead off-centering for about 100 ps. Furthermore, the change in symmetry is closely correlated with the electronic properties as shown by transient optical measurements. Overall, this study elucidates reversible symmetry changes in colloidal quantum dots, and more broadly defines a new methodology to optically control symmetry in nanoscale systems on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent exotic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15691v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.</description>

      <title>Brownian Colloids in Optothermal Field: An Experimental Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal matter undergoing Brownian motion serves as a model system to study various physical phenomena. Understanding the effect of external perturbation on the assembly and dynamics of Brownian colloids has emerged as a relevant research issue in soft matter and biological physics. Optical perturbation in the form of photonic forces and torques has added impetus to this exploration. In recent years, optothermal effects arising due to optical excitation of mesoscale matter have expanded the toolbox of light-colloidal matter interactions. In this perspective, we present an experimental viewpoint on some of the developments related to the assembly and dynamics of Brownian colloids driven by the optothermal field. Furthermore, we discuss some interesting prospects on driven colloidal matter that can have implications on soft matter physics and soft photonics.</description>

      <title>Emission dynamics and spectrum of a nanoshell-based plasmonic nanolaser spaser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically the emission and lasing properties of a single nanoshell spaser nanoparticle, or plasmonic nanolaser, made of an active core (gain material) and a plasmonic metal shell. Based on an analytical framework coupling together time-dependent equations for the gain and the metal, we calculate the lasing threshold with the help of an instability analysis. We characterize the regime under the threshold, where the nanoshell behaves as an optical amplifier when excited by an incident probe field. We then investigate in depth the non-linear lasing regime above the threshold, under autonomous conditions (free lasing without external drive), by computing the system's dynamics both in the transient state and in the final steady state. We show that at threshold, the lasing starts at one frequency only, usually one of the plasmon resonances of the nanoshell; then as the gain is further raised, the emission widens to other frequencies. This differs significantly from previous findings in the literature, which found only one emission wavelength above threshold. We proceed to calculate the complete (maximal) emission spectrum of the nanolaser as well as its emission linewidth, both of which are evidenced to be affected by unusually strong frequency shifts (pull-out) effects. We find that the nanolaser emission is highly asymmetrical spectrally and only occurs on one side (high-frequency) of the plasmon resonance. Finally, we show that the spectral position of the emission line can be tuned across the whole visible range, by changing the geometrical aspect ratio of the nanoshell.</description>

      <title>Resonant wavelengths of whispering gallery modes in dispersive materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we compute the resonant wavelength of whispering gallery modes for bulk-fused silica microspheres including chromatic dispersion. This is done following two methods: by solving the exact characteristic equation and, on the other hand, by solving the nonlinear equations that result for a variable refractive index in the asymptotic approximations. Similar results with both methods are obtained with differences below $1\%$ . Nevertheless, important differences are found with respect to the resonant wavelengths computed with a constant index and with a variable index. We compute the free spectral range and the quality factor, and make a comparison between the variable index and the constant index cases. The differences are of significant relevance for the free spectral range, while for the quality factor, the constant case is insensitive to the chromatic dispersion. Our work could be useful as a pathway for designing microspheres for different applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral engineering of TeraHertz (THz) light fields and the use of the handedness of light in THz light-matter interactions promise many novel opportunities for advanced sensing and control of matter in this frequency range. Unlike previously explored methods, this is achieved here by leveraging the chiral properties of highly confined THz surface plasmon modes. More specifically, we design ultrasmall surface plasmonic-based THz cavities and THz metasurfaces that display significant and adjustable chiral behavior under modest magnetic fields (B&lt;500mT). For such a prototypical example of non-hermitian and dispersive photonic system, we demonstrate the capacity to magnetic field-tune both the poles and zeros of cavity resonances, the two fundamental parameters governing their resonance properties. Alongside the observed handedness-dependent cavity frequencies, this highlights the remarkable ability to engineer chiral and tunable radiative couplings for THz resonators and metasurfaces. The extensive tunability offered by the surface plasmonic approach paves the way for the development of agile and multifunctional THz metasurfaces as well as the realization of ultrastrong chiral light-matter interactions at low energy in matter with potential far-reaching applications for the design of material properties.</description>

      <title>All-fiber microendoscopic polarization sensing at single-photon level aided by deep-learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarization of light conveys crucial information about the spatial ordering and optical properties of a specimen. However, precise polarization measurement in challenging conditions, including constrained spaces, low light levels, and high-speed scenarios, remains a severe challenge. Addressing this problem, we introduce a real-time polarization measurement method accurate down to a single-photon level that provides complete information about the polarization state. Free of moving components, the polarization sensor utilizes a few-mode fiber followed by a fiber array and a detector array. The calibration of the sensor relies on a neural network yielding unprecedented accuracy across all polarization states, including partially polarized light. We validate the approach by visualizing the polarization structure of a biological specimen. Our method offers an efficient and reliable solution for real-time polarization sensing and microendoscopy under low-light conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Quantum Optics at a Topological Interface Enabled by Defect Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of topology into photonics has generated a new design framework for constructing robust and unidirectional waveguides, which are not feasible with traditional photonic devices. Here, we overcome current barriers to the successful integration of quantum emitters such as quantum dots (QDs) into valley-Hall (VH) topological waveguides, utilising photonic defects at the topological interface to stabilise the local charge environment and inverse design for efficient topological-conventional mode conversion. By incorporating QDs within defects of VH-photonic crystals, we demonstrate the first instances of single-photon resonant fluorescence and resonant transmission spectroscopy of a quantum emitter at a topological waveguide interface. Our results bring together topological photonics with optical nonlinear effects at the single-photon level, offering a new avenue to investigate the interaction between topology and quantum nonlinear systems.</description>
