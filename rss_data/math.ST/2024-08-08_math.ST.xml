      <title>An Upper Confidence Bound Approach to Estimating the Maximum Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the maximum mean finds a variety of applications in practice. In this paper, we study estimation of the maximum mean using an upper confidence bound (UCB) approach where the sampling budget is adaptively allocated to one of the systems. We study in depth the existing grand average (GA) estimator, and propose a new largest-size average (LSA) estimator. Specifically, we establish statistical guarantees, including strong consistency, asymptotic mean squared errors, and central limit theorems (CLTs) for both estimators, which are new to the literature. We show that LSA is preferable over GA, as the bias of the former decays at a rate much faster than that of the latter when sample size increases. By using the CLTs, we further construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the maximum mean, and propose a single hypothesis test for a multiple comparison problem with application to clinical trials. Statistical efficiency of the resulting point and interval estimates and the proposed single hypothesis test is demonstrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Advances in Bayesian model selection consistency for high-dimensional generalized linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering genuine relationships between a response variable of interest and a large collection of covariates is a fundamental and practically important problem. In the context of Gaussian linear models, both the Bayesian and non-Bayesian literature is well-developed and there are no substantial differences in the model selection consistency results available from the two schools. For the more challenging generalized linear models (GLMs), however, Bayesian model selection consistency results are lacking in several ways. In this paper, we construct a Bayesian posterior distribution using an appropriate data-dependent prior and develop its asymptotic concentration properties using new theoretical techniques. In particular, we leverage Spokoiny's powerful non-asymptotic theory to obtain sharp quadratic approximations of the GLM's log-likelihood function, which leads to tight bounds on the errors associated with the model-specific maximum likelihood estimators and the Laplace approximation of our Bayesian marginal likelihood. In turn, these improved bounds lead to significantly stronger, near-optimal Bayesian model selection consistency results, e.g., far weaker beta-min conditions, compared to those available in the existing literature. In particular, our results are applicable to the Poisson regression model, in which the score function is not sub-Gaussian.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian priors are investigated for detecting targets of known spectral signature (but unknown strength) in cluttered backgrounds. A specific problem is the construction (or ``sculpting'') of a Bayesian prior that uniformly outperforms its non-Bayesian counterpart, the nominally sub-optimal but widely used Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT).</description>

      <title>Inference with the Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm in the context of multiarmed bandit problems and discuss its implication in downstream inferential tasks. While inferential tasks become challenging when data is collected in a sequential manner, we argue that this problem can be alleviated when the sequential algorithm at hand satisfies certain stability property. This notion of stability is motivated from the seminal work of Lai and Wei (1982). Our first main result shows that such a stability property is always satisfied for the UCB algorithm, and as a result the sample means for each arm are asymptotically normal. Next, we examine the stability properties of the UCB algorithm when the number of arms $K$ is allowed to grow with the number of arm pulls $T$. We show that in such a case the arms are stable when $\frac{\log K}{\log T} \rightarrow 0$, and the number of near-optimal arms are large.</description>

      <title>Graph Matching via convex relaxation to the simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Graph Matching problem, which consists of finding the best possible alignment between two input graphs, and has many applications in computer vision, network deanonymization and protein alignment. A common approach to tackle this problem is through convex relaxations of the NP-hard \emph{Quadratic Assignment Problem} (QAP).
  Here, we introduce a new convex relaxation onto the unit simplex and develop an efficient mirror descent scheme with closed-form iterations for solving this problem. Under the correlated Gaussian Wigner model, we show that the simplex relaxation admits a unique solution with high probability. In the noiseless case, this is shown to imply exact recovery of the ground truth permutation. Additionally, we establish a novel sufficiency condition for the input matrix in standard greedy rounding methods, which is less restrictive than the commonly used `diagonal dominance' condition. We use this condition to show exact one-step recovery of the ground truth (holding almost surely) via the mirror descent scheme, in the noiseless setting. We also use this condition to obtain significantly improved conditions for the GRAMPA algorithm [Fan et al. 2019] in the noiseless setting.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference and A/B Testing in Fisher Markets and Paced Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of statistical inference and A/B testing for two market equilibrium models: linear Fisher market (LFM) equilibrium and first-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE). LFM arises from fair resource allocation systems such as allocation of food to food banks and notification opportunities to different types of notifications. For LFM, we assume that the data observed is captured by the classical finite-dimensional Fisher market equilibrium, and its steady-state behavior is modeled by a continuous limit Fisher market. The second type of equilibrium we study, FPPE, arises from internet advertising where advertisers are constrained by budgets and advertising opportunities are sold via first-price auctions. For platforms that use pacing-based methods to smooth out the spending of advertisers, FPPE provides a hindsight-optimal configuration of the pacing method. We propose a statistical framework for the FPPE model, in which a continuous limit FPPE models the steady-state behavior of the auction platform, and a finite FPPE provides the data to estimate primitives of the limit FPPE. Both LFM and FPPE have an Eisenberg-Gale convex program characterization, the pillar upon which we derive our statistical theory. We start by deriving basic convergence results for the finite market to the limit market. We then derive asymptotic distributions, and construct confidence intervals. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic local minimax optimality of estimation based on finite markets. We then show that the theory can be used for conducting statistically valid A/B testing on auction platforms. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments verify the validity and practicality of our theory.</description>

      <title>Multimodal data integration and cross-modal querying via orchestrated approximate message passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The need for multimodal data integration arises naturally when multiple complementary sets of features are measured on the same sample. Under a dependent multifactor model, we develop a fully data-driven orchestrated approximate message passing algorithm for integrating information across these feature sets to achieve statistically optimal signal recovery. In practice, these reference data sets are often queried later by new subjects that are only partially observed. Leveraging on asymptotic normality of estimates generated by our data integration method, we further develop an asymptotically valid prediction set for the latent representation of any such query subject. We demonstrate the prowess of both the data integration and the prediction set construction algorithms on a tri-modal single-cell dataset.</description>
