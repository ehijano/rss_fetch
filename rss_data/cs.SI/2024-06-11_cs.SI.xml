      <title>Messengers: Breaking Echo Chambers in Collective Opinion Dynamics with Homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective estimation manifests computational intelligence emerging from inter-individual local interactions, e.g., by aggregating opinions from neighbors to estimate a quantity. Use cases of collective estimation may include directed motion in physical space, such that agents, for example, have to collectively explore a distributed feature, and collectively agree on a numerical value. In doing so, collectives face several challenges in achieving precise estimations. These challenges exhibit complex behaviors, particularly when the interaction network and opinion of agents evolve simultaneously. We take homophilic networks as an example, where disproportionate interaction with like-minded neighbors leads to the emergence of echo chambers, preventing collective consensus. Our simulation results confirm that, besides a lack of exposure to attitude-challenging opinions, seeking reaffirming information entraps agents in echo chambers. We propose a generic novel approach based on a Dichotomous Markov Process (DMP) where stubborn agents (called Messengers) connect the disconnected clusters by physically transporting their opinions to other clusters to inform and direct the other agents. We show that diverse collective behaviors arise from the DMP and study a continuum between task specialization with no switching (full-time Messengers), generalization with slow task switching (part-time Messengers), and rapid task switching (short-time Messengers) and its impact on system performance. Our results show that stubborn agents can, in various ways, break the echo chambers and promote consensus in collective opinion.</description>

      <title>Blended Bots: Infiltration through Identity Deception on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bots are automated social media users that can be used to amplify (mis)information and sow harmful discourse. In order to effectively influence users, bots can be generated to reproduce human user behavior. Indeed, people tend to trust information coming from users with profiles that fit roles they expect to exist, such as users with gender role stereotypes. In this work, we examine differences in the types of identities in profiles of human and bot accounts with a focus on combinations of identities that represent gender role stereotypes. We find that some types of identities differentiate between human and bot profiles, confirming this approach can be a useful in distinguishing between human and bot accounts on social media. However, contrary to our expectations, we reveal that gender bias is expressed more in human accounts than bots overall. Despite having less gender bias overall, we provide examples of identities with strong associations with gender identities in bot profiles, such as those related to technology, finance, sports, and horoscopes. Finally, we discuss implications for designing constructive social media bot detection training materials.</description>

      <title>A Shape Change Enhancing Hierarchical Layout for the Pairwise Comparison of Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing directed acyclic graphs is essential in various fields such as healthcare, social media, finance, biology, and marketing. DAGs often result from contagion processes over networks, including information spreading, retweet activity, disease transmission, financial crisis propagation, malware spread, and gene mutations. For instance, in disease spreading, an infected patient can transmit the disease to contacts, making it crucial to analyze and predict scenarios. Similarly, in finance, understanding the effects of saving or not saving specific banks during a crisis is vital. Experts often need to identify small differences between DAGs, such as changes in a few nodes or edges. Even the presence or absence of a single edge can be significant. Visualization plays a crucial role in facilitating these comparisons. However, standard hierarchical layout algorithms struggle to visualize subtle changes effectively. The typical hierarchical layout, with the root on top, is preferred due to its performance in comparison to other layouts. Nevertheless, these standard algorithms prioritize single-graph aesthetics over comparison suitability, making it challenging for users to spot changes. To address this issue, we propose a layout that enhances shape changes in DAGs while minimizing the impact on aesthetics. Our approach involves outwardly swapping changes, altering the DAG's shape. We introduce new drawing criteria. Our layout builds upon a Sugiyama-like hierarchical layout and implements these criteria through two extensions. We designed it this way to maintain interchangeability and accommodate future optimizations, such as pseudo-nodes for edge crossing minimization. In our evaluations, our layout achieves excellent results, with edge crossing aesthetics averaging around 0.8 (on a scale of 0 to 1). Additionally, our layout outperforms the base implementation by an average of 60-75\%.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Communications for Space Domain Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space Domain Awareness (SDA) has become increasingly vital with the rapid growth of commercial space activities and the expansion of New Space. This paper stresses the necessity of transitioning from centralized to distributed SDA architectures. The current architecture predominantly relies on individual downhaul, which we propose to transition to on-orbit distribution. Our results demonstrate that the individual downhaul architecture does not scale efficiently with the increasing number of nodes, while on-orbit distribution offers significant improvements. By comparing the centralized architecture with the proposed distributed architecture, we highlight the advantages of enhanced coverage and resilience. Our findings show that on-orbit distribution greatly outperforms individual downhaul in terms of latency and scalability. Specifically, the latency results for on-orbit distribution are substantially lower and more consistent, even as the number of satellites increases. In addition, we address the inherent challenges associated with on-orbit distribution architecture, particularly cybersecurity concerns. We focus on link security to ensure the availability and integrity of data transmission in these advanced SDA systems. Future expectations include further refinement of on-orbit distribution strategies and the development of robust cybersecurity measures to support the scalability and resilience of SDA systems.</description>

      <title>Network two-sample test for block models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-sample testing problem for networks, where the goal is to determine whether two sets of networks originated from the same stochastic model. Assuming no vertex correspondence and allowing for different numbers of nodes, we address a fundamental network testing problem that goes beyond simple adjacency matrix comparisons. We adopt the stochastic block model (SBM) for network distributions, due to their interpretability and the potential to approximate more general models. The lack of meaningful node labels and vertex correspondence translate to a graph matching challenge when developing a test for SBMs. We introduce an efficient algorithm to match estimated network parameters, allowing us to properly combine and contrast information within and across samples, leading to a powerful test. We show that the matching algorithm, and the overall test are consistent, under mild conditions on the sparsity of the networks and the sample sizes, and derive a chi-squared asymptotic null distribution for the test. Through a mixture of theoretical insights and empirical validations, including experiments with both synthetic and real-world data, this study advances robust statistical inference for complex network data.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Indirect Gender Discrimination on Collaborative Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.01093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital collaborative platforms have become crucial venues of career advancement and individual success in many creative fields, from engineering to the arts. Indirect gender discrimination is a key component to gendered disadvantage on platforms. Such platforms carried the promise of opening avenues of advancement to previously discriminated groups, such as women, as platforms lack managerial gatekeepers with conventional prejudice. We analyzed the extent of indirect gender discriminatory on two diverse platforms, GitHub and Behance, focused on software development and fine arts and design. We found that the main cause of women's disadvantage in attention, success, and survival is largely due to indirect discrimination that varies between 60-90\% of total female disadvantage. Men and women are penalized if they follow highly female-like behavior, while categorical gender's impact varies by outcome and field. As platforms employ algorithmic tools and AI systems to manage users' activity, visibility and recommend new projects to collaborate, stereotypes rooted in behavior can have long-lasting consequences.</description>

      <title>QuickCent: a fast and frugal heuristic for harmonic centrality estimation on scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple and quick method to approximate network centrality indexes. Our approach, called QuickCent, is inspired by so-called fast and frugal heuristics, which are heuristics initially proposed to model some human decision and inference processes. The centrality index that we estimate is the harmonic centrality, which is a measure based on shortest-path distances, so infeasible to compute on large networks. We compare QuickCent with known machine learning algorithms on synthetic data generated with preferential attachment, and some empirical networks. Our experiments show that QuickCent is able to make estimates that are competitive in accuracy with the best alternative methods tested, either on synthetic scale-free networks or empirical networks. QuickCent has the feature of achieving low error variance estimates, even with a small training set. Moreover, QuickCent is comparable in efficiency -- accuracy and time cost -- to those produced by more complex methods. We discuss and provide some insight into how QuickCent exploits the fact that in some networks, such as those generated by preferential attachment, local density measures such as the in-degree, can be a proxy for the size of the network region to which a node has access, opening up the possibility of approximating centrality indices based on size such as the harmonic centrality. Our initial results show that simple heuristics and biologically inspired computational methods are a promising line of research in the context of network measure estimations.</description>

      <title>Video Recommendation Using Social Network Analysis and User Viewing Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel video recommendation approach that leverages implicit user feedback in the form of viewing percentages and social network analysis techniques. By constructing a video similarity network based on user viewing patterns and computing centrality measures, the methodology identifies important and well-connected videos. Modularity analysis is then used to cluster closely related videos, forming the basis for personalized recommendations. For each user, candidate videos are selected from the cluster containing their preferred items and ranked using an ego-centric index that measures proximity to the user's likes and dislikes. The proposed approach was evaluated on real user data from an Asian video-on-demand platform. Offline experiments demonstrated improved accuracy compared to conventional methods such as Naive Bayes, SVM, decision trees, and nearest neighbor algorithms. An online user study further validated the effectiveness of the recommendations, with significant increases observed in click-through rate, view completion rate, and user satisfaction scores relative to the platform's existing system. These results underscore the value of incorporating implicit feedback and social network analysis for video recommendations. The key contributions of this research include a novel video recommendation framework that integrates implicit user data and social network analysis, the use of centrality measures and modularity-based clustering, an ego-centric ranking approach, and rigorous offline and online evaluation demonstrating superior performance compared to existing techniques. This study opens new avenues for enhancing video recommendations and user engagement in VOD platforms.</description>

      <title>Evading Community Detection via Counterfactual Neighborhood Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection techniques are useful for social media platforms to discover tightly connected groups of users who share common interests. However, this functionality often comes at the expense of potentially exposing individuals to privacy breaches by inadvertently revealing their tastes or preferences. Therefore, some users may wish to preserve their anonymity and opt out of community detection for various reasons, such as affiliation with political or religious organizations, without leaving the platform. In this study, we address the challenge of community membership hiding, which involves strategically altering the structural properties of a network graph to prevent one or more nodes from being identified by a given community detection algorithm. We tackle this problem by formulating it as a constrained counterfactual graph objective, and we solve it via deep reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, striking the best balance between accuracy and cost.</description>

      <title>Individual misinformation tagging reinforces echo chambers; Collective tagging does not</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fears about the destabilizing impact of misinformation online have motivated individuals and platforms to respond. Individuals have become empowered to challenge others' online claims with fact-checks in pursuit of a healthier information ecosystem and to break down echo chambers of self-reinforcing opinion. Using Twitter data, here we show the consequences of individual misinformation tagging: tagged posters had explored novel political information and expanded topical interests immediately prior, but being tagged caused posters to retreat into information bubbles. These unintended consequences were softened by a collective verification system for misinformation moderation. In Twitter's new platform, Community Notes, misinformation tagging was peer-reviewed by other fact-checkers before exposure to the poster. With collective misinformation tagging, posters were less likely to retreat from diverse information engagement. Detailed comparison suggests differences in toxicity, sentiment, readability, and delay in individual versus collective misinformation tagging messages. These findings provide evidence for differential impacts from individual versus collective moderation strategies on the diversity of information engagement and mobility across the information ecosystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In existing models and embedding methods of networked systems, node features describing their qualities are usually overlooked in favor of focusing solely on node connectivity. This study introduces $FiD$-Mercator, a model-based ultra-low dimensional reduction technique that integrates node features with network structure to create $D$-dimensional maps of complex networks in a hyperbolic space. This embedding method efficiently uses features as an initial condition, guiding the search of nodes' coordinates towards an optimal solution. The research reveals that downstream task performance improves with the correlation between network connectivity and features, emphasizing the importance of such correlation for enhancing the description and predictability of real networks. Simultaneously, hyperbolic embedding's ability to reproduce local network properties remains unaffected by the inclusion of features. The findings highlight the necessity for developing network embedding techniques capable of exploiting such correlations to optimize both network structure and feature association jointly in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic brought about an extraordinary rate of scientific papers on the topic that were discussed among the general public, although often in biased or misinformed ways. In this paper, we present a mixed-methods analysis aimed at examining whether public discussions were commensurate with the scientific consensus on several COVID-19 issues. We estimate scientific consensus based on samples of abstracts from preprint servers and compare against the volume of public discussions on Twitter mentioning these papers. We find that anti-consensus posts and users, though overall less numerous than pro-consensus ones, are vastly over-represented on Twitter, thus producing a false consensus effect. This transpires with favorable papers being disproportionately amplified, along with an influx of new anti-consensus user sign-ups. Finally, our content analysis highlights that anti-consensus users misrepresent scientific findings or question scientists' integrity in their efforts to substantiate their claims.</description>

      <title>LLM as Prompter: Low-resource Inductive Reasoning on Arbitrary Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) inductive reasoning, which aims to infer missing facts from new KGs that are not seen during training, has been widely adopted in various applications. One critical challenge of KG inductive reasoning is handling low-resource scenarios with scarcity in both textual and structural aspects. In this paper, we attempt to address this challenge with Large Language Models (LLMs). Particularly, we utilize the state-of-the-art LLMs to generate a graph-structural prompt to enhance the pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which brings us new methodological insights into the KG inductive reasoning methods, as well as high generalizability in practice. On the methodological side, we introduce a novel pretraining and prompting framework ProLINK, designed for low-resource inductive reasoning across arbitrary KGs without requiring additional training. On the practical side, we experimentally evaluate our approach on 36 low-resource KG datasets and find that ProLINK outperforms previous methods in three-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot reasoning tasks, exhibiting average performance improvements by 20%, 45%, and 147%, respectively. Furthermore, ProLINK demonstrates strong robustness for various LLM promptings as well as full-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>FedHCDR: Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation with Hypergraph Signal Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has drawn significant attention, which utilizes user data from multiple domains to enhance the recommendation performance. However, current CDR methods require sharing user data across domains, thereby violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed for Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation (FedCDR). Nevertheless, the data heterogeneity across different domains inevitably influences the overall performance of federated learning. In this study, we propose FedHCDR, a novel Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation framework with Hypergraph signal decoupling. Specifically, to address the data heterogeneity across domains, we introduce an approach called hypergraph signal decoupling (HSD) to decouple the user features into domain-exclusive and domain-shared features. The approach employs high-pass and low-pass hypergraph filters to decouple domain-exclusive and domain-shared user representations, which are trained by the local-global bi-directional transfer algorithm. In addition, a hypergraph contrastive learning (HCL) module is devised to enhance the learning of domain-shared user relationship information by perturbing the user hypergraph. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world scenarios demonstrate that FedHCDR outperforms existing baselines significantly.</description>

      <title>Simple Network Mechanism Leads to Quasi-Real Brain Activation Patterns with Drosophila Connectome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering the high computational demands of most methods, using network communication models to simulate the brain is a more economical way. However, there is still insufficient evidence that they can effectively replicate the brains' real activation patterns. Moreover, it remains unclear whether actual network structures are crucial in simulating intelligence. Addressing these issues, we propose a large scale network communication model based on simple rules and design criteria to assess the differences between network models and real situations. To enhance the connection with the real world, we also incorporate an improved neuron dynamic model. We conduct research on the biggest adult Drosophila connectome data set. Experimental results show significant activation in neurons that should respond to stimulus and slight activation in irrelevant ones, which we call quasi-real activation pattern. Besides, when changing the network structure, the quasi-activation patterns disappear. Interestingly, activation regions have shorter network distances to their input neurons, implying that the network structure (not spatial distance) is the core to form brain functionality. In addition, giving input neurons a unilateral stimulus, we observe a bilateral response, which is consistent with reality. Then we find that both hemispheres have extremely similar statistical indicators. We also develop real-time 3D large spatial network visualization software to observe experimental phenomena, filling the software gap. This research reveals network models' power: it can reach the quasi-activation pattern with simple rules. Besides, it proves network structure matters in brain activity pattern generation. Future research could fully simulate brain behavior through network models, paving the way for artificial intelligence by developing new propagation rules and optimizing link weights.</description>

      <title>Channel Reciprocity Based Attack Detection for Securing UWB Ranging by Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of ranging threats represented by Ghost Peak attack have raised concerns regarding the security performance of Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) systems with the finalization of the IEEE 802.15.4z standard. Based on channel reciprocity, this paper proposes a low complexity attack detection scheme that compares Channel Impulse Response (CIR) features of both ranging sides utilizing an autoencoder with the capability of data compression and feature extraction. Taking Ghost Peak attack as an example, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness, feasibility and generalizability of the proposed attack detection scheme through simulation and experimental validation. The proposed scheme achieves an attack detection success rate of over 99% and can be implemented in current systems at low cost.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguring Participatory Design to Resist AI Realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing trend of artificial intelligence (AI) as a solution to social and technical problems reinforces AI Realism -- the belief that AI is an inevitable and natural order. In response, this paper argues that participatory design (PD), with its focus on democratic values and processes, can play a role in questioning and resisting AI Realism. I examine three concerning aspects of AI Realism: the facade of democratization that lacks true empowerment, demands for human adaptability in contrast to AI systems' inflexibility, and the obfuscation of essential human labor enabling the AI system. I propose resisting AI Realism by reconfiguring PD to continue engaging with value-centered visions, increasing its exploration of non-AI alternatives, and making the essential human labor underpinning AI systems visible. I position PD as a means to generate friction against AI Realism and open space for alternative futures centered on human needs and values.</description>
