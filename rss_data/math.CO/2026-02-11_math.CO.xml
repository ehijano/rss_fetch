      <title>Temperley-Lieb Immanants, Key Positivity, and Demazure Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to extend three important Schur positivity results to key positivity, replacing all Schur polynomials in relevant expressions with flagged Schur polynomials. Namely, we first show that the Temperley-Lieb immanants of (many) flagged Jacobi-Trudi matrices are key positive. Using this result, we give a combinatorial rule for the key expansion of (most) products of flagged skew Schur polynomials, and also give a log concavity result inspired by that of Lam-Postnikov-Pylyavskyy. The main tools in our proofs are Demazure crystals, and the recently defined shuffle tableaux of Nguyen and Pylyavskyy. In order to prove our main results, we must develop a new characterization of Demazure crystals, which builds off of prior work of Assaf and Gonzalez. This characterization may be useful in other contexts.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Proof of Cayley's Formula via Degree Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cayley's formula is a fundamental result in combinatorics that counts the number of labeled trees on n vertices. While existing proofs use approaches such as Prufer sequences and the Matrix-Tree Theorem, we give a combinatorial proof that highlights the role of degree sequences and structural properties of labeled trees. Our goal is to provide an accessible perspective and suggest connections to related enumeration problems.</description>

      <title>The minimum spectral radius of $tP_4$-saturated graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called {\em$F$-saturated} if $G$ does not contain $F$ as a subgraph but adding any missing edge to $G$ creates a copy of $F$. In this paper, we consider the spectral saturation problem for the linear forest $tP_4$, proving that every $n$-vertex $tP_4$-saturated graph $G$ with $t\geq 2$ and $n\ge 4t$ satisfies $\rho(G)\ge \frac{1+\sqrt{17}}{2}$, and characterizing all $tP_4$-saturated graphs for which equality holds. Moreover, we obtain that, for $t=2$ with odd $n\ge 13 $, and for $t\ge 3$ with $n\ge 6t+4$, the set of $n$-vertex $tP_4$-saturated graphs minimizing the spectral radius is disjoint from that minimizing the number of edges.</description>

      <title>On Euler Paths and the Maximum Degree Growth of Iterated Higher Order Line Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a simple graph $G$, its line graph, denoted by $L(G)$, is obtained by representing each edge of $G$ as a vertex, with two vertices in $L(G)$ adjacent whenever the corresponding edges in $G$ share a common endpoint. By applying the line graph operation repeatedly, we obtain higher order line graphs, denoted by $L^{r}(G)$. In other words, $L^{0}(G) = G$, and for any integer $r \ge 1$, $L^{r}(G) = L(L^{r-1}(G))$.
  Given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, we wish to efficiently find out (i) if $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path, (ii) the value of $\Delta(L^k(G))$. Note that the size of a higher order line graph could be much larger than that of $G$.
  For the first question, we show that for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges the largest $k$ where $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path satisfies $k = \mathcal O(nm)$. We also design an $\mathcal{O}(n^2m)$-time algorithm to output all $k$ such that $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path.
  For the second question, we study the growth of maximum degree of $L^k(G)$, $k \ge 0$. It is easy to calculate $\Delta(L^k(G))$ when $G$ is a path, cycle or a claw. Any other connected graph is called a prolific graph and we denote the set of all prolific graphs by $\mathcal G$. We extend the works of Hartke and Higgins to show that for any prolific graph $G$, there exists a constant rational number $dgc(G)$ and an integer $k_0$ such that for all $k \ge k_0$, $\Delta(L^k(G)) = dgc(G) \cdot 2^{k-4} + 2$. We show that $\{dgc(G) \mid G \in \mathcal G\}$ has first, second, third, fourth and fifth minimums, namely, $c_1 = 3$, $c_2 = 4$, $c_3 = 5.5$, $c_4 = 6$ and $c_5=7$; the third minimum stands out surprisingly from the other four. Moreover, for $i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, we provide a complete characterization of $\mathcal G_i = \{dgc(G) = c_i \mid G \in \mathcal G \}$. Apart from this, we show that the set $\{dgc(G) \mid G \in \mathcal G, 7 &lt; dgc(G) &lt; 8\}$ is countably infinite.</description>

      <title>Shellability in Clique-Free Complexes of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study combinatorial and algebraic properties of $t$-clique-free complexes, a family of simplicial complexes associated with finite simple graphs that generalize the classical independence complex. For a graph $G$ and an integer $t \ge 2$, the $t$-clique-free complex $\mathsf{CF}_t(G)$ is the simplicial complex on the vertex set of $G$ whose faces are the subsets inducing no cliques of size $t$.
  Our main results provide sufficient conditions for shellability and related decomposability properties of $t$-clique-free complexes. In particular, we show that if $G$ is a $t$-diamond-free chordal graph (in particular, a block graph), then $\mathsf{CF}_t(G)$ is $(t-2)$-decomposable and hence shellable. We also investigate how graph modifications via clique attachments influence shellability. Generalizing earlier constructions involving whiskers and clique extensions, we introduce the following operation: given a graph $H$, a subset $S \subseteq V(H)$, and an integer $t \ge 2$, we form a graph $\operatorname{Cl}(H,S,t)$ by attaching to each vertex in $S$ a clique of size at least $t$. We prove that $\mathsf{CF}_t(H\setminus S)$ is shellable if and only if $\mathsf{CF}_t(\operatorname{Cl}(H,S,t))$ is shellable. This yields a flexible method for constructing shellable complexes, particularly when $S$ is a cycle cover. In addition, we extend the notion of clique whiskering and show that for any graph admitting a clique vertex-partition, the resulting $t$-clique whiskering produces a pure and shellable, and hence Cohen-Macaulay, $t$-clique-free complex.
  Finally, we establish a Fr\"oberg-type result linking chordality and linear resolutions. We show that for any chordal graph $G$, the edge ideal of the complement $t$-clique clutter $\overline{\mathcal{CH}_t(G)}$ admits a $t$-linear resolution over any field.</description>

      <title>An Erd\H{o}s--Trotter problem on antichains with multiplicity $r$ on each occurring level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix an integer $r\ge2$. For each $n$ we consider families $\mathcal F\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ that form an antichain and have the property that, for every $t$, if there exists $A\in\mathcal F$ with $|A|=t$ then there exist at least $r$ members of $\mathcal F$ of size $t$. A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Trotter asserts that, for each fixed $r$, there exists a threshold $n_0(r)$ such that whenever $n&gt;n_0(r)$ one can achieve $n-3$ distinct set sizes in such a family, and asks for estimates on $n_0(r)$. We compute that $n_0(2)=3$ and $n_0(3)=8$. For all $r\ge4$ we prove matching linear bounds up to lower-order terms, namely $$ 2r+2 \le n_0(r) \le 2r+2\log_2 r + O(\log_2\log_2 r). $$</description>

      <title>Characterizing Large Clique Number in Tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aboulker, Aubian, Charbit, and Lopes (2023) defined the clique number of a tournament to be the minimum clique number of one of its backedge graphs. Here we show that if $T$ is a tournament of sufficiently large clique number, then $T$ contains a subtournament of large clique number from one of two simple families of tournaments. In particular, large clique number is always certified by a bounded-size set. This answers a question of Aboulker, Aubian, Charbit, and Lopes (2023), and gives new insight into a line of research initiated by Kim and Kim (2018) into unavoidable subtournaments in tournaments with large dichromatic number.</description>

      <title>Grouped Stirling complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a configuration space of $G$ can be thought of as the set of all possible configurations of "robots" which can move throughout $G$, subject to some constraints. We introduce a type of configuration space which we call Grouped Stirling complexes, denoted by $S_{\vec r}(G)$, in which we place robots in groups subject to two constraints. First, there must be at least one robot on each vertex of $G$, and second, any two robots from the same group must be "separated by at least one full open edge" of $G$. The space $S_{\vec r}(G)$ has a closed cell structure, which means it can be built out of cells of various dimensions. Our main results show $S_{\vec r}(G)$ is path-connected, provided there are at least three groups, and determine the number of cells of $S_{\vec r}(G)$ in certain cases.</description>

      <title>On the minimum number of entries in a pair of maximal orthogonal partial Latin squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that if $F$ denotes the number of filled cells in a superimposed pair of maximal orthogonal partial Latin squares of order $n$, then $F\ge n^2/3$. This resolves a conjecture raised in an earlier paper by the current authors. It is also shown that, for $n\ge 21$, the least possible number of filled cells in a pair of maximal orthogonal partial Latin squares is $\lceil n^2/3 \rceil$, and that the structure that achieves this bound is unique up to permutations of rows, columns and entries.</description>

      <title>Non-Additive Discrepancy: Coverage Functions in a Beck-Fiala Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent concurrent work by Dupr\'{e} la Tour and Fujii and by Hollender, Manurangsi, Meka, and Suksompong [ITCS'26] introduced a generalization of classical discrepancy theory to non-additive functions, motivated by applications in fair division. As many classical techniques from discrepancy theory seem to fail in this setting, including linear algebraic methods like the Beck-Fiala Theorem [Discrete Appl. Math '81], it remains widely open whether comparable non-additive bounds can be achieved.
  Towards a better understanding of non-additive discrepancy, we study coverage functions in a sparse setting comparable to the classical Beck-Fiala Theorem. Our setting generalizes the additive Beck-Fiala setting, rank functions of partition matroids, and edge coverage in graphs. More precisely, assuming each of the $n$ items covers only $t$ elements across all functions, we prove a constructive discrepancy bound that is polynomial in $t$, the number of colors $k$, and $\log n$.</description>

      <title>List and total colorings of multiset permutation graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ and $\ell$ be positive integers. The multiset star transposition graph ST$_k^\ell$ has as vertices the $k\ell$-strings $v_0\cdots v_{k\ell-1}$ on $k$ symbols, each symbol repeated $\ell$ times, and edges given by the transpositions $(v_0\;v_i)$ with $v_i\ne v_0$ ($0&lt;i&lt;k\ell$). It is shown for $k&gt;1$ and $\ell&gt;2$ that ST$_k^\ell$ is $(\ell-1)$-choosable and that, as a result, admits total colorings. In order to prove such assertions, the notion of efficient domination set (or E-set) of a graph is generalized for $\ell&gt;1$ to that of an efficient dominating$\,^\ell$-set and applied to the graphs ST$_k^\ell$\,, showing they admit vertex partitions that generalize the Dejter-Serra partitions of ST$_k^1$ into E-sets, but not efficiently in the sense that the distance of each E$^\ell$-set be 3. Efficiently in such sense however, $ST^2_k$ and the related 2-set pancake permutation graph PC$^2_k$, among other intermediate permutation graphs, are shown to admit total colorings with $2k-1$ colors that determine partitions into $2k-1$ E-sets, each with distance 3.
  Furthermore, associated E-chains are examined.</description>

Abstract: A homogeneous bivariate $d$-form defines an $(i+1)$-rowed Toeplitz matrix for each $i$ between $0$ and $d$. We use Hodge theory and Schur polynomials to prove that if the $(i+1)$-rowed Toeplitz matrix of a form is totally nonnegative, then so is the $i$-rowed one. This fixes a gap in the main result of paper above.</description>

      <title>Systematic Enumeration of Fundamental Quantities Involving Runs in Binary Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give recurrences, generating functions and explicit exact expressions for the enumeration of fundamental quantities involving runs in binary strings. We first focus on enumerations concerning runs of ones, and we then analyse the same enumerations when runs of ones and runs of zeros are jointly considered. We give the connections between these two types of run enumeration, and with the problem of compositions. We also analyse the same enumerations with a Hamming weight constraint. We discuss which of the many number sequences that emerge from these problems are already known and listed in the OEIS. Additionally, we extend our main enumerative results to the probabilistic scenario in which binary strings are outcomes of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli variables.</description>

      <title>Almost all graphs are vertex-minor universal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Answering a question of Claudet, we prove that the uniformly random graph $G\sim \mathbb G(n, 1/2)$ is $\Omega(\sqrt n)$-vertex-minor universal with high probability. That is, for some constant $\alpha\approx 0.911$, any graph on any $\alpha\sqrt n$ specified vertices of $G$ can be obtained as a vertex-minor of $G$. This has direct implications for quantum communications networks: an $n$-vertex $k$-vertex-minor universal graph corresponds to an $n$-qubit $k$-stabilizer universal graph state, which has the property that one can induce any stabilizer state on any $k$ qubits using only local operations and classical communications.
  We further employ our methods in two other contexts. We obtain a bipartite pivot-minor version of our main result, and we use it to derive a universality statement for minors in random binary matroids. We also introduce the vertex-minor Ramsey number $R_{\mathrm{vm}}(k)$ to be the smallest value $n$ such that every $n$-vertex graph contains an independent set of size $k$ as a vertex-minor. Supported by our main result, we conjecture that $R_{\mathrm{vm}}(k)$ is polynomial in $k$. We prove $\Omega(k^2) \leq R_{\mathrm{vm}}(k) \leq 2^k - 1$.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of the universal Picard stack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{S}_n$-equivariant topological and weight-graded compactly-supported Euler characteristics of the universal Picard stack $\mathrm{Pic}_{g, n}^d \to \mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ of degree-$d$ line bundles over $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$. We prove that in the weight-zero and topological cases, the generating function for Euler characteristics of $\mathrm{Pic}_{g, n}^d$ is obtained from the corresponding one for $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ by an extremely simple combinatorial transformation. This lets us deduce closed formulas for the two generating functions, taking as input the Chan--Faber--Galatius--Payne formula in the weight-zero case and Gorsky's formula in the topological case. As a corollary, we also obtain a closed formula for the topological Euler characteristic of $\mathrm{Pic}^d_g$. Our weight-zero calculation is a corollary of a general result passing from the weight-graded Euler characteristics of $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ to those of $\mathrm{Pic}_{g,n}^d$.</description>

      <title>Total positivity in twisted flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Kac-Moody group, split over $\mathbb R$. The totally nonnegative part of $G$ and its (ordinary) flag variety $G/B^+$ was introduced by Lusztig. It is known that the totally nonnegative parts of $G$ and $G/B^+$ have remarkable combinatorial and topological properties.
  In this paper, we consider the totally nonnegative part of the $J$-twisted flag variety $G/{}^J B^+$, where ${}^J B^+$ is the Borel subgroup opposite to $B^+$ in the standard parabolic subgroup $P_J^+$ of $G$. The $J$-twisted flag varieties include the ordinary flag variety $G/B^+$ as a special case. Our main result show that the totally nonnegative part of $G/{}^J B^+$ decomposes into cells, and the closure of each cell is a regular CW complex. This generalizes the work of Galashin-Karp-Lam \cite{GKL22} and the joint work of Bao with the first author \cite{BH24} for ordinary flag varieties.
  As an application, we deduce that the totally nonnegative part of the double flag variety $G/B^+ \times G/B^-$ with respect to the diagonal $G$-action has similar nice properties. We also establish some connections between the totally nonnegative part of the double flag with the canonical basis of the tensor product of a lowest weight module with a highest weight module of $G$.
  As another application, we show that the link of identity in a totally nonnegative reduced double Bruhat cell of $G$ is a regular CW complex. This generalizes the work of Hersh \cite{Her14} on the link of $U_{\geq0}^-$ and gives a positive answer to an open question of Fomin and Zelevinsky.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of Sandwich Problems for $M$-partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a structural classification of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) described by reflexive complete $2$-edge-coloured graphs. In particular, this classification extends the structural dichotomy for graph homomorphism problems known as the Hell--Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il theorem (1990). Our classification is also efficient: we can check in polynomial time whether the CSP of a reflexive complete $2$-edge-coloured graph is in P or NP-complete, whereas for arbitrary $2$-edge-coloured graphs, this task is NP-complete. We then apply our main result in the context of matrix partition problems and sandwich problems. Firstly, we obtain one of the few algorithmic solutions to general classes of matrix partition problems. And secondly, we present a P vs. NP-complete classification of sandwich problems for matrix partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a refined version of Markov's theorem in Diophantine approximation. More precisely, we characterize completely the set of irrationals $x$ such that $\left|x-\frac{p}{q}\right|&lt;\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions: their continued fraction is eventually a balanced sequence through a simple coding. As consequence, we show that all such numbers are either quadratic surds or transcendental numbers. In particular, for any algebraic real number $x$ of degree at least $3$ there are infinitely rational numbers $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $\left|x-\frac{p}{q}\right|&lt;\frac{1}{3q^2}$.</description>

      <title>Well-quasi-orders on finite trees and transfinite sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the well-quasi-order (wqo) consisting of the set of finite trees with leaf labels coming from an arbitrary wqo $Q$, ordered by tree homomorphisms which respect the order on the labels. This is a variant of the usual Kruskal tree ordering without infima preservation. We calculate the precise maximal order types of this class of wqos as a function of the maximal order type of the labels $Q$. In the process, we sharpen some recent results of Friedman and Weiermann. Furthermore, we show a correspondence with indecomposable transfinite sequences with finite range, over elements of the wqo $Q$, of length less than $\omega^\omega$. Nash-Williams proved that arbitrary transfinite sequences with finite range are also well-quasi-ordered, but there are no known methods to extract bounds on the maximal order type from the proof. More concrete proofs for sequences of length less than $\alpha$ for some $\alpha &lt; \omega^\omega$ were given by Erd\H{o}s and Rado. Using the correspondence, we obtain precise bounds for the entire collection of transfinite sequences with finite range of length less than $\omega^\omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During 2022--2023 Z.-W. Sun posed many conjectures on infinite series with summands involving generalized harmonic numbers. Motivated by this, we deduce $58$ series identities involving harmonic numbers, eight of which were previously conjectured by the second author. For example, we obtain that \[ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{k^2{2k \choose k}{3k \choose k}} \left( \frac{7 k-2}{2 k-1} H_{k-1}^{(2)}-\frac{3}{4 k^2} \right) = \frac{\pi^4}{720}. \] and \[ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2 {2k \choose k}^2} \left( \frac{30k-11}{k(2k-1)} (H_{2k-1}^{(3)} + 2 H_{k-1}^{(3)}) + \frac{27}{8k^4} \right) = 4 \zeta(3)^2, \] where $H_n^{(m)}$ denotes $\sum_{0&lt;j \le n}j^{-m}$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of maps with tight boundaries and the Zhukovsky transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider maps with tight boundaries, i.e. maps whose boundaries have minimal length in their homotopy class, and discuss the properties of their generating functions $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$ for fixed genus $g$ and prescribed boundary lengths $\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n$, with a control on the degrees of inner faces. We find that these series appear as coefficients in the expansion of $\omega^{(g)}_n(z_1,\ldots,z_n)$, a fundamental quantity in the Eynard-Orantin theory of topological recursion, thereby providing a combinatorial interpretation of the Zhukovsky transformation used in this context. This interpretation results from the so-called trumpet decomposition of maps with arbitrary boundaries. In the planar bipartite case, we obtain a fully explicit formula for $T^{(0)}_{2\ell_1,\ldots,2\ell_n}$ from the Collet-Fusy formula. We also find recursion relations satisfied by $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$, which consist in adding an extra tight boundary, keeping the genus $g$ fixed. Building on a result of Norbury and Scott, we show that $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$ is equal to a parity-dependent quasi-polynomial in $\ell_1^2,\ldots,\ell_n^2$ times a simple power of the basic generating function $R$. In passing, we provide a bijective derivation in the case $(g,n)=(0,3)$, generalizing a recent construction of ours to the non bipartite case.</description>

      <title>The General Position Problem: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19385v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a chessboard puzzle of Dudeney, the general position problem in graph theory asks for a largest set $S$ of vertices in a graph such that no three elements of $S$ lie on a common shortest path. The number of vertices in such a largest set is the \emph{general position number} of the graph. This paper provides a survey of this rapidly growing problem, which now has an extensive literature. We cover exact results for various graph classes and the behaviour of the general position number under graph products and operations. We also discuss interesting variations of the general position problem, including those corresponding to different graph convexities, as well as dynamic, fractional, colouring and game versions of the problem.</description>

      <title>A quantitative way to e-positivity of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2020, Dahlberg, She, and van Willigenburg conjectured that the chromatic symmetric function of any tree with maximum degree at least 4 is not e-positive. Zheng and Tom verified this conjecture for all trees with maximum degree at least 5 and spiders with maximum degree 4, and in their proofs the following necessary condition given by Wolfgang plays an important role: every connected graph having e-positive chromatic symmetric function must contain a connected partition of every type.
  In order to make further progress on this conjecture, we refine Wolfgang's result in a quantitative way. At first, we give an explicit formula for the e-coefficients of trees in terms of their connected partitions, by which e-positivity is equivalent to a series of inequalities for the numbers of connected partitions. Based on this formula, we present several necessary conditions on the numbers of connected partitions or acyclic orientations for trees to be e-positive. These necessary conditions turn out to be characterizations on the structure of e-positive trees, and as sample applications we prove the non-e-positivity of several classes of trees with maximum degree 3 or 4. We further make more discussions and calculations on trees with maximum degree 4 and having a connected partition of every type, which inspire us to come up with a list of open problems towards the final resolution of the above conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of signomials whose positive support is the set of vertices of a simplex and which may have several negative support points in the simplex. Various groups of authors have provided an exact characterization for the global nonnegativity of a signomial in this class in terms of circuit signomials and that characterization provides a tractable nonnegativity test. We generalize this characterization to the constrained nonnegativity over a set $X$ under an additional convexity precondition in the exponential moment space. This provides a tractable nonnegativity test over $X$ for the class in terms of a power cone program. Our proof methods rely on a variant of the convex cone of constrained SAGE signomials (sums of arithmetic-geometric exponentials) and the duality theory.</description>

      <title>Is it easy to regularize a hypergraph with easy links?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partition of a (hyper)graph is $\varepsilon$-homogenous if the edge densities between almost all clusters are either at most $\varepsilon$ or at least $1-\varepsilon$. Suppose a $3$-graph has the property that the link of every vertex has an $\varepsilon$-homogenous partition of size $\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$. Does this guarantee that the $3$-graph also has a small homogenous partition? Terry and Wolf proved that such a $3$-graph has an $\varepsilon$-homogenous partition of size given by a wowzer-type function. Terry recently improved this to a double exponential bound, and conjectured that this bound is tight. Our first result in this paper disproves this conjecture by giving an improved (single) exponential bound, which is best possible. We further obtain an analogous result for $k$-graphs of all uniformities $k \geq 3$.
  The above problem is part of a much broader programme which seeks to understand the conditions under which a (hyper)graph has small $\varepsilon$-regular partitions. While this problem is fairly well understood for graphs, the situation is (as always) much more involved already for $3$-graphs. For example, it is natural to ask if one can strengthen our first result by only requiring each link to have $\varepsilon$-regular partitions of size $\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$. Our second result shows that surprisingly the answer is `no', namely, a $3$-graph might only have regular partitions of tower-type size, even though the link of every vertex has an $\varepsilon$-regular partition of polynomial size.</description>

Abstract: Automated proof assistants are a technology pre-empting mistakes in mathematics. In our practice we have seen that reasoning about planar diagrams is difficult to both humans and computers. One example that has led to wrong statements in publications is that an orientation-preserving mapping is not always defined by how it acts on triples of elements. In this paper we formalise orientation-preserving mappings in proof assistant software Lean and report on our take-aways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the 2-limited packing problem: for a graph $G=(V,E)$ one seeks to find a maximum cardinality subset $B\subseteq V$, such that, for all $v\in V$, the closed neighbourhood of $v$ contains at most two vertices in $B$. We compare this packing problem to the well-known Roman domination problem by pointing out some similarities and differences in the behaviour of the optimal solutions of both problems and show that these two problems are weakly dual. We show that for trees, the two problems are strongly dual, letting us solve the Roman domination problem by computing an optimal solution to the 2-limited packing problem.</description>

      <title>Three lectures on tropical algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document is a slightly expanded version of a series of talks given by J. Giansiracusa at the workshop `Geometry over semirings' at Universitat Aut\`{o}noma de Barcelona in July 2025. In the first lecture we introduce tropical polynomials, ideals, congruences, and how the connection with tropical geometry is made via congruences of bend relations. Tropical geometry and matroid theory are telling us that we should focus attention on a narrow slice of the world of tropical algebra, and this leads to the theory of tropical ideals (as developed by Maclagan and Rinc\'{o}n) and an abundance of interesting open questions. In the second lecture we examine the relationship between Berkovich analytification and tropicalization from the perspective of bend relations, giving a refinement of Payne's influential limit theorem. In the third lecture we set aside geometry and focus on tropicalization via bend relations as a construction in commutative and non-commutative algebra. Constructions such as symmetric algebras, exterior algebras, matrix algebras, and Clifford algebras can be tropicalized. In the case of exterior algebras, the resulting tropical notion beautifully completes the picture of the Pl\"{u}cker embedding and gives a new perspective on the tropical Pl\"{u}cker relations. For matrix algebras and Clifford algebras, Morita theory becomes an interesting topic.</description>

      <title>Random Domino Tilings and the Arctic Circle Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9801068</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/9801068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study domino tilings of a family of finite regions called Aztec diamonds. Every such tiling determines a partition of the Aztec diamond into five sub-regions; in the four outer sub-regions, every tile lines up with nearby tiles, while in the fifth, central sub-region, differently-oriented tiles co-exist side by side. We show that when n is sufficiently large, the shape of the central sub-region becomes arbitrarily close to a perfect circle of radius n/sqrt(2) for all but a negligible proportion of the tilings. Our proof uses techniques from the theory of interacting particle systems. In particular, we prove and make use of a classification of the stationary behaviors of a totally asymmetric one-dimensional exclusion process in discrete time.</description>

      <title>Effects of Backtracking on PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider three variations on standard PageRank: Non-backtracking PageRank, $\mu$-PageRank, and $\infty$-PageRank, all of which alter the standard formula by adjusting the likelihood of backtracking in the algorithm's random walk. We show that in the case of regular and bipartite biregular graphs, standard PageRank and its variants are equivalent. We also compare each centrality measure and investigate their clustering capabilities.</description>

      <title>Alcove walk models for parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections and branching to Levi subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes alcove walk models for intersections of Schubert varieties and partially semi-infinite orbits in the affine Grassmannian of a split reductive group (we call such intersections parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections). More precisely, we describe explicit cellular pavings of these intersections, indexed by certain positively-folded alcove walks. We prove a parametrization of the irreducible components of maximal possible dimension, in terms of alcove walks of maximal possible dimension. We then deduce a new combinatorial description of branching to Levi subgroups of irreducible highest weight representations, and in particular we give a new algorithm for computing the characters of such representations.</description>

      <title>Paths, Ends and The Separation Problem for Infinite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the Separation Problem for infinite graphs, which involves determining whether a connected graph splits into at least two infinite connected components after the removal of a given finite set of edges. We prove that this problem is decidable for every highly computable graph with finitely many ends. Using this result, we demonstrate that K\"onig's Infinity Lemma is effective for such graphs. We also apply it to analyze the complexity of the Eulerian Path Problem for infinite graphs, showing that much of its complexity arises from counting ends. Indeed, the Eulerian Path Problem becomes strictly easier when restricted to graphs with a fixed number of ends. Under this restriction, we provide a complete characterization of the problem. Finally, we study the Separation Problem in a uniform setting (i.e., where the graph is also part of the input) and offer a nearly complete characterization of its complexity and its relationship to counting the number of ends.</description>

      <title>A family of polynomials and related congruences and series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02767v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a family of polynomials $$S_n^{(m)}(x):=\sum_{i,j=0}^n\binom ni^m\binom nj^m\binom{i+j}ix^{i+j}\ \ (m,n=0,1,2,\ldots).$$ For example, we show that $$\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}S_k^{(0)}(x)\equiv\frac x{2x-1}\left(1+\left(\frac{1-4x^2}p\right)\right)\pmod p $$ for any odd prime $p$ and integer $x\not\equiv1/2\pmod p$, where $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ denotes the Legendre symbol.
  We also formulate some open conjectures on related congruences and series for $1/\pi$. For example, we conjecture that $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(7k+1)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/11)}{9^k}=\frac{5445}{104\sqrt{39}\,\pi}$$ and $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(1365k+181)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/18)}{16^k}=\frac{1377}{\sqrt2\,\pi}.$$</description>

      <title>Spectra of high-dimensional sparse random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of the high-dimensional random geometric graph $G(n, d, p)$, formed by sampling $n$ i.i.d vectors $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ uniformly on a $d$-dimensional unit sphere and connecting each pair $\{i,j\}$ whenever $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle \geq \tau$ so that $p=\mathbb P(\langle v_i,v_j\rangle \geq \tau)$. This model defines a nonlinear random matrix ensemble with dependent entries. We show that if $d =\omega( np\log^{2}(1/p))$ and $np\to\infty$, the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized adjacency matrix $\frac{A}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$ is the semicircle law. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for $G(n, d, p)$ in the sparse regime. In the constant sparsity case $p=\alpha/n$, we further show that if $d=\omega(\log^2(n))$ the limiting spectral distribution of $A$ in $G(n,\alpha/n)$ coincides with that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $G(n,\alpha/n)$.
  Our approach combines the classical moment method in random matrix theory with a novel recursive decomposition of closed-walk graphs, leveraging block-cut trees and ear decompositions, to control the moments of the empirical spectral distribution. A refined high trace analysis further yields a near-optimal bound on the second eigenvalue when $np=\Omega(\log^4 (n))$, removing technical conditions previously imposed in (Liu et al. 2023). As an application, we demonstrate that this improved eigenvalue bound sharpens the parameter requirements on $d$ and $p$ for spontaneous synchronization on random geometric graphs in (Abdalla et al. 2024) under the homogeneous Kuramoto model.</description>

      <title>The hereditariness problem for the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the lifting problem for the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture: namely, whether the validity of the conjecture for a quotient automaton can always be transferred (or "lifted") to the original automaton. Although a complete solution remains open, we show that it is sufficient to verify the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture for three specific subclasses of reset automata: radical, simple, and quasi-simple. Our approach relies on establishing a Galois connection between the lattices of congruences and ideals of the transition monoid. This connection not only serves as the main tool in our proofs but also provides a systematic method for computing the radical ideal and for deriving structural insights about these classes. In particular, we show that for every simple or quasi-simple automaton $\mathcal{A}$, the transition monoid $\text{M}(\mathcal{A})$ possesses a unique ideal covering the minimal ideal of constant (reset) maps; a result of similar flavor holds for the class of radical automata.</description>

      <title>Linear identities for partition pairs with $4$-cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine an infinite family of linear identities for the number $A_4(n)$ of partition pairs of $n$ with $4$-cores by employing elementary $q$-series techniques and certain $3$-dissection formulas. We then discover an infinite family of congruences for $A_4(n)$ as a consequence of these linear identities.</description>
