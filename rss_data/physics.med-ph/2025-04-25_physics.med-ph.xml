      <title>Invasion depth estimation of gastric cancer in early stage using circularly polarized light scattering: Phantom studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depolarization of circularly polarized light due to multiple scattering in turbid media provides size distributions of scatterer. Applied it to the biological tissues as turbid media, scatters correspond to cell nuclei, which is abnormally grown in cancerous tissues. Therefore, the invasion depth of early-staged cancer can be estimated by comparisons of circular polarization of scattered light. In this study, we fabricated the optical phantoms made of resin and polystyrene beads to verify this technique by systematic experiments. The single-layered phantoms containing only one size of beads exhibits uniform monodispersed scattering media. Polarization images taken by a circular polarization imaging camera show systematically changes to the numerical density of scatters. Healthy and cancerous tissue phantoms exhibiting the lengths of mean free paths close to actual biological tissues were stacked to be bi-layered phantoms which imitates early-staged cancers. The averaged circular polarization values obtained from the images captured with the polarization camera are indicative of obvious changes depending on the thickness of cancerous layer of phantoms.</description>

      <title>Effect of Electrode Array Position on Electric Field Intensity in Glioblastoma Patients Undergoing Electric Field Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The intensity of the electric field applied to a brain tumor by electric field therapy is influenced by the position of the electrode array, which should be optimized based on the patient's head shape and tumor characteristics. This study assessed the effects of varying electrode positions on electric field intensity in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.
  Methods: This study enrolled 13 GBM patients. The center of the MR slice corresponding to the center of the tumor was set as the reference point for the electrodes, creating pairs of electrode arrays in the top-rear and left-right positions. Based on this reference plan, four additional treatment plans were generated by rotating three of the four electrode arrays, all except the top electrode array, by 15$^\circ$ and 30$^\circ$ from their reference positions, resulting in a total of five treatment plans per patient. Electric field frequency was set at 200 kHz, and current density at 31 mArms/cm$^2$. The minimum and mean electric field intensities, homogeneity index (HI), and coverage index (CovI) were calculated and compared.
  Results: The optimal plans showed differences ranging from-0.39% to 24.20% for minimum intensity and -14.29% to 16.67% for mean intensity compared to reference plans. HI and CovI varied from 0.00% to 48.65% and 0.00% to 95.3%, respectively. The average improvements across all patients were 8.96% for minimum intensity, 5.11% for mean intensity, 15.65% for HI, and 17.84% for CovI.
  Conclusions: Optimizing electrode angle improves electric field therapy outcomes in GBM patients by maximizing field intensity and coverage. Keywords: electric field therapy; glioblastoma multiforme (GBM); treatment planning system (TPS); electrode array position; tumor coverage</description>

      <title>Ultrafast ultrasound coded vector Doppler imaging of blood flow velocity and resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic and precise measurement of cerebral blood flow velocity is crucial in neuroscience and the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Traditional color Doppler ultrasound can only measure the velocity component along the ultrasound beam, which restricts its ability to accurately capture the complete blood flow vector in complex environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ultrafast pulse-coded vector Doppler (PC-UVD) imaging method, utilizing Hadamard matrix-based pulse encoding to improve velocity estimation accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Our study encompasses spiral flow simulations and in vivo rat brain experiments, showing significantly enhanced measurement precision compared to conventional ultrafast vector Doppler (UVD). This innovative approach enables the measurement of dynamic cerebral blood flow velocity within a single cardiac cycle, offering insights into the characteristics of cerebrovascular resistivity. The proposed PC-UVD method employs Hadamard matrix encoding of plane waves, boosting SNR without compromising temporal or spatial resolution. Velocity vectors are subsequently estimated using a weighted least squares (WLS) approach, with iterative residual-based weight optimization improving robustness to noise and minimizing the impact of outliers. The effectiveness of this technique is confirmed through simulations with a spiral blood flow phantom, demonstrating a marked improvement in velocity estimation accuracy, particularly in deep imaging regions with significant signal attenuation. In vivo experiments on rat brains further confirm that the proposed method offers greater accuracy than existing UVD approaches, particularly for small vessels. Notably, our method can precisely differentiate arterial from venous flow by analyzing pulsatility and resistivity within the cerebral vascular network.</description>

      <title>Anatomy-constrained modelling of image-derived input functions in dynamic PET using multi-organ segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate kinetic analysis of [$^{18}$F]FDG distribution in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) requires anatomically constrained modelling of image-derived input functions (IDIFs). Traditionally, IDIFs are obtained from the aorta, neglecting anatomical variations and complex vascular contributions. This study proposes a multi-organ segmentation-based approach that integrates IDIFs from the aorta, portal vein, pulmonary artery, and ureters. Using high-resolution CT segmentations of the liver, lungs, kidneys, and bladder, we incorporate organ-specific blood supply sources to improve kinetic modelling. Our method was evaluated on dynamic [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data from nine patients, resulting in a mean squared error (MSE) reduction of $13.39\%$ for the liver and $10.42\%$ for the lungs. These initial results highlight the potential of multiple IDIFs in improving anatomical modelling and fully leveraging dynamic PET imaging. This approach could facilitate the integration of tracer kinetic modelling into clinical routine.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Glucose Enhanced Imaging using Direct Water Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Dynamic glucose enhanced (DGE) MRI studies employ chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) or spin lock (CESL) to study glucose uptake. Currently, these methods are hampered by low effect size and sensitivity to motion. To overcome this, we propose to utilize exchange-based linewidth (LW) broadening of the direct water saturation (DS) curve of the water saturation spectrum (Z-spectrum) during and after glucose infusion (DS-DGE MRI). Methods: To estimate the glucose-infusion-induced LW changes ($\Delta$LW), Bloch-McConnell simulations were performed for normoglycemia and hyperglycemia in blood, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), CSF, and malignant tumor tissue. Whole-brain DS-DGE imaging was implemented at 3 tesla using dynamic Z-spectral acquisitions (1.2 s per offset frequency, 38 s per spectrum) and assessed on four brain tumor patients using infusion of 35 g of D-glucose. To assess $\Delta$LW, a deep learning-based Lorentzian fitting approach was employed on voxel-based DS spectra acquired before, during, and post-infusion. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) images, obtained from the dynamic $\Delta$LW time curves, were compared qualitatively to perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI). Results: In simulations, $\Delta$LW was 1.3%, 0.30%, 0.29/0.34%, 7.5%, and 13% in arterial blood, venous blood, GM/WM, malignant tumor tissue, and CSF, respectively. In vivo, $\Delta$LW was approximately 1% in GM/WM, 5-20% for different tumor types, and 40% in CSF. The resulting DS-DGE AUC maps clearly outlined lesion areas. Conclusions: DS-DGE MRI is highly promising for assessing D-glucose uptake. Initial results in brain tumor patients show high-quality AUC maps of glucose-induced line broadening and DGE-based lesion enhancement similar and/or complementary to PWI.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of CT-to-RED Calibration Curves on Dosimetric Accuracy in Brain Radiotherapy Dose Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate dose calculation is crucial in radiotherapy, as tissue relative electron densities (RED) derived from CT scans play a vital role. This study investigated the impact of different CT-to-RED calibration curves on brain cancer treatment plans. Three calibration curves were compared: CIRS phantom-derived, Catphan phantom-derived, and the default curve in the Monaco Treatment Planning System. Ten volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were generated and recalculated using each curve. Dosimetric parameters for Planning Target Volume (PTV) and Organs at Risk (OARs) were analyzed. Results showed significant differences in PTV dose distribution between the CIRS-derived and default curves, while no significant differences were found between Catphan-derived and default curves. The CIRS-derived curve demonstrated superior performance in representing brain tissue electron densities. These findings emphasize the importance of using site-specific CT-to-RED calibration curves for accurate dose calculations in brain radiotherapy, potentially improving treatment safety and efficacy</description>
