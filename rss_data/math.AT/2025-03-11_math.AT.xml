      <title>Lifting category, Sectional category, Homotopic distance, All at once</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The `sectional category' of a map has been studied in two ways: on the one hand with open covers, and on the other hand with Ganea and Whitehead style constructions. For these approaches to be equivalent, the normality of the codomain is necessary. We show that this is the only condition. The `Lusternik-Schnirelmann category' of a space, as well as Farber's `topological complexity', are particular cases of sectional categories. In addition, Mac\'ias-Virg\'os and Mosquera-Lois introduced the notion of `homotopic distance' between two maps, showing that it is a distance on the homotopy class of maps with same domain and codomain provided the domain is normal. We introduce the notion of `lifting category' which unifies the notions of sectional category, topological complexity, and homotopic distance, all these notions being special cases of lifting category. A special attention is also paid to the difference between the pointed and unpointed cases.</description>

      <title>A note on relative Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of smooth vector fields on $S^d$ relative to $\mathrm{SO}(d+1)$ following a method by Haefliger that uses tools from rational homotopy theory. In particular, we show that $H^*(\mathrm{BSO}(4);\mathbb{R})$ injects into the relative Gelfand-Fuks cohomology which corrects a claim by Haefliger. Moreover, for $S^3$ the relative Gelfand-Fuks cohomology agrees with the smooth cohomology of $\text{Diff}^+(S^3)$ and we provide a computation in low degrees.</description>

      <title>Representing two-parameter persistence modules via graphcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphcodes were recently introduced as a technique to employ two-parameter persistence modules in machine learning tasks (Kerber and Russold, NeurIPS 2024). We show in this work that a compressed version of graphcodes yields a description of a two-parameter module that is equivalent to a presentation of the module. This alternative representation as a graph allows for a simple translation between combinatorics and algebra: connected components of the graphcode correspond to summands of the module and isolated paths correspond to intervals. We demonstrate that graphcodes are useful in practice by speeding-up the task of decomposing a module into indecomposable summands. Also, the graphcode viewpoint allows to devise a simple algorithm to decide whether a persistence module is interval-decomposable in $O(n^4)$ time, which improves on the previous bound of $O(n^{2\omega+1})$.</description>

      <title>Eulerian magnitude homology: diagonality, injective words, and regular path homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the algebraic structure and combinatorial properties of eulerian magnitude homology. First, we analyze the diagonality conditions of eulerian magnitude homology, providing a characterization of complete graphs. Then, we construct the regular magnitude-path spectral sequence as the spectral sequence of the (filtered) injective nerve of the reachability category, and explore its consequences. Among others, we show that such spectral sequence converges to the complex of injective words on a digraph, and yields characterization results for the regular path homology of diagonal directed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a work of Fu-So-Song, we associate a symmetric matrix $A$ to a plane vector sequence $v$ and give a formula to find the signature of $A$ in terms of the sequence $v$. When $A$ is nonsingular, we interpret the relation between $A$ and $A^{-1}$ from a topological viewpoint. Finally, we associate an omnioriented quasitoric orbifold $X$ of real dimension four to the sequence $v$ and show that $A^{-1}$ is the intersection matrix of the characteristic suborbifolds of $X$.</description>

      <title>Morse theory of loop spaces and Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth closed $n$-manifold $M$ and a $\kappa$-tuple of basepoints $\boldsymbol{q}\subset M$, we define a Morse-type $A_\infty$-algebra $CM_{-*}(\Omega(M,\boldsymbol{q}))$, called the based multiloop $A_\infty$-algebra, as a graded generalization of the braid skein algebra due to Morton and Samuelson. For example, when $M=T^2$ the braid skein algebra is the Type A double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA). The $A_\infty$-operations couple Morse gradient trees on a based loop space with Chas-Sullivan type string operations. We show that, after a certain "base change", $CM_{-*}(\Omega(M,\boldsymbol{q}))$ is $A_\infty$-equivalent to the wrapped higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer $A_\infty$-algebra of $\kappa$ disjoint cotangent fibers which was studied in the work of Honda, Colin, and Tian. We also compute the based multiloop $A_\infty$-algebra for $M=S^2$, which we can regard as a derived Hecke algebra of the $2$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Derived deformation theory of algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.07255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to develop an explicit derived deformation theory of algebraic structures at a high level of generality, encompassing in a common framework various kinds of algebras (associative, commutative, Poisson...) or bialgebras (associative and coassociative, Lie, Frobenius...), that is algebraic structures parametrized by props. A central aspect is that we define and study moduli spaces of deformations of algebraic structures up to quasi-isomorphisms (and not just isotopies or isomorphisms). To do so, we implement methods coming from derived algebraic geometry, by encapsulating these deformation theories as classifying (pre)stacks with good infinitesimal properties and derived formal geometry, by means of derived formal moduli problems and derived formal groups. In particular, we prove that the Lie algebra describing the deformation theory of an object in a given $\infty$-category of dg algebras can be obtained equivalently as the tangent complex of loops on a derived quotient of this moduli space by the homotopy automorphims of this object. Moreover, we provide explicit formulae for such derived deformation problems of algebraic structures up to quasi-isomorphisms and relate them in a precise way to other standard deformation problems of algebraic structures. This relation is given by a fiber sequence of the associated dg-Lie algebras of their deformation complexes. Our results provide simultaneously a vast generalization of standard deformation theory of algebraic structures which is suitable (and needed) to set up algebraic deformation theory both at the $\infty$-categorical level and at a higher level of generality than algebras over operads. In addition, we study a general criterion to compare formal moduli problems of different algebraic structures and apply our formalism to $E_n$-algebras and bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Homotopy groups and quantitative Sperner-type lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of Sperner's lemma for a triangulation $T$ of $(m+1)$-discs $D$ whose vertices are colored in $n+2$ colors. A proper coloring of $T$ on the boundary of $D$ determines a simplicial mapping $f:S^m \to S^n$ and the element $x=[f]$ in $\pi_m(S^n)$. For any $x$ in this homotopy group we define a non-negative integer $\mu(x)$. For some cases this invariant can be found explicitly. Namely, if $m=n$ then this number is the Brouwer degree of the mapping $f$. For the case $m=3, n=2$ we found a lower bound for $\mu(x)$, where $x$ is the Hopf invariant, and proved that $\mu(1)=\mu(2)=9$.
  The main result of this paper is the theorem that the number of fully colored $n$-simplexes in $T$ is not less than $\mu([f])$. To prove this theorem we use a generalization of Pontryagin's theorem for manifolds with respect to their boundaries.</description>

      <title>Spherical Coordinates from Persistent Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02791v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a method to obtain spherical parameterizations of arbitrary data through the use of persistent cohomology and variational optimization. We begin by computing the second-degree persistent cohomology of the filtered Vietoris-Rips (VR) complex of a data set $X$ and extract a cocycle $\alpha$ from any significant feature. From this cocycle, we define an associated map $\alpha: VR(X) \to S^2$ and use this map as an infeasible initialization for a variational model, which we show has a unique solution (up to rigid motion). We then employ an alternating gradient descent/M\"{o}bius transformation update method to solve the problem and generate a more suitable, i.e., smoother, representative of the homotopy class of $\alpha$, preserving the relevant topological feature. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets to show the efficacy of our proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: We show that the loop space of a moment-angle complex associated to a $2$-dimensional simplicial complex decomposes as a finite type product of spheres, loops on spheres, and certain indecomposable spaces which appear in the loop space decomposition of Moore spaces. We also give conditions on certain subcomplexes under which, localised away from sufficiently many primes, the loop space of a moment-angle complex decomposes as a finite type product of spheres and loops on spheres.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg homology on surface configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00515v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow representations of the classical braid groups, we study the homology of unordered configurations in an orientable genus-$g$ surface with one boundary component, over non-commutative local systems defined from representations of the discrete Heisenberg group. Mapping classes act on the local systems and for a general representation of the Heisenberg group we obtain a representation of the mapping class group that is twisted by this action. For the linearisation of the affine translation action of the Heisenberg group we obtain a genuine, untwisted representation of the mapping class group. In the case of the generic Schr\"odinger representation, by composing with a Stone-von Neumann isomorphism we obtain a projective representation by bounded operators on a Hilbert space, which lifts to a representation of the stably universal central extension of the mapping class group. We also discuss the finite dimensional Schr\"odinger representations, especially in the even case. Based on a natural intersection pairing, we show that our representations preserve a sesquilinear form.</description>
