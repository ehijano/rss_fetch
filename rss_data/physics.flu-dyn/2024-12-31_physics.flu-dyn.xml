      <title>Flow of suspensions in a hydraulic fracture consisting of Herschel-Bulkley fluid and spherical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to develop a model for the flow of suspensions consisting of Herschel-Bulkley fluid mixed with spherical particles. In particular, the focus is to investigate the effect of non- Newtonian rheology of the carrying fluid on the flow behavior of a suspension. Two-dimensional steady flow problem in a vertical channel is considered, in which both the pressure gradient and gravity drive the suspension flow. Dependence of the velocity profile and particle concentration across the channel on the fluid rheology parameters and orientation of the pressure gradient is investigated. It is found that the non-uniform particle distribution in the flow across the channel leads to the non-uniform density of the suspension, which causes sinkage of the denser regions and promotes downward migration of the particles even without slip velocity. Particle and suspension fluxes are calculated for various fluid rheologies and pressure gradient orientations. The effect of slip velocity between the phases is added via filtration term that captures fluid flow once particles reach the maximum concentration and stall, and via the settling term that describes gravitational particle settling.</description>

      <title>Modeling Continuous Spatial-temporal Dynamics of Turbulent Flow with Test-time Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise simulation of turbulent flows holds immense significance across various scientific and engineering domains, including climate science, freshwater science, and energy-efficient manufacturing. Within the realm of simulating turbulent flows, large eddy simulation (LES) has emerged as a prevalent alternative to direct numerical simulation (DNS), offering computational efficiency. However, LES cannot accurately capture the full spectrum of turbulent transport scales and is present only at a lower spatial resolution. Reconstructing high-fidelity DNS data from the lower-resolution LES data is essential for numerous applications, but it poses significant challenges to existing super-resolution techniques, primarily due to the complex spatio-temporal nature of turbulent flows. This paper proposes a novel flow reconstruction approach that leverages physical knowledge to model flow dynamics. Different from traditional super-resolution techniques, the proposed approach uses LES data only in the testing phase through a degradation-based refinement approach to enforce physical constraints and mitigate cumulative reconstruction errors over time. Furthermore, a feature sampling strategy is developed to enable flow data reconstruction across different resolutions. The results on two distinct sets of turbulent flow data indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reconstructing high-resolution DNS data, preserving the inherent physical attributes of flow transport, and achieving DNS reconstruction at different resolutions.</description>

      <title>Current State of Atmospheric Turbulence Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence cascade has been modeled using various methods; the one we have used applies to a more exact representation of turbulence where people use the multifractal representation. The nature of the energy dissipation is usually governed by partial differential equations that have been described, such as Navier-Stokes Equations, although usually in climate modeling, the Kolmogorov turbulence cascading approximation leads towards an isotropic representation. In recent years, Meneveau et al. have proposed to go away from Kolmogorov assumptions and propose multifractal models where we can account for a new anisotropic representation. Our research aims to use Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) from the JHU Turbulence Database and Large Eddy Simulations (LES) we simulated using OpenFOAM to predict how accurate these simulations are in replicating Meneveau experimental procedures with numerical simulations using the same rigorous mathematical approaches. Modeling turbulence cascading using higher fidelity data will advance the field and produce faster and better remote sensing metrics. We have written computer code to analyze DNS and LES data and study the multifractal nature of energy dissipation. The box-counting method is used to identify the multifractal dimension spectrum of the DNS and LES data in every direction to follow Meneveau work to represent turbulence-cascading effects in the atmosphere better.</description>

      <title>Reacting Hydrogen Jet in Crossflow - Flame Dynamics Under Acoustic Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents experimental study of reacting hydrogen jet in crossflow. High speed shadowgraph images are used to capture flame dynamics. Unforced jets with various momentum flux ratios (q) are studied. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) analysis is used to examine the high-speed instantaneous images and characterize spatio-temporal behavior the reacting jets. Further, jet is acoustically forced with various frequencies and the effect of forcing frequency and momentum flux ratio is studied in detail. Instantaneous images, POD mode shapes and Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots are used to assess the response of jet to forcing function, and the influence of crossflow. It is observed that the jet does not equally respond to all frequencies and the preferred frequency range is identified. It is also observed that higher momentum ratio produces stronger interaction with the crossflow which dampens the effect of forcing.</description>

      <title>The destabilising effect of particle concentration in inclined settlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water scarcity has required constant water recycling, leading to a decline in water quality, further exacerbated by high concentrations of fine particles that reduce the efficiency of solid-liquid separation systems. Inclined settlers offer a viable secondary treatment option for high-turbidity water. Effective design requires understanding of operational conditions, geometry, and suspension properties. Using OpenFOAM, CFD simulations were performed for a continuous inclined countercurrent conduit to assess the influence of inlet particle concentration on efficiency, exploring various Surface Overflow Rates (SOR) and inclination angles. The results show that the steady state in which the flow settles is strongly dependent on the particle concentration. For very low particle concentrations, the flow is mostly stationary with little to no resuspension of particles. Increasingly unstable regimes are observed to emerge as the inlet concentration increases, leading to increased particle resuspension. Instabilities arise from overhanging zones at the tip of the suspension, generating recirculation zones that enlarge the resuspension region and induce entrainment within the bulk suspension. Shear instabilities become noticeable at large particle concentrations, further increasing resuspension. Different regimes were identified, influenced by the SOR and the inclination angles. Additionally, a Reynolds number characterizing these systems is proposed alongside a scale analysis. The findings highlight particle concentration as a critical parameter in inclined plate settler design.</description>

      <title>A theoretical study of the upper bound of surface elevation variance in the Phillips initial stage during wind-wave generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonance mechanism in the initial stage of wind-wave generation proposed by Phillips (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 2, 1957, 417$\unicode{x2013}$445) is a foundation of wind-wave generation theory, but a precise theoretical quantification of wave energy growth in this initial stage has not been obtained yet after more than six decades of research. In this study, we aim to address this knowledge gap by developing an analytical approach based on a novel complex analysis method to theoretically investigate the temporal evolution of the wave energy in the Phillips initial stage. We quantitatively derive and analyse the growth behaviour of the surface wave energy and obtain an analytical solution for its upper bound. Our result highlights the crucial effects of surface tension. Because the phase velocity of gravity$\unicode{x2013}$capillary waves has a minimal value at a critical wavenumber, gravity$\unicode{x2013}$capillary waves and gravity waves (which neglect surface tension) exhibit distinct resonance curve properties and wave energy growth behaviours. For gravity waves, the resonance curve extends indefinitely; for gravity$\unicode{x2013}$capillary waves, it either forms a finite-length curve or does not exist, depending on the wind speed. The leading-order term of the upper-bound solution of the energy of gravity waves increases linearly over time, while for gravity$\unicode{x2013}$capillary waves, the term increases linearly over time under strong wind conditions but remains finite under weak wind conditions. This theoretical study provides an analytical framework for the generation of wind-waves in the Phillips initial stage, which may inspire further theoretical, numerical, and experimental research.</description>

      <title>2D Internal Gravity Wave Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using weak wave turbulence theory analysis, we distinguish three main regimes for 2D stratified fluids in the dimensionless parameter space defined by the Froude number and the Reynolds number: discrete wave turbulence, weak wave turbulence, and strong nonlinear interaction. These regimes are investigated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the 2D Boussinesq equations with shear modes removed. In the weak wave turbulence regime, excluding slow frequencies, we observe a spectrum that aligns with recent predictions from kinetic theory. This finding represents the first DNS-based confirmation of wave turbulence theory for internal gravity waves. At strong stratification, in both the weak and strong interaction regimes, we observe the formation of layers accompanied by spectral peaks at low discrete frequencies. We explain this layering through an inverse kinetic energy cascade and the discreteness of wave-wave interactions at large scales. This analysis allows us to predict the layer thickness and typical flow velocity in terms of the control parameters.</description>

      <title>Air entrainment and gas transfer processes in wave breaking events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gas transfer processes occurring at the air-water interface of progressive water waves using high-fidelity numerical simulations. Waves with varying initial steepness, including regular wave patterns, mild spilling and intense plunging breakers are examined. A multiphase solver is employed to model gas flux and diffusion processes enabling precise estimation of the air-water interface area and gas transfer velocity, achieving an accuracy unattainable in experiments. We reveal that the volume of gas transferred across the air-water interface increases significantly with the amount of air entrained due to wave breaking, peak values in the gas transfer velocity being concurrent with peaks in energy dissipation rate and air entrainment. Furthermore, the gas transfer velocity is observed to scale approximately as the one-fourth power of the energy dissipation rate, consistent with previous theoretical predictions. We anticipate that the present findings can help reduce the substantial uncertainty associated with parameterizing fundamental natural processes, such as CO2 absorption by the oceans.</description>

      <title>Level crossing instabilities in inviscid isothermal compressible Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of inviscid steady parallel flow of an ideal gas in a channel of finite width. Compressible isothermal two-dimensional monochromatic perturbations are considered. The eigenvalue problem governing density and velocity perturbations is a compressible version of Rayleigh's equation and involves two parameters: a flow Mach number $M$ and the perturbation wavenumber $k$. For an odd background velocity profile, there is a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and growth rates $\gamma$ come in symmetrically placed 4-tuples in the complex eigenplane. Specializing to uniform background vorticity Couette flow, we find an infinite tower of noninflectional eigenmodes and derive stability theorems and bounds on growth rates. We show that eigenmodes are neutrally stable for small $k$ and small $M$ but that they otherwise display an infinite sequence of stability transitions with increasing $k$ or $M$. Using a search algorithm based on the Fredholm alternative, we find that the transitions are associated to level crossings between neighboring eigenmodes. Repeated level crossings result in windows of instability. For a given eigenmode, they are arranged in a zebra-like striped pattern on the $k$-$M$ plane. A canonical square-root power law form for $\gamma(k,M)$ in the vicinity of a stability transition is identified. In addition to the discrete spectrum, we find a continuous spectrum of eigenmodes that are always neutrally stable but fail to be smooth across critical layers.</description>

      <title>Systematic Benchmarking of Macrosegregation: The Performance of a Modified Hybrid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new alloy solidification benchmark, called AFRODITE, with well-defined setups and state-of-the-art measurements has emerged, enabling a thorough assessment of MacroSegregation (MS) solvers, particularly in terms of their ability to predict different features of MS maps. In this research, we first develop an analytical solution for the alloy-solidification Stefan problem, which involves melt, solid, and mushy regions. This new analytical solution extends a previous solution (S. Cho and J. Sunderland, "Heat-conduction problems with melting or freezing", J. Heat Transfer, vol. 91, pp. 421-426, 1969) by incorporating a linear microsegregation law as a function of temperature in place of spatial coordinate. Then, we adopt this solution to verify an OpenFOAM MS solver in a limiting condition, where only heat diffusion is present. Subsequently, to capture the MS map of the Sn-3%Pb AFRODITE benchmark, the solver is incorporated using the standard Blake-Kozeny-Carman permeability law and one of its hybrid variants, slightly modified in this work to better align with physics by ensuring a continuous transition of characteristics from the slurry to the porous regions of the mush. It is demonstrated that the hybrid model predicts the main features of the MS map, including the channel segregates morphology and peak segregation degree due to the pile-up effect, in much finer agreement with the experimental observation. Careful analyses of the results reveal that these improved predictions stem from the hybrid model's more accurate estimation of the re-melting, melt flow advection parallel, and advection normal to the solidification front.</description>

      <title>Derivation of an Analytical Solution of a Forced Cantilevered Tube Conveying Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to obtain the forced response of a cantilevered tube conveying fluid. By considering the pipe subjected to an arbitrary harmonic force, either distributed or concentrated, an analytical solution is found using the Green's function method. The closed-form solution obtained satisfies the differential equations governing the vibrating tube conveying fluid. The proposed method, which provides exact solutions, is more accurate than the classical eigenfunction expansion or Galerkin's method and eliminates the need for eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, or infinite series.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Scattering, Emergent Interactions of Solitons in the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation through Conservative and non-Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study collision process of soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. The Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation originally was the model in three dimensions of plasma with a uniform magnetic field and it is a direct extension of the KdV equation into higher dimensions and is a typical quasi-integrable system. PINNs successfully solve the equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper form of the equation can be successfully derived from a given training data. On the other hand, the situation becomes weird in the collision process. The result in the forward analysis no longer possesses the conservation laws, which is ought to be referred to as a dynamically incompatible field configuration (DIFC) instead of the solutions of the system. Conservative PINNs are thus introduced and we succeed to obtain the solutions that satisfy the conservation laws. The inverse analysis suggests a different equation where the coefficients exhibit the significant changes, which implies an emergent temporal interaction. With these modulated coefficients, we recalculate the equation and confirm that the conservation law has unquestionably improved.</description>

      <title>Preventing sinking of a disk by leveraging the boundary jump phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is commonly expected that a metal disk placed on the surface of water will sink, our investigation has revealed a surprising phenomenon: a vertical jet directed onto the disk from above can allow it to remain afloat. This result defies intuition, as one would assume that the force of the jet's impact would cause the disk to sink. We have discovered that this phenomenon occurs as a result of water displacement from the top of the disk caused by the impacting jet, operating through a mechanism similar to the hydraulic jump. This displacement generates a difference in hydrostatic pressures, resulting in an upward buoyancy force capable of balancing the force of gravity. In contrast to the classical case, here the jump radius is fixed by the geometric parameters of a disk, a phenomenon we refer to as the boundary jump. To further explore this effect, we have presented a theoretical model based on scaling laws, which provides the conditions required for the disk to float. The dimensionless scaling constant's value was determined through an independent experiment. Finally, we conducted experiments on the disk's floating and sinking, which showed a good match with the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Rapidly yawing spheroids in viscous shear flow: Emergent loss of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. We also demonstrate that this effective asymmetry generated by the rapid yawing can cause chaotic behaviour in the emergent dynamics, in stark contrast to the emergent dynamics generated by rapidly rotating spheroids, which are equivalent to those of effective passive spheroids. In general, we find that the shape of the equivalent effective particle under rapid yawing is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. In these scenarios, we calculate analytically the equivalent aspect ratio of the effective spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Active grid turbulence anomalies through the lens of physics informed neural networks</title>

Abstract: Active grids operated with random protocols are a standard way to generate large Reynolds number turbulence in wind and water tunnels. But anomalies in the decay and third-order scaling of active-grid turbulence have been reported. We combine Laser Doppler Velocimetry and hot-wire anemometry measurements in a wind tunnel, with machine learning techniques and numerical simulations, to gain further understanding on the reasons behind these anomalies. Numerical simulations that incorporate the statistical anomalies observed in the experimental velocity field near the active grid can reproduce the experimental anomalies observed later in the decay. The results indicate that anomalies in experiments near the active grid introduce correlations in the flow that can persist for long times.</description>

      <title>Computational Investigation of Roughness Effects on Boundary Layer Transition for Stetson's Blunt Cone at Mach 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00228</link>

Abstract: In this aerothermal study, we performed a two-dimensional steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and heat conduction simulation at Mach 6. The key to our methodology was a one-way coupling between CFD surface temperature as a boundary condition and the calculation of the heat transfer flux and temperatures inside the solid stainless-steel body of a nose geometry. This approach allowed us to gain insight into surface heat transfer signatures with corresponding fluid flow regimes, such as the one experienced in laminar fluid flow. We have also examined this heat transfer under roughness values encountered in Stetson's studies at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Ludwig tube. To validate our findings, we have performed this type of work on a blunt cone, specifically for the U.S. Air Force.</description>

      <title>Momentum fluxes in wind-forced breaking waves</title>

Abstract: We investigate the momentum fluxes between a turbulent air boundary layer and a growing-breaking wave field by solving the air-water two-phase Navier-Stokes equations through direct numerical simulations (DNS). A fully-developed turbulent airflow drives the growth of a narrowbanded wave field, whose amplitude increases until reaching breaking conditions. The breaking events result in a loss of wave energy, transferred to the water column, followed by renewed growth under wind forcing. We revisit the momentum flux analysis in a high-wind speed regime, characterized by the ratio of the friction velocity to wave speed $u_\ast/c$ in the range $[0.3-0.9]$, through the lens of growing-breaking cycles. The total momentum flux across the interface is dominated by pressure, which increases with $u_\ast/c$ during growth and reduces sharply during breaking. Drag reduction during breaking is linked to airflow separation, a sudden acceleration of the flow, an upward shift of the mean streamwise velocity profile, and a reduction in Reynolds shear stress. We characterize the reduction of pressure stress and flow acceleration through an aerodynamic drag coefficient by splitting the analysis between growing and breaking stages, treating them as separate sub-processes. While drag increases with $u_\ast/c$ during growth, it drops during breaking. Averaging over both stages leads to a saturation of the drag coefficient at high $u_\ast/c$, comparable to what is observed at high wind speeds in laboratory and field conditions. Our analysis suggests this saturation is controlled by breaking dynamics.</description>

      <title>Improved Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics with Application to Fluid Flows</title>

Abstract: Model reduction is a key technology for large-scale physical systems in science and engineering, as it brings behavior expressed in many degrees of freedom to a more manageable size that subsequently allows control, optimization, and analysis with multi-query algorithms. We introduce an enhanced regression technique tailored to uncover quadratic parametric reduced-order dynamical systems from data. Our method, termed Improved Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics (I-GILD), refines the learning phase of the original GILD approach. This refinement is achieved by reorganizing the quadratic model coefficients, allowing the minimum-residual problem to be reformulated using the Frobenius norm. Consequently, the optimality conditions lead to a generalized Sylvester equation, which is efficiently solved using the conjugate gradient method. Analysis of the convergence shows that I-GILD achieves superior convergence for quadratic model coefficients compared to GILD's steepest gradient descent, reducing both computational complexity and iteration count. Additionally, we derive an error bound for the model predictions, offering insights into error growth in time and ensuring controlled accuracy as long as the magnitudes of initial error is small and learning residuals are well minimized. The efficacy of I-GILD is demonstrated through its application to numerical and experimental tests, specifically the flow past Ahmed body with a variable rear slant angle, and the lid-driven cylindrical cavity problem with variable Reynolds numbers, utilizing particle-image velocimetry (PIV) data. These tests confirm I-GILD's ability to treat real-world dynamical system challenges and produce effective reduced-order models.</description>

      <title>Effect of time-dependent sinusoidal electric field on the onset of electroconvection in a viscoelastic fluid layer</title>

Abstract: Time-periodic electric field modulation of a viscoelastic dielectric fluid layer heated from below and cooled from above is examined using an Oldroyd-B type liquid. On the basis of small amplitudes of modulation, the regular perturbation method can be used to calculate the threshold for correction of the critical Rayleigh number. The dielectric constant is assumed to be a linear function of temperature. We show that electric field modulation frequency, electrical, Prandtl number, and viscoelastic parameters are related to the shift in the critical Rayleigh number and the possibility of subcritical convection for low-frequency modulation of the electric field. Rayleigh number, wavenumber, and frequency stability are determined based on free-free isothermal boundary conditions. The dielectrophoretic force is only destabilizing when an electrical field is modulated at a low frequency because it is associated with an unmodulated layer of dielectric fluid. As a result of the stress relaxation parameter in a sinusoidal electric field, the system is destabilized at low frequencies and stabilized at moderate and high frequencies. The effect of strain retardation on mechanical anisotropy is completely opposite. The stability characteristics are illustrated through graphs showing the numerical values of parameters.</description>

      <title>A multiple-circuit approach to quantum resource reduction with application to the quantum lattice Boltzmann method</title>

Abstract: This work proposes a multi-circuit quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) algorithm that leverages parallel quantum computing to reduce quantum resource requirements. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient for these computations. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems are based on single quantum circuits and, in many cases, use lattice-based methods. Current quantum devices are adorned with sufficient noise to make large and deep circuits untenable. We introduce a multiple-circuit algorithm for a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) solve of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The method, called QLBM-frugal, aims to create more practical quantum circuits and strategies for differential equation-based problems. The presented method is validated and demonstrated for 2D lid-driven cavity flow. The two-circuit algorithm shows a marked reduction in CNOT gates, which consume the majority of the runtime on quantum devices. Compared to the baseline QLBM technique, a two-circuit strategy shows increasingly large improvements in gate counts as the qubit size, or problem size, increases. For 64 lattice sites, the CNOT count was reduced by 35%, and the gate depth decreased by 16%. This strategy also enables concurrent circuit execution, further halving the seen gate depth.</description>
