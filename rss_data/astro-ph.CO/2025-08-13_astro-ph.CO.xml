      <title>The Compilation and Validation of the Spectroscopic Redshift Catalogs for the DESI-COSMOS and DESI-XMMLSS Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over several dedicated programs that include targets beyond the main cosmological samples, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collected spectra for 311,102 unique objects in two fields centered on the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. In this work, we develop spectroscopic redshift robustness criteria for those spectra, validate these criteria using visual inspection, and provide two custom Value-Added Catalogs with our redshift characterizations. With these criteria, we reliably classify 217,037 galaxies below z &lt; 1.6, 9,688 quasars and 35,505 stars. As a critical element in characterizing the selection function, we provide the description of 70 different algorithms that were used to select these targets from imaging data. To facilitate joint imaging/spectroscopic analyses, we provide row-matched photometry from the Dark Energy Camera, Hyper-Suprime Cam, and public COSMOS2020 photometric catalogs. Finally, we demonstrate example applications of these large catalogs to photometric redshift estimation, cluster finding, and completeness studies.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Models with Gauss-Bonnet Coupling in Light of ACT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data with other cosmological datasets report a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, creating tension with a wide range of inflationary models. Since a Gauss-Bonnet term with a coupling function $\xi(\phi) = 3\lambda/[4V(\phi)]$ leaves $n_s$ nearly unchanged (up to a field rescaling) while reducing the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by a factor $(1-\lambda)$, so choosing $(1-\lambda)$ sufficiently small effectively removes $r$ as a limiting observable, making it easier for inflationary models to satisfy the latest observational constraints and alleviating this tension. Applying this mechanism to chaotic inflation, E-models, T-models, and hilltop inflation, we find that broad regions of parameter space become consistent with the latest ACT-based CMB constraints. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet couplings can help bring a broad class of inflationary models into agreement with current CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>The cosmological lithium problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance in Spite plateau stars has been attributed either to a challenge to the standard model of nucleosynthesis or to stellar processes occurring after the stars formed. To understand the origin of this discrepancy, it is crucial to link the cosmic star formation rate with a chemical enrichment model that incorporates the yields of both Population (Pop) III and II stars. It is within this framework that the evolution of lithium can be determined. The primary goal is to demonstrate that there is no discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance. By combining a standard chemical evolution model with the hierarchical structure formation scenario, it is possible to determine the lithium abundance as a function of $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. The model's results are compared with observational data, including two extremely iron-poor stars: J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708. The Spite plateau is naturally established in the range $-8.0 \lesssim [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \lesssim -2.0$ with $^{7}\mathrm{Li/H}$ $\sim 1.81 \times 10^{-10}$. We find that J0023+0307 could have formed $\sim 4.4 \times 10^{5} - 1.3 \times 10^{6}$ years after the explosion of the first Pop III star in the Universe, whereas for SMSS J0313-6708 this event would have occurred $\sim 2.2 \times 10^{5} - 4.4 \times 10^{5}$ years later. The Spite plateau serves as an observational signature of the formation of Pop III stars. The abundances observed in J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708 are consistent with Pop III progenitor stars in the mass range $10-100 M_{\odot}$. However, if some high-redshift star formation occurs within subhalo-like structures, the contribution of stars in the mass range $140-260 M_{\odot}$ to the formation of the extended Spite plateau cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Inflation with Interacting Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful tool to calculate the cosmological correlators non-perturbatively. However, it requires the initial data for the amplitude of the noise on the initial flat hypersurface which for a free theory during inflation is fixed to be $\frac{H}{2 \pi}$. In this work, we study the setups where the underlying theory involves interactions and the stochastic noises inherit these interactions. We extend the stochastic $\delta N$ formalism to these setups and rewrite the corresponding Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations in which the QFT corrections in the amplitude of the noises are taken into account. As an example, in the three-phase SR-USR-SR setup which is employed for PBHs formation, the modification in the amplitude of noise is calculated from the one-loop corrections in power spectrum via in-in formalism. We show that in these setups the amplitude of the stochastic noise is modified to $\frac{H}{2 \pi} \Big(1+ \frac{ \Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{ {\cal R} } }\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ in which $ \frac{\Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{{\cal R} } }$ is the fractional one-loop correction in power spectrum.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a Possible Primordial Black Hole Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW231123, the heaviest binary black hole merger detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration to date, lies in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits unusually high component spins. In this letter, we show that both merging black holes may have a primordial origin with smaller initial masses. The observed masses and, crucially, the spins of GW231123 are naturally accommodated within the most vanilla primordial black hole framework, once cosmological accretion is taken into account. Interestingly, the parameter space needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the exclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this interpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out. The upcoming O5 observing run by the collaboration should detect ${\cal O}(20)$ similar events, testing their mass-spin correlation, while next-generation detectors would be capable of observing high redshift events, as predicted in this scenario.</description>

      <title>A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</description>

      <title>A Promise for the JWST era: Massive black holes directly collapsed from wave dark matter haloes, and Star formation in and around their accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several puzzling phenomena from recent JWST observations, which seem to push the standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology over the edge. All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the "heavy eggs") formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the "chickens"). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely "maximum stable mass" and "bosenova") and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.</description>

      <title>Numerical modelling of the lobes of radio galaxies VI. Polarimetric simulations of universal pressure profile cluster atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a polarization study based upon relativistic magnetohydrodynamic modelling of jets running into hydrostatic, spherically symmetric cluster atmospheres. For the first time in a numerical simulation, we derive Faraday rotation measure maps (RM maps) from model cluster atmospheres based upon the universal pressure profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature profile for a 'typical' self-similar atmosphere described by only one parameter: M500. We compare our simulated polarization products with current observational data from Very Large Array (VLA) and LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR), as well as continuing investigations from our previous work, such as the detectability of the Laing Garrington effect. We also studied the variation of mean fractional polarization with cluster mass and jet power. We produce simulated Stokes Q and U channel images and using the Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis technique we create RM maps. These data provide insight into what we should expect of current and future high-resolution polarimetric studies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows as we were able to probe the limitations of the RM synthesis technique by comparing it with the RM map direct from our simulations. Highlights of our study include clear reproduction of polarization enhancements towards the edges of radio lobes for suitable conditions and a demonstration that complex lobe morphologies with multiple emission and Faraday active regions interspersed as might be expected in some pole-on or perhaps precessing sources should be distinguishable in observations with current technology. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster atmosphere, these numerical simulations, and the polarimetric properties derived from them, represent the most realistic yet for spherically symmetric atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Balmer series fluxes from Pop. III Stars: A-SLOTH Predictions for JWST Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting Population III (Pop. III) stars remains a major observational challenge. Their Balmer series recombination line emission, redshifted into the infrared at $z \sim 5-11$, is a potential tracer. JWST/NIRSpec offers the first opportunity to detect such lines, provided fluxes exceed instrumental sensitivity. This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first four Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess their detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \leq z \leq 11$. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting Milky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted fluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop. III H$\alpha$ fluxes peak at $\sim10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, 2-3 orders of magnitude below the JWST detection threshold ($\sim6 \times 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). The fluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H$\alpha$ and hence are also not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing photon escape fraction $f_{\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop. III Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9 to 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in this case, the lines remain undetectable.
  Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be undetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\mu \gtrsim 10$). A-SLOTH provides a useful tool to predict emission strengths and assess the detectability of Pop. III stars across cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave distance estimation using intrinsic signal properties: dark sirens as distance indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a powerful means for cosmological distance estimation, circumventing the systematic uncertainties associated with traditional electromagnetic (EM) indicators. This work presents a model for estimating distances to binary black hole (BBH) mergers using only GW data, independent of EM counterparts or galaxy catalogs. By utilizing the intrinsic properties of the GW signal, specifically the strain amplitude and merger frequency, our model offers a computationally efficient preliminary distance estimation approach that could complements existing Bayesian parameter estimation pipelines. In this work, we examine a simplified analytical expression for the GW luminosity distance derived from General Relativity (GR), based on the leading-order quadrupole approximation. Without incorporating post-Newtonian (PN) or numerical relativity (NR) corrections, or modeling spin, eccentricity, or inclination, we test how closely this expression can reproduce distances reported by full Bayesian inference pipelines. We apply our model to 87 events from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogues (GWTC), computing distances for these sources. Our results demonstrate consistent agreement with GWTC-reported distances, further supported by graphical comparisons that highlight the model's performance across multiple events.</description>

      <title>Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in the circumgalactic medium -- II: dependence on star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) Effect in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of $\approx$2.5 million $\rm M_{200}$=$\rm 10^{12-14}\,M_\odot$ WISE$\times$DESI galaxies out to $z$=1.2. We split the sample into quiescent (0.7 million) and star-forming (1.8 million) galaxies, exploring the relation between the thermal pressure of the CGM and star formation for the first time. We develop and implement a novel probabilistic approach to cross-correlate the galaxy catalog with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope+Planck data by taking into account the uncertainties in redshift, mass, and star formation rate. The S/N of the stacked Compton-$y$ value in the CGM varies from 4.9 to 18.5, depending on the sample size and the CGM signal strength within the relevant mass bin. We detect the CGM signal down to $\rm M_{200}=10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$, and provide stringent upper limit at $\rm M_{200}&lt;10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$. The data fit well with the standard GNFW profile of thermal pressure and do not require a flatter or steeper profile. This suggests a significant impact of cooling and the absence of dominant feedback. In galaxies with $\rm M_{200}\approx10^{12.3-12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the volume filling CGM is likely the largest contributor to the $galactic$ baryons at their virial temperatures of $\sim$10$^{6-6.4}\rm\,K$. For $\rm M_{200}&gt;10^{12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the most massive phase of the CGM is likely at a sub-virial temperature of $\rm\gtrsim 10^6\,K$. The thermal energy of the CGM of quiescent galaxies follows the self-similar relation with mass, but the star-forming galaxies deviate from this relation. This indicates that the impact of non-gravitational factors varies among halos of different degrees of star-forming activity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a wholly self-consistent, complete cyclic bouncing cosmology based on components drawn from string theory and constructed in a way that is under perturbative control throughout (e.g., with temperature much less than the string scale and string coupling $g_s \ll 1$ at all times). The cyclic evolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a perturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a second field that becomes massless at $\phi= \phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an enhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the way to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs) - fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the string mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the Null Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string coupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In turn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and initiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition into slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic singularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and robustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of primordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of $\mathrm{U(1)_X}$ Breaking and Right-Handed Neutrino Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) leaves several fundamental questions unanswered, including the origin of neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, and the nature of dark matter. Motivated by these gaps, we investigate an extension of the SM with an additional local $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry and a complex scalar singlet that spontaneously breaks this symmetry via its vacuum expectation value. The extended framework naturally accommodates three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to ensure anomaly cancellation and implements a type-I seesaw mechanism for active neutrino masses. We perform a detailed numerical analysis demonstrating consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, including predictions for the effective Majorana mass parameter relevant to neutrinoless double beta decay. Furthermore, we estimate the key parameters of the first-order phase transition and compute the resulting stochastic gravitational wave spectrum, demonstrating that it can lie within the reach of forthcoming experiments such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, and the Einstein Telescope. The right-handed neutrinos also open a viable path for thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified link between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and gravitational wave signatures. Our results demonstrate that this minimal $U(1)_X$ scenario remains a promising probe for physics beyond the Standard Model, accessible through upcoming gravitational wave and neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Powerful Radio Sources as Probes of Black Hole Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powerful jetted radio sources for which the luminosity in directed kinetic energy has been empirically determined, independent of assumptions, are considered. The total outflow lifetime of each source determined in the context of detailed cosmological studies was found to depend only upon the luminosity in directed kinetic energy ($L$). The distributions of $L$, total outflow lifetime, and total outflow energy each have a broad range of values, as do the supermassive black hole masses. The total outflow energy relative to the black hole mass is a small number with a small dispersion. Three explanations of these remarkable results are considered. This could indicate (1) the efficiencies with which black hole irreducible mass is increased and spin mass energy is extracted during the outflow event, (2) that the merger of two supermassive black holes occurs over a timescale commensurate with the independently determined outflow lifetime and that these mergers lead to the production of the low-frequency gravitational wave background, or (3) that feedback shuts off black hole accretion due to energy injected into the ambient medium.</description>

      <title>Bubble Trouble: a Review on Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the universal asymmetry between matter and antimatter remains a mystery. Electroweak baryogenesis is a well-motivated mechanism for generating the asymmetry dynamically, using interesting features of the Standard Model. In addition, it relies on beyond-the-Standard Model physics active around the electroweak scale: new physics coupling to the Higgs to make the electroweak phase transition first order, and a new mechanism of CP violation. The relatively low energy scale at which electroweak baryogenesis occurs makes certain aspects of the mechanism testable through collider experiments, electric dipole moment measurements, and gravitational wave observations. However, scenarios of electroweak baryogenesis are increasingly challenged by results from contemporary experiments. The developing experimental programs will play a crucial role in either falsifying or detecting the new physics responsible for electroweak baryogenesis. To achieve this, it is essential to make precise predictions for the baryon asymmetry and the corresponding experimental signatures within specific scenarios. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the rich physics involved in these predictions. Our goal is to offer a practical computational guide, with a focus on recent developments in the field.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing patchy helium reionization using the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intergalactic helium became fully ionized by the end of cosmic noon ($z\sim2$). Similarly to the reionization of hydrogen, helium reionization is expected to be patchy, driven by luminous quasars that ionize the intergalactic gas in their surrounding environment. Probing the morphology of ionized electrons during this epoch can provide crucial information about early structure formation, including the clustering and luminosities of quasars, the accretion rates, variability, and lifetimes of active galactic nuclei, as well as the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes. In this study, we present how measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be used to reconstruct the optical-depth fluctuations resulting from patchy helium reionization. As helium reionization occurred at lower redshifts, upcoming probes of large-scale structure surveys will present a significant opportunity to enhance the prospects of probing this epoch by their combined analysis with the CMB. Using a joint information-matrix analysis of hydrogen and helium reionization, we show that near-future galaxy and CMB surveys will have enough statistical power to detect optical-depth fluctuations due to doubly-ionized helium, providing a way of measuring the redshift and duration of helium reionization to high significance. We also show that modeling uncertainties in helium reionization can impact the measurement precision of parameters characterizing hydrogen reionization.</description>

      <title>Squeezing information from radio surveys to probe the primordial Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major goal of cosmology is to understand the nature of the field(s) which drove primordial Inflation. Through future observations, the statistics of large-scale structure will allow us to probe primordial non-Gaussianity of the curvature perturbation at the end of Inflation. We show how a new correlation statistic can significantly improve these constraints over conventional methods. Next-generation radio telescope arrays are under construction which will map the density field of neutral hydrogen to high redshifts. These telescopes can operate as an interferometer, able to probe small scales, or as a collection of single dishes, combining signals to map the large scales. We show how to fuse these these operating modes in order to measure the squeezed bispectrum with higher precision and greater economy. This leads to constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity that will improve on measurements by Planck, and out-perform other surveys such as Euclid. We forecast that $\sigma(f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}})\sim 3$, achieved by using a small subset, $\mathcal{O}(10^2-10^3)$, of the total number of accessible triangles. The proposed method can be used for any signal that peaks in squeezed configurations.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Substructure or Source Model Systematics? A Case Study of Cluster Lens Abell S1063</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping the small-scale structure of the universe through gravitational lensing is a promising tool for probing the particle nature of dark matter. Curved Arc Basis (CAB) has been proposed as a local lensing formalism in galaxy clusters, with the potential to detect low-mass dark matter substructure. In this work, we analyze the cluster lens Abell S1063 in search of dark matter substructure with the CAB formalism, using multi-band imaging data from JWST. We use two different source modeling methods: shapelets and pixel-based source reconstruction based on Delaunay triangulation. We find that source modeling systematics from shapelets result in a disagreement between Curved Arc Basis parameters measured from different filters. Source modeling with Delaunay significantly alleviates this systematic, as seen in the improvement in agreement across filters. We also find that inadequate complexity in source modeling can result in convincing spurious detections of dark matter substructure from strong gravitational lenses, as seen by our $\Delta \text{BIC} &gt; 20$ measurement of a $M \sim 10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ subhalo with shapelets, a spurious detection that is not reproduced with Delaunay source modeling. We demonstrate that multi-band analysis with different JWST filters is key for disentangling source and lens model systematics from dark matter substructure detections.</description>

      <title>On DESI's DR2 exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DESI collaboration, combining their Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data with cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and supernovae data, have found significant indication against the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This can also be interpreted as the significance of the detection of the $w_a$ parameter that measures variation of the dark energy equation of state. DESI's DR2 article quotes exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM for combinations of BAO and CMB data with each of three different and overlapping supernovae compilations (at 2.8-sigma for Pantheon+, 3.8-sigma for Union3, and 4.2-sigma for DESY5). We show that one can neither choose amongst nor average over these three different significances. We demonstrate how a principled statistical combination yields a combined exclusion significance of 3.1-sigma. Further we argue that, faced with these competing significances, the most secure inference from the DESI DR2 results is the 3.1-sigma level exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM obtained from combining DESI+CMB alone, omitting supernovae.</description>

      <title>Constraining the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster Abell 2142 using MeerKAT L-band polarisation data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields permeate the Universe, including galaxy clusters, and affect the thermodynamical properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that seed magnetic fields are amplified up to the $\mu$G-level in the ICM, but the magnetic field strength and structure have been studied in only a few clusters. Abell 2142 is a local massive cluster that shows evidence of a post-merger dynamical state. In this work, we aim to constrain the magnetic field intensity, radial profile and power spectrum within its ICM, providing key insights into the nature of this non-thermal component in galaxy clusters. We present MeerKAT observations of Abell 2142 in the L-band (872-1712 MHz), imaged in polarisation for the first time with this purpose. We derive the Rotation Measure (RM) from the radio galaxies' polarised emission by applying the RM synthesis technique and analyse both the RM and fractional polarisation ($\mathrm{F_p}$). To investigate the magnetic field distribution within the ICM, we compare our results with mock RM maps generated from 3D simulations of the cluster. We find that the RM dispersion, $\sigma_{\mathrm{RM}}$, decreases with projected radius, whereas the $\mathrm{F_p}$ increases. Both trends suggest that the magnetic field intensity decreases at larger distances from the cluster center, in agreement with studies on other clusters. Assuming that the magnetic field energy density scales with the gas thermal energy ($B \propto n_e^{0.5}$), a magnetic field with a power spectrum ranging from scales between 7 and 470 kpc, with peak at $\sim 140$ kpc and mean central strength of $9.5 \pm 1.0 \ \mu$G, provides the best fit to our data. The high central magnetic field lies at the upper end of the range observed in other systems and supports the possibility of an hadronic contribution to the diffuse radio emission previously detected at the cluster center.</description>

      <title>Bimetric gravity improves the fit to DESI BAO and eases the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB + SNe Ia, but it exacerbates the Hubble tension. By comparison, bimetric gravity provides a modest improvement in fit quality, at the $1 \, \sigma$ level, but, by inferring $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.4 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, it partially eases the Hubble tension, from a $5 \,\sigma$ discrepancy to a $3.7 \, \sigma$ tension. Including locally calibrated SNe Ia brings the overall preference for the bimetric model over $\Lambda$CDM to the $2 \, \sigma$ level, comparable to that of the $w_0 w_a$CDM model when including the local SN Ia calibration.</description>

      <title>Halo Occupation Distribution of Quasars: Dependence on Luminosity, Redshift, Black Hole Mass and Feedback Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\sim 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function. We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias (a factor of $\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\sim 10-70\%$ in the satellite occupation fraction) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \%$ of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the coupled dynamics between the bubble wall and the plasma from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. The commonly used equation of motion of the bubble wall in the kinetic approach is shown to be incomplete. In the language of the two-particle-irreducible effective action, the conventional equation misses higher-loop terms generated by the condensate-particle type vertices (e.g.,~$\varphi\phi\chi^2$, where $\varphi$ is the background field describing the bubble wall, $\phi$ the corresponding particle excitation and $\chi$ another particle species in the plasma). From the missing terms, we identify an additional dissipative friction which is contributed by particle production processes from the condensate-particle type vertices. We also show how other transmission processes beyond the 1-to-1 elementary transmission studied in the literature for ultrarelativistic bubble walls, e.g., 1-to-1 mixing and 1-to-2 transition radiation, can be understood from the kinetic approach.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons, predicted in scenarios beyond the Standard Model and viable dark matter (DM) candidates, can form superradiant clouds around spinning black holes influencing their dynamics. Using century-long monitored OJ287 supermassive black hole binary we set first DM-independent, dynamical constraints on their masses $\mu = (8.5-22) \times 10^{-22}$ eV. These dynamical constraints, driven by boson cloud friction, are robust against DM-model uncertainties and offer a novel ultralight boson probe. We show that analogous superradiant dynamics across the cosmic population of supermassive black hole systems could help resolve final-parsec evolution stalling problem and imprint a detectable suppression and break in the gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Survey of Transient Lensing Opportunities for Primordial Black Hole Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast range of masses. While past search efforts have focused on particular source classes-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no systematic, multi-wavelength survey has compared their relative potential for PBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the accessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and time-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the PBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths. Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses, planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares). We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational requirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future multi-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and strategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining viable parameter space.</description>
