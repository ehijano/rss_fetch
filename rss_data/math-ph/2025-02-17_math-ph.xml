Abstract: Scale invariant scattering suggests that all Bernoulli numbers B_{2n} can be naturally partitioned, i.e., written as particular finite sums of same-signed, monotonic, rational numbers. Some properties of these rational numbers are discussed here, especially in the limit of large n.</description>

      <title>Lessons from gauge fixing and polymerization of loop quantum black holes with a cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop quantization of Schwarzschild black holes with a cosmological constant for polymerization parameters which are constant is studied in the effective spacetime description. We show that for the positive cosmological constant there can be an appearance of large quantum effects at small spacetime curvatures. These effects can manifest as an additional black hole horizon. While the central singularity is resolved in all the cases, these limitations demonstrate incompatibility of the Kantowski-Sachs gauge and schemes with fixed polymerization parameters in the presence of a positive cosmological constant. In contrast, the case of a negative cosmological constant is free of such problematic features. Noted limitations are similar to those in the $\mu_o$ scheme for the loop quantization of cosmological models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in Quantum Field Theory, focusing on a free massive scalar field in 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Using Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we analyze the relative entropy between a coherent state and the vacuum state, with several types of test functions localized in the right Rindler wedge. Our results confirm that relative entropy decreases with increasing mass and grows with the size of the spacetime region, aligning with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Mixing rate exponent of planar Fortuin-Kasteleyn percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Duminil-Copin and Manolescu (2022) recently proved the scaling relations for planar Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolation. In particular, they showed that the one-arm exponent and the mixing rate exponent are sufficient to derive the other near-critical exponents. The scaling limit of critical FK percolation is conjectured to be a conformally invariant random collection of loops called the conformal loop ensemble (CLE). In this paper, we define the CLE analog of the mixing rate exponent. Assuming the convergence of FK percolation to CLE, we show that the mixing rate exponent for FK percolation agrees with that of CLE. We prove that the CLE$_\kappa$ mixing rate exponent equals $\frac{3 \kappa}{8}-1$, thereby answering Question 3 of Duminil-Copin and Manolescu (2022). The derivation of the CLE exponent is based on an exact formula for the Radon-Nikodym derivative between the marginal laws of the odd-level and even-level CLE loops, which is obtained from the coupling between Liouville quantum gravity and CLE.</description>

      <title>Intermittency and Dissipation Regularity in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lay down a geometric-analytic framework to capture properties of energy dissipation within weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations. For solutions with spatial Besov regularity, it is proved that the Duchon-Robert distribution has improved regularity in a negative Besov space and, in the case it is a Radon measure, it is absolutely continuous with respect to a suitable Hausdorff measure. This imposes quantitative constraints on the dimension of the, possibly fractal, dissipative set and the admissible structure functions exponents, relating to the phenomenon of "intermittency" in turbulence. As a by-product of the approach, we also recover many known "Onsager singularity" type results.</description>

      <title>Complex degenerate metrics in general relativity: a covariant extension of the Moore-Penrose algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moore-Penrose algorithm provides a generalized notion of an inverse, applicable to degenerate matrices. In this paper, we introduce a covariant extension of the Moore-Penrose method that permits to deal with general relativity involving complex non-invertible metrics. Unlike the standard technique, this approach guarantees the uniqueness of the pseudoinverse metric through the fulfillment of a set of covariant relations, and it allows for the proper definition of a covariant derivative operator and curvature-related tensors. Remarkably, the degenerate nature of the metric can be given a geometrical representation in terms of a torsion tensor, which vanishes only in special cases. Applications of the new scheme to complex black hole geometries and cosmological models are also investigated, and a generalized concept of geodesics that exploits the notion of autoparallel and extremal curves is presented. Relevance of our findings to quantum gravity and quantum cosmology is finally discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwarzian derivative plays a fundamental role in complex analysis, differential equations, and modular forms. In this paper, we investigate its higher-order generalizations, known as higher Schwarzians, and their connections to quasimodular forms and equivariant functions. We prove that a meromorphic function is equivariant if and only if its higher Schwarzians are quasimodular forms of prescribed weight and depth, thereby extending classical results and linking projective differential operators to the structure of modular and quasimodular forms.</description>

      <title>Spectral Instability of Random Fredholm Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $A \colon D(A) \subset \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ is an unbounded Fredholm operator of index $0$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ with a dense domain $D(A)$, then its spectrum is either discrete or the entire complex plane. This spectral dichotomy plays a central role in the study of \textit{magic angles} in twisted bilayer graphene.
  This paper proves that if such operators (with certain additional assumptions) are perturbed by certain random trace-class operators, their spectrum is discrete with high probability.</description>

      <title>Operator level soft edge to bulk transition in $\beta$-ensembles via canonical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic Airy and sine operators, which are respectively a random Sturm-Liouville operator and a random Dirac operator, characterize the soft edge and bulk scaling limits of $\beta$-ensembles. Dirac and Sturm-Liouville operators are distinct operator classes which can both be represented as canonical systems, which gives a unified framework for defining important properties, such as their spectral data. Seeing both as canonical systems, we prove that in a suitable high-energy scaling limit, the Airy operator converges to the sine operator. We prove this convergence in the vague topology of canonical systems' coefficient matrices, and deduce the convergence of the associated Weyl-Titchmarsh functions and spectral measures. Our proof relies on a coupling between the Brownian paths that drive the two operators, under which the convergence holds in probability. This extends the corresponding result at the level of the eigenvalue point processes, proven by Valk\'o and Vir\'ag (2009) by comparison to the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble.</description>

      <title>Stretching theory of Hookean metashells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being governed by the familiar laws of Hookean mechanics, elastic shells patterned with an internal structure (i.e. metashells) exhibit a wealth of unusual mechanical properties with no counterparts in unstructured materials. Here I show that much of this behavior can be captured by a real-valued analog of the inhomogeneous Schr\"odinger equation, with the lateral pressure experienced by the internal structure in the role of the wave function. In the fine structure limit $-$ i.e. when the length scale associated with the internal structure is much smaller than the local radius of curvature $-$ this approach reveals the existence of localized states, in which elastic deformations are prevented to diffuse away from their origin, thereby allowing the internal structure to smoothly adapt to the intrinsic geometry of the metashell. Leveraging on an analogy with scattering states in nearly free electrons, I further show that periodic metashells, obtained from the repetition of the same structural unit periodically in space, support elastic Bloch waves, corresponding to stationary periodic configurations of the internal structure and characterized by a geometry-dependent band structure. When applied to crystalline monolayers, this approach provides a generalization of the elastic theory of interacting topological defect to compressible systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a non-null torus-knotted gravitational monochromatic wave solution of the linearized Einstein equations in vacuum, employing the gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) framework by analogy with classical electrodynamics. We derive the geometric objects, including the line element, the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor, the Ricci scalar, and the geodesic equation for this background. Also, we investigate two properties inherent to this solution due to its GEM origin: the dual GEM potential and GEM helicity.</description>

      <title>Generalised Process Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process theories provide a powerful framework for describing compositional structures across diverse fields, from quantum mechanics to computational linguistics. Traditionally, they have been formalized using symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs). However, various generalizations, including time-neutral, higher-order, and enriched process theories, do not naturally conform to this structure. In this work, we propose an alternative formalization using operad algebras, motivated by recent results connecting SMCs to operadic structures, which captures a broader class of process theories. By leveraging the string-diagrammatic language, we provide an accessible yet rigorous formulation that unifies and extends traditional process-theoretic approaches. Our operadic framework not only recovers standard process theories as a special case but also enables new insights into quantum foundations and compositional structures. This work paves the way for further investigations into the algebraic and operational properties of generalised process theories within an operadic setting.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit and tail bounds for a random walk model of SOS level lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a random walk model for the level lines appearing in the entropic repulsion phenomena of three-dimensional discrete random interfaces above a hard wall; we are particularly motivated by the low-temperature (2+1)D solid-on-solid (SOS) model, where the emergence of these level lines has been rigorously established. The model we consider is a line ensemble of non-crossing random walk bridges above a wall with geometrically growing area tilts. Our main result, which in particular resolves a question of Caputo, Ioffe, and Wachtel (2019), is an edge 1:2:3 scaling limit for this ensemble as the domain size $N$ diverges, with a growing number of walks (including the number of level lines of the SOS model) and high boundary conditions (covering the maximum upper deviation of the SOS level lines). As a key input, we establish Tracy--Widom-type upper tail bounds for each of the relevant curves in the line ensemble. An ingredient which may be of independent interest is a ballot theorem for random walk bridges under a broader range of boundary values than available in the literature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a series of W-type differential operators, which appear naturally in the symmetry algebras of KP and BKP hierarchies. In particular, they include all operators in the W-constraints for tau functions of higher KdV hierarchies which satisfy the string equation. We will give simple uniform formulas for actions of these operators on all ordinary Schur functions and Schur's Q-functions. As applications of such formulas, we will give new simple proofs for Alexandrov's conjecture and Mironov-Morozov's formula, which express the Br\'{e}zin-Gross-Witten and Kontsevich-Witten tau-functions as linear combinations of Q-functions with simple coefficients respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantifying quantum coherence and the deviation from the total probability formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to quantify quantum coherence which, contrary to the previous ones, does not rely on resource theory but rather on ontological considerations. In this framework, coherence is understood as the ability for a quantum system's statistics to deviate from the total probability formula. After motivating the importance of the total probability formula in quantum foundations, we propose a new set of axioms that a measure of coherence should satisfy, and show that it defines a class of measures different from the main previous proposal. Finally, we prove a general result about the dependence of the l2-coherence norm on the basis of interest, and show that it is well approximated by the square root of the purity in most bases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous mean-field Bose gas at positive temperature. We show that spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking occurs if and only if the system displays Bose-Einstein condensation in the sense that the one-particle density matrix of the Gibbs state has a macroscopic eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>An intrinsically hydrodynamic approach to multidimensional QHD systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.05448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the multi-dimensional Quantum Hydrodynamics (QHD) system, by adopting an intrinsically hydrodynamic approach. The present work continues the analysis initiated in [6] where the one dimensional case was studied. Here we extend the analysis to the multi-dimensional problem, in particular by considering two physically relevant classes of solutions. First of all we consider two-dimensional initial data endowed with point vortices; by assuming the continuity of the mass density and a quantization rule for the vorticity we are able to study the Cauchy problem and provide global finite energy weak solutions. The same result can be obtained also by considering spherically symmetric initial data in the multi-dimensional setting. For rough solutions with finite energy, we are able to provide suitable dispersive estimates, which also apply to a more general class of Euler-Korteweg equations. Moreover we are also able to show the sequential stability of weak solutions with positive density. Analogously to the one dimensional case this is achieved through the a priori bounds given by a new functional first introduced in [6].</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-like Schr\"odinger Operators at Low Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08355v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Schr\"odinger operator on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold $X$ of dimension at least two, and suppose that the potential is of attractive Coulomb-like type. Using Vasy's second 2nd-microlocal approach, "the Lagrangian approach," we analyze -- uniformly, all the way down to $E=0$ -- the output of the limiting resolvent $R(E\pm i 0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} R(E\pm i \epsilon)$. The Coulomb potential causes the output of the low-energy resolvent to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora, and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as $r\to\infty$ times something polyhomogeneous. As a corollary, we get complete and compatible asymptotic expansions for solutions to the scattering problem as functions of both position and energy, with a transitional regime.</description>

      <title>Stationary solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct stationary statistical solutions of a deterministic unforced nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, by perturbing it by a linear damping $\gamma u$ and a stochastic force whose intensity is proportional to $\sqrt \gamma$, and then letting $\gamma\to 0^+$. We prove indeed that the family of stationary solutions $\{U_\gamma\}_{\gamma&gt;0}$ of the perturbed equation possesses an accumulation point for any vanishing sequence $\gamma_j\to 0^+$ and this stationary limit solves the deterministic unforced nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and is not the trivial zero solution. This technique has been introduced in [KS04], using a different dissipation. However considering a linear damping of zero order and weaker solutions we can deal with larger ranges of the nonlinearity and of the spatial dimension; moreover we consider the focusing equation and the defocusing equation as well.</description>

      <title>Geometric approach for the identification of Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some new Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type are presented and the analogue of Okamoto's space of initial conditions computed. Using the geometric approach that was introduced originally for the identification problem of Painlev\'e equations, comparing the irreducible components of the inaccessible divisors arising in the blow-up process, we find bi-rational coordinate changes between some of these systems that give rise to the same global Hamiltonian structure. This scheme thus gives a method for identifying Hamiltonian systems up to bi-rational maps, which is performed in this article for systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type having singularities that are either square-root type algebraic poles or ordinary poles.</description>

      <title>Computing the spectrum and pseudospectrum of infinite-volume operators from local patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the spectrum of normal discrete short-range infinite-volume operators can be approximated with two-sided error control using only data from finite-sized local patches. As a corollary, we prove the computability of the spectrum of such infinite-volume operators with the additional property of finite local complexity and provide an explicit algorithm. Such operators appear in many applications, e.g. as discretizations of differential operators on unbounded domains or as so-called tight-binding Hamiltonians in solid state physics. For a large class of such operators, our result allows for the first time to establish computationally also the absence of spectrum, i.e. the existence and the size of spectral gaps. We extend our results to the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of non-normal operators, proving that also the pseudospectrum of such operators is computable.</description>

      <title>Scattering off of Twistorial Line Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently devised chiral algebra bootstrap computes the form factors of a special class of ``twistorial'' 4d QFTs as correlation functions of the theory's 2d celestial chiral algebra. Examples of twistorial theories include self-dual Yang-Mills theory coupled to special massless matter content, and certain form factors in these theories are equivalent to a subset of MHV amplitudes in massless QCD, coupled to the same matter. In this paper, we extend the chiral algebra bootstrap to include scattering in the presence of charged sources, using a self-dual dyon in a twistorial theory as our main example. Self-dual theories in the presence of such sources lift to holomorphic gauge theories on non-Hausdorff twistor space, and we generalize the Koszul duality construction of Costello and Paquette to this setting. With this approach, we easily reproduce a recent formula of Adamo, Bogna, Mason, and Sharma for $n$-point MHV scattering of gluons off the self-dual dyon.</description>

      <title>Schmidt Decomposition of Multipartite States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum states can be written in infinitely many ways depending on the choices of basis. Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state has a lot of properties useful in the study of entanglement. All bipartite states admit Schmidt decomposition, but this does not extend to multipartite systems. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schmidt decompositions of multipartite states. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the decomposition for a Schmidt decomposable multipartite state.</description>

      <title>The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>
