      <title>Online EFX Allocations with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an online fair division problem where a fixed number of goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated to a given set of agents. Once a good arrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be immediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to ensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated. Unfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in general, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.
  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting algorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction vector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine learning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we measure their error using the total variation distance from the true valuations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with the true values.
  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility results even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore predictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both the predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the prediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate EFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary to the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the necessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with identical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values. The algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy of the predictions increases.</description>

      <title>Toward Energy and Location-Aware Resource Allocation in Next Generation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless networks are evolving from radio resource providers to complex systems that also involve computing, with the latter being distributed across edge and cloud facilities. Also, their optimization is shifting more and more from a performance to a value-oriented paradigm. The two aspects shall be balanced continuously, to maximize the utilities of Services Providers (SPs), users quality of experience and fairness, while meeting global constraints in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint among others, with all these heterogeneous resources contributing. In this paper, we tackle the problem of communication and compute resource allocation under energy constraints, with multiple SPs competing to get their preferred resource bundle by spending a a fictitious currency budget. By modeling the network as a Fisher market, we propose a low complexity solution able to achieve high utilities and guarantee energy constraints, while also promoting fairness among SPs, as compared to a social optimal solution. The market equilibrium is proved mathematically, and numerical results show the multi-dimensional trade-off between utility and energy at different locations, with communication and computation-intensive services.</description>

      <title>A New Three-Players Auction Bridge with Dynamic Opponents and Team Members</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a new three-player version of the bridge playing card game for the purpose of ending fixed partnerships so that the play can be more dynamic and flexible. By dynamically redefining team makeup in real time, this game design increases unpredictability and forces players to repeatedly update strategy. A novel scoring system is introduced to reduce biases present in conventional rule-based games by favoring fairness via reward systems that enforce tactical decision making and risk assessment. Being subject to regular bridge rules, this version tests players to collaborate without fixed friendships, requiring fluid adjustment and adaptive bidding behavior in real time. Strategic issues involve aggressive and defensive bidding, adaptable playing styles, and loss-seeking strategies specific to the three-player structure. The article discusses probabilistic issues of bidding, trump and no-trump declarative effects, and algorithmic methods to trick-taking. Simulation outcomes illustrate the efficiency of diverse strategies. The game's architecture is ideal for competitions and possibly influential in broadening entry pools for tournament card games.</description>

      <title>The Implicit Barrier of Utility Maximization: An Interior-Point Approach for Market Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of equilibria in exchange markets with divisible goods and players endowed with heterogeneous utilities. In this paper, we revisit the polynomial-time interior-point strategies that update \emph{only} the prices, mirroring the t\^atonnement process. The key ingredient is the \emph{implicit barrier} inherent in the utility maximization: the utility turns unbounded when the goods are almost free of charge. Focusing on a ubiquitous class of utilities, we formalize this observation into Scaled Lipschitz Continuity for utility maximization from both the primal and dual perspectives. A companion result suggests that no additional effort is required for computing high-order derivatives; all the necessary information is readily available when collecting the best responses. To tackle the Newton systems, we present an explicitly invertible approximation of the Hessian operator with high probability guarantees, and a scaling matrix that minimizes the condition number of the linear system. Building on these tools, we design two inexact interior-point methods. One such method has O(ln(1/{\epsilon})) complexity rate. Under mild conditions, the other method achieves a non-asymptotic superlinear convergence rate. Extensions and preliminary experiments are presented.</description>

      <title>Pairwise efficiency and monotonicity imply Pareto efficiency in (probabilistic) object allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider object allocation problems with capacities (see, e.g., Abdulkadiroglu and Sonmez, 1998; Basteck, 2025) where objects have to be assigned to agents. We show that if a lottery rule satisfies ex-post non-wastefulness and probabilistic (Maskin) monotonicity, then ex-post pairwise efficiency is equivalent to ex-post Pareto efficiency. This result allows for a strengthening of various existing characterization results, both for lottery rules and deterministic rules, by replacing (ex-post) Pareto efficiency with (ex-post) pairwise efficiency, e.g., for characterizations of the Random Serial Dictatorship rule (Basteck, 2025), Trading Cycles rules (Pycia and Unver, 2017), and Hierarchical Exchange rules (Papai, 2000).</description>

      <title>Inequality in the Age of Pseudonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings, as common to internet-based or blockchain-based platforms. One key challenge that arises is the ability of actors to create multiple fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently distort inequality metrics. As we show, when using inequality measures that satisfy literature's canonical set of desired properties, the presence of Sybils in an economy implies that it is impossible to properly measure the economy's inequality. Then, we present classes of Sybil-proof measures that satisfy relaxed versions of the aforementioned desired properties, and, by fully characterizing them, we prove that the structure imposed restricts their ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. In addition, we show that popular measures, liked the famous Gini coefficient, are not Sybil-proof. Finally, we examine the dynamics leading to the creation of Sybils in pseudonymous and traditional settings.</description>

      <title>Conservative classifiers do consistently well with improving agents: characterizing statistical and online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al. for both proper and improper learning.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Preventive and Reactive Defense Resource Allocation with Uncertain Sensor Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber attacks continue to be a cause of concern despite advances in cyber defense techniques. Although cyber attacks cannot be fully prevented, standard decision-making frameworks typically focus on how to prevent them from succeeding, without considering the cost of cleaning up the damages incurred by successful attacks. This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation problem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its investment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks, and reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes. This encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the observation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this uncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate how the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment in the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be achieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive resources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with higher sensor quality. We also show that the defender's performance improvement, relative to a baseline of no sensors employed, is maximal when the attacker can only achieve low attack success probabilities.</description>
