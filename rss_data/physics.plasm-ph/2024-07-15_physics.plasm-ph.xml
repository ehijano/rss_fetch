      <title>Outstanding questions and future research of magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short article highlights the unsolved problems of magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma. The advanced in-situ plasma measurements and simulations enabled scientists to gain a novel understanding of magnetic reconnection. Still, outstanding questions remain on the complex dynamics and structures in the diffusion region, on the cross-scale and regional couplings, on the onset of magnetic reconnection, and on the details of energetics. Future directions of the magnetic reconnection research in terms of new observations, new simulations and interdisciplinary approaches are discussed.</description>

      <title>Electron Tail Suppression and Effective Collisionality due to Synchrotron Emission and Absorption in Mildly Relativistic Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation losses are a significant cause of concern for high-temperature aneutronic fusion reactions such as proton-Boron 11. The fact that radiation losses occur primarily in the high-energy tail, where the radiation itself has a substantial impact on the electron distribution, necessitates a self-consistent approach to modeling the diffusion and drag induced by synchrotron absorption and emission. Furthermore, an accurate model must account for the fact that the radiation emission spectrum is momentum-dependent, and the plasma opacity is frequency-dependent. Here, we present a simple Fokker-Planck operator, built on a newly-solved-for blackbody synchrotron diffusion operator, which captures all relevant features of the synchrotron radiation. Focusing on magnetic mirror fusion plasmas, we show that significant suppression of the electron distribution occurs for relativistic values of the perpendicular electron momentum, which therefore emit much less radiation than predicted under the assumption of a Maxwell-Juttner distribution.</description>

      <title>DeepCSNet: a deep learning method for predicting electron-impact doubly differential ionization cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-impact ionization cross sections of atoms and molecules are essential for plasma modeling, yet their acquisition remains challenging. Experimental measurements often face difficulties due to particle instability, and ab initio calculations become computationally prohibitive as molecular complexity increases. Existing AI-based prediction methods suffer from limited data availability and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose DeepCSNet, a deep learning approach designed to predict electron-impact ionization cross sections using minimal training data. We present two configurations of DeepCSNet: one tailored for specific molecules and another for various molecules. Our numerical results, focusing on electron-impact doubly differential ionization cross sections, demonstrate DeepCSNet's superior generalization ability, accurately predicting cross sections across a wide range of energies and incident angles. Additionally, DeepCSNet shows promising results in predicting cross sections for previously unencountered molecules, highlighting its potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Bursts Generated by the Ion-Ion Acoustic Instability with Solar Wind Plasma Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is motivated by recent observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission, which have been identified as the ion-acoustic waves from 15 to 25 solar radii. These observations reveal characteristic sequences of narrow-band, high-frequency bursts exceeding 100 Hz embedded into a slower evolution around 1 Hz, persisting for several hours. To explore the potential role of the ion-acoustic instability (IAI) in these phenomena, we begin by reviewing classical findings on the IAI within the framework of linear kinetic theory. Focusing on proton distributions comprising both a core and a beam component, we analyze the IAI instability range and growth rates within the parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. Our findings indicate that the IAI can indeed occur in this regime, albeit requiring electron-to-core and beam-to-core temperature ratios slightly different from reported values during electrostatic burst detection. Furthermore, employing 1D kinetic plasma simulations, we validate the growth rates predicted by linear theory and observe the saturation behavior of the instability. The resultant nonlinear structures exhibit trapped proton beam populations and oscillatory signatures comparable to those observed, both in terms of time scales and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Global destabilization of drift-tearing mode with coupling to discretized electron drift-wave instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global linear behaviors of 2/1 DTM in the collisional regime are investigated based on a concisely resistive drift-MHD model. Besides DTM, extra normal modes including EDW and SAW are coupled together and destabilized in different parameter regimes by considering resistivity in this system. The EVP approach is applied for solving the eigenstate spectra with the distribution of all unstable solutions. It is found that in the small EDD frequency (omega_*e) regime, DTM growth rate agrees well with local theory that is reduced with increasing omega_*e. However, when omega_*e exceeds a critical threshold omega_*crit, the strongly linear coupling between DTM and other discretized EDW instabilities happens so that the free energies from current and pressure channels can be released together and thus enhance the DTM, of which growth rate increases with increasing omega_*e and deviates from local theory results qualitatively. Correspondingly, a cross-scale mode structure forms with mixed polarization, namely, phi perturbation is dominated by electrostatic polarized short-wavelength oscillation as EDW instability character, and A_para perturbation remains typical tearing mode solution of Alfvenic polarized macroscopic structure. Within omega_*e &gt; omega_*crit, the additional IDD causes phi oscillating structure to shift towards small density gradient domain, which cancels the extra drive from ion channel and thus DTM growth rate is insensitive to IDD frequency. Compared to EDD effects, the IDD effect alone with zero-omega_*e only leads to the stabilization of RTM that shows agreements between global simulation and local theory, which is no longer the condition for DTM regime. These results are useful for clarifying the DTM global properties with underlying physics mechanisms, which occurs in the regime of omega_*e &gt;&gt; gamma_c that is relevant to nowadays tokamak discharges with hot plasmas.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Proton and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of simulations of magnetic reconnection accompanied by electron and proton heating and energization in a macroscale system are presented. Both species form extended powerlaw distributions that extend nearly three decades in energy. The primary drive mechanism for the production of these nonthermal particles is Fermi reflection within evolving and coalescing magnetic flux ropes. While the powerlaw indices of the two species are comparable, the protons overall gain more energy than electrons and their power law extends to higher energy. The power laws roll into a hot thermal distribution at low energy with the transition energy occurring at lower energy for electrons compared with protons. A strong guide field diminishes the production of non-thermal particles by reducing the Fermi drive mechanism. In solar flares, proton power laws should extend down to 10's of keV, far below the energies that can be directly probed via gamma-ray emission. Thus, protons should carry much more of the released magnetic energy than expected from direct observations.</description>

      <title>Coupling Fluid Plasma and Kinetic Neutral Models using Correlated Monte Carlo Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While boundary plasmas in present day tokamaks generally fall in a fluid regime, neutral species near the boundary often require kinetic models due to long mean-free-paths compared to characteristic spatial scales in the region. Monte-Carlo (MC) methods provide a complete, high-fidelity approach to solving kinetic models, and must be coupled to fluid plasma models to simulate the full plasma-neutrals system. The statistical nature of MC methods, however, prevents convergence of coupled fluid-kinetic simulations to an exact self-consistent steady-state. Moreover, this forces the use of explicit methods that can suffer from numerical errors and require huge computational resources.
  Correlated Monte-Carlo (CMC) methods are expected to alleviate these issues, but have historically enjoyed only mixed success. Here, a fully implicit method for coupled plasma-neutral systems is demonstrated in 1D using the UEDGE plasma code and a homemade CMC code. In particular, it is shown that ensuring the CMC method is a differentiable function of the background plasma is sufficient to employ a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov solver for implicit time steps. The convergence of the implicit coupling method is explored and compared with explicit coupling and uncorrelated methods. It is shown that ensuring differentiability by controlling random seeds in the MC is sufficient to achieve convergence, and that the use of implicit time-stepping methods has the potential for improved stability and runtimes over explicit coupling methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive conservative closures of the Vlasov-Poisson equations discretized in velocity via the symmetrically weighted Hermite spectral expansion. The short note analyzes the conservative closures preservation of the hyperbolicity and anti-symmetry of the Vlasov equation. Furthermore, we verify numerically the analytically derived conservative closures on simulating a classic electrostatic benchmark problem: the Langmuir wave. The numerical results and analytic analysis show that the closure by truncation is the most suitable conservative closure for the symmetrically weighted Hermite formulation.</description>

      <title>Quenching of Tearing Mode Instability by Transverse Magnetic Fields in Reconnection Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tearing mode instability is a key process for magnetic energy conversion in magnetohydrodynamics, once anti-parallel components are allowed to reconnect, leading to the formation of magnetic islands. It has been employed to explain phenomena at different scales in nature, from galactic nuclei, to solar flares and laboratory fusion devices. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of a current sheet in the presence of a transverse magnetic field component, in the framework of viscoresistive, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), both analytically and by means of direct numerical simulations. Firstly, we obtain analytical solution for the time-varying one-dimensional profile of an initial Harris current sheet in the presence of a transverse field. We find that the introduction of a transverse magnetic field disrupts the system's equilibrium, leading to the natural development of a neutral layer with shear flows within the current sheet, one along the antiparallel magnetic component and another along the guide field direction. Secondly, through numerical analysis, we examine the dispersion relation of the incompressible MHD equations in the context of a modified equilibrium profile due to the transverse field. Our findings indicate a rapid suppression of unstable modes of tearing instability with the width of the neutral layer, confirming the analytical predictions. These results offer new insightful understanding on the interplay between transverse magnetic fields, shear flows, and tearing mode instabilities in current sheet environments.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the helicity barrier from measurements of the turbulence transition range in the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The means by which the turbulent cascade of energy is dissipated in the solar wind, and in other astrophysical systems, is a major open question. It has recently been proposed that a barrier to the transfer of energy can develop at small scales, which can enable heating through ion-cyclotron resonance, under conditions applicable to regions of the solar wind. Such a scenario fundamentally diverges from the standard picture of turbulence, where the energy cascade proceeds unimpeded until it is dissipated. Here, using data from NASA's Parker Solar Probe, we find that the shape of the magnetic energy spectrum around the ion gyroradius varies with solar wind parameters in a manner consistent with the presence of such a barrier. This allows us to identify critical values of some of the parameters necessary for the barrier to form; we show that the barrier appears fully developed for ion plasma beta of below $\simeq0.5$ and becomes increasingly prominent with imbalance for normalised cross helicity values greater than $\simeq0.4$. As these conditions are frequently met in the solar wind, particularly close to the Sun, our results suggest that the barrier is likely playing a significant role in turbulent dissipation in the solar wind and so is an important mechanism in explaining its heating and acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare three different approaches to describe a magnetic island in a generic toroidal plasma: (i) perturbative, from the perspective of the equilibrium magnetic field and the related action in a variational principle formulation, (ii) again perturbative, based on the integrability of a system with a single resonant mode and the application of a canonical transformation onto a new island equilibrium system, and (iii) non-perturbative, making use of a full geometric description of the island considered as a stand-alone plasma domain. For the three approaches, we characterize some observables and discuss the respective limits.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Kinetic Effects on Current Gradient-Driven Instabilities of Electron Current Layers via Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron current layers form in various natural and laboratory plasmas and are susceptible to several instabilities. Tearing, driven by current gradients, stands out as a prominent instability in these layers and is considered a potential mechanism for magnetic reconnection in collisionless regimes. Electron inertia serves as a non-ideal factor causing magnetic field lines to break and subsequently reconnect. Another mode driven by current gradients, known as the surface-preserving mode, maintains magnetic field topology. We investigated the kinetic effects on these modes in the presence of finite electron temperatures using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations (implemented with the OSIRIS codebase). Temperature stabilizes the tearing mode to a large extent, except at low temperatures, due to increased electron Larmor radius and subsequent magnetic field diffusion. Introducing uniform guide fields revealed that growth rates decrease at higher temperatures due to reduced plasma beta. Conversely, for the surface-preserving mode, growth rates increase with temperature, likely due to enhanced electron flow velocities. Mixed modes, where both tearing and surface-preserving modes coexist, exhibit asymmetric structures characteristic of asymmetric magnetic reconnection. Finally, we propose future research directions building upon our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study hydrodynamic thermal transport in high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems placed in an in-plane magnetic field, and identify a new mechanism of thermal magnetotransport. This mechanism is caused by drag between the electron populations with opposite spin polarization, which arises in the presence of a hydrodynamic flow of heat. In high mobility systems, spin drag results in strong thermal magnetoresistance, which becomes of the order of 100% at relatively small spin polarization of the electron liquid. We express the thermal magnetoresistance in terms of intrinsic dissipative coefficients of electron fluid and show that it is primarily determined by the spin diffusion constant.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional theory of superradiant free-electron lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime, including the effects of beam emittance and energy spread. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intense highly charged ion beam production is essential for high-power heavy ion accelerators. A novel movable Vlasov launcher for superconducting high charge state Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source has been devised that can affect the microwave power effectiveness by a factor of about 4 in terms of highly charged ion beam production. This approach based on a dedicated microwave launching system instead of the traditional coupling scheme has led to new insight on microwave-plasma interaction. With this new understanding, the world record highly charged xenon ion beam currents have been enhanced by up to a factor of 2, which could directly and significantly enhance the performance of heavy ion accelerators and provide many new research opportunities in nuclear physics, atomic physics and other disciplines.</description>

Abstract: Circularly polarized waves consistent with parallel-propagating ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) and fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs) are often observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ion kinetic scales. Such waves damp energy via the cyclotron resonance, with such damping expected to play a significant role in the enhanced, anisotropic heating of the solar wind observed in the inner heliosphere. We employ a linear plasma dispersion solver, PLUME, to evaluate frequencies of ICWs and FMWs in the plasma rest frame and Doppler-shift them to the spacecraft frame, calculating their damping rates at frequencies where persistently high values of circular polarization are observed. We find such ion-scale waves are observed during $20.37\%$ of PSP Encounters 1 and 2 observations and their plasma frame frequencies are consistent with them being transient ICWs. We estimate significant ICW dissipation onto protons, consistent with previous empirical estimates for the total turbulent damping rates, indicating that ICW dissipation could account for the observed enhancements in the proton temperature and its anisotropy with respect to the mean magnetic field.</description>
