      <title>Low regularity analysis of the Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in the cylinder. We improve the local wellposedness to spaces of regularity $s &gt; 1/2$. The result is optimal in terms of the corresponding bilinear estimate or Picard iteration. Our method is based on an improvement of the understanding of the resonant set, identifying and exploiting its particular geometric properties. We also consider the problem under randomization of the initial data, in which case we obtain solutions for generic data in $H^{s}$ for some $s &lt; 0$. To do so, we consider a novel approach based on lower regularity modifications of the classical $X^{s, b}$ spaces that allow to control concentration of mass in small sets of frequencies.</description>

      <title>Gradient and Transport Estimates for Heat Flow on Nonconvex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the Neumann heat flow on nonconvex Riemannian domains $D\subset M$, we provide sharp gradient estimates and transport estimates with a novel $\sqrt t$-dependence, for instance, $$\text{Lip}( P^D_tf)\le e^{2S \, \sqrt{t/\pi}+\mathcal{O}(t)}\cdot \text{Lip} (f),$$ and we provide an equivalent characterization of the lower bound $S$ on the second fundamental form of the boundary in terms of these quantitative estimates.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to focusing Sobolev critical biharmonic Schr\"{o}dinger equation with mixed dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the following focusing biharmonic Schr\"{o}dinger equation with mixed dispersion and Sobolev critical growth: $$ \begin{cases}
  {\Delta}^2u-\Delta u-\lambda u-\mu|u|^{p-2}u-|u|^{4^*-2}u=0\ \ \mbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N, \\[0.1cm]
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u^2 dx = c, \end{cases} 
$$ where $N \geq 5$, $\mu,c&gt;0$, $2&lt;p&lt;4^*:=\frac{2N}{N-4}$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is a Lagrange multiplier. For this problem, under the $L^2$-subcritical perturbation ($2&lt;p&lt;2+\frac{8}{N}$), we derive the existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions via the truncation technique, concentration-compactness principle and the genus theory presented by C.O. Alves et al. (Arxiv, (2021), doi: 2103.07940v2). Compared to the results of C.O. Alves et al. we obtain a more general result after removing the further assumptions given in (3.2) of their paper. In the case of $L^2$-supercritical perturbation ($2+\frac{8}{N}&lt;p&lt;4^*$), we explore the existence results of normalized solutions by applying the constrained variational methods and the mountain pass theorem. Moreover, we propose a novel method to address the effects of the dispersion term $\Delta u$. This approach allows us to extend the recent results obtained by X. Chang et al. (Arxiv, (2023), doi: 2305.00327v1) to the mixed dispersion situation.</description>

      <title>Inversion of generalized Radon transform over symmetric $m$-tensor fields in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a set of generalized Radon transforms over symmetric $m$-tensor fields in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The longitudinal/transversal Radon transform and corresponding weighted integral transforms for symmetric $m$-tensor field are introduced. We give the kernel descriptions for the longitudinal and transversal Radon transform. Further, we also prove that a symmetric $m$-tensor field can be recovered uniquely from certain combinations of these integral transforms of the unknown tensor field. This generalizes a recent study done for the recovery of vector fields from its weighted Radon transform data to recovery of a symmetric $m$-tensor field from analogously defined weighted Radon transforms.</description>

      <title>Lifespan estimate for the semilinear regular Euler-Poisson-Darboux-Tricomi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we begin by establishing local well-posedness for the semilinear regular Euler-Poisson-Darboux-Tricomi equation. Subsequently, we derive a lifespan estimate with the Strauss index given by $p=p_{S}(n+\frac{\mu}{m+1}, m)$ for any $\delta&gt;0$, where $\delta$ is a parameter to describe the interplay between damping and mass. This is achieved through the construction of a new test function derived from the Gaussian hypergeometric function and a second-order ordinary differential inequality, as proven by Zhou \cite{Zhou2014}. Additionally, we extend our analysis to prove a blow-up result with the index $p=\max\{p_{S}(n+\frac{\mu}{m+1}, m), p_{F}((m+1)n+\frac{\mu-1-\sqrt\delta}{2})\}$ by applying Kato$^{\prime}$s Lemma ( i.e., Lemma \ref{katolemma} ), specifically in the case of $\delta=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex integral formula provides an explicit solution of the initial value problem for the nonlinear scala 1D equation $u\_t+[f(u)]\_x=0$, for any flux $f(u)$ and initial condition $u\_0(x)$ that are analytic. This formula is valid at least as long as $u$ remains analytic.</description>

      <title>On a Brain Tumor Growth Model with Lactate Metabolism, Viscoelastic Effects, and Tissue Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlinearly coupled initial-boundary value problem describing the evolution of brain tumor growth including lactate metabolism. In our modeling approach, we also take into account the viscoelastic properties of the tissues as well as the reversible damage effects that could occur, possibly caused by surgery. After introducing the PDE system, coupling a Fischer-Kolmogorov type equation for the tumor phase with a reaction-diffusion equation for the lactate, a quasi-static momentum balance with nonlinear elasticity and viscosity matrices, and a nonlinear differential inclusion for the damage, we prove the existence of global in time weak solutions under reasonable assumptions on the involved functions and data. Strengthening these assumptions, we subsequently prove further regularity properties of the solutions as well as their continuous dependence with respect to the data, entailing the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem associated with the nonlinear PDE system.</description>

      <title>Inf-sup condition for Stokes with outflow condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inf-sup condition is one of the essential tools in the analysis of the Stokes equations and especially in numerical analysis. In its usual form, the condition states that for every pressure $p\in L^2(\Omega)\setminus \mathbb{R}$, (i.e. with mean value zero) a velocity $u\in H^1_0(\Omega)^d$ can be found, so that $(div\,u,p)=\|p\|^2$ and $\|\nabla u\|\le c \|p\|$ applies, where $c&gt;0$ does not depend on $u$ and $p$. However, if we consider domains that have a Neumann-type outflow condition on part of the boundary $\Gamma_N\subset\partial\Omega$, the inf-sup condition cannot be used in this form, since the pressure here comes from $L^2(\Omega)$ and does not necessarily have zero mean value. In this note, we derive the inf-sup condition for the case of outflow boundaries.</description>

      <title>Conditional Speed and Shape Corrections for Travelling Wave Solutions to Stochastically Perturbed Reaction-Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we perform rigorous small noise expansions to study the impact of stochastic forcing on the behaviour of planar travelling wave solutions to reaction-diffusion equations on cylindrical domains. In particular, we use a stochastic freezing approach that allows effective limiting information to be extracted concerning the behaviour of the stochastic perturbations from the deterministic wave. As an application, this allows us to provide a rigorous definition for the stochastic corrections to the wave speed. In addition, our approach allows their size to be computed to any desired order in the noise strength, provided that sufficient smoothness is available.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for the dNLS hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness for higher-order equations in the so-called dNLS hierarchy (also known as part of the Kaup-Newell hierarchy) in almost critical Fourier-Lebesgue and in modulation spaces. Leaning in on estimates proven by the author in a previous instalment Adams (2024), where a similar well-posedness theory was developed for the equations of the NLS hierarchy, we show the $j$th equation in the dNLS hierarchy is locally well-posed for initial data in $\hat H^s_r(\mathbb{R})$ for $s \ge \frac{1}{2} + \frac{j-1}{r'}$ and $1 &lt; r \le 2$ and also in $M^s_{2, p}(\mathbb{R})$ for $s \ge \frac{j}{2}$ and $2 \le p &lt; \infty$. Supplementing our results with corresponding ill-posedness results in Fourier-Lebesgue and modulation spaces shows optimality.
  Our arguments are based on the Fourier restriction norm method in Bourgain spaces adapted to our data spaces and the gauge-transformation commonly associated with the dNLS equation. For the latter we establish bi-Lipschitz continuity between appropriate modulation spaces and that even for higher-order equations `bad' cubic nonlinear terms are lifted from the equation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical versions of Morgan's Uncertainty Principle and Electromagnetic Schr\"{o}dinger Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the unique continuation properties of solutions of the electromagnetic Schr\"{o}dinger equation
  $$
  i\partial_{t}u(x,t)+(\nabla-i A)^{2}u(x,t)=V(x,t)u(x,t)\,\,\,\, \mbox{in} \,\,\,\mathbb{R}^{n}\times [0,1],
  $$
  where $A$ represents a time-independent magnetic vector potential and $V$ is a bounded, complex valued time-dependent potential. Given $1&lt;p&lt;2$ and $1/p+1/q=1$, we prove that if
  \begin{equation*}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}|u(x,0)|^{2}e^{2\alpha^{p}|x|^p/p}\ d x
  +\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}|u(x,1)|^{2}e^{2\beta^{q}|x|^q/q}\ d x
  &lt;\infty,
  \end{equation*}
  for some $\alpha,\beta&gt;0$ and there exists $N_{p}&gt;0$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
  \alpha\beta&gt;N_p,
  \end{equation*}
  then $u\equiv 0$. These results can be interpreted as dynamical versions of the uncertainty principle of Morgan's type. Furthermore, as an application, our results extend to a large class of semi-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equations.</description>

      <title>Tollmien-Schlichting waves near neutral stable curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the linear stability of boundary layer flows over a flat plate. Tollmien, Schlichting, Lin et al. found that there exists a neutral curve, which consists of two branches: lower branch $\alpha_{low}(Re)$ and upper branch $\alpha_{up}(Re)$. Here, $\alpha$ is the wave number and $Re$ is the Reynolds number. For any $\alpha\in(\alpha_{low},\alpha_{up})$, there exist unstable modes known as Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves to the linearized Navier-Stokes system. These waves play a key role during the early stage of boundary layer transition. In a breakthrough work (\textit{Duck math Jour, 165(2016)}), Grenier, Guo, and Nguyen provided a rigorous construction of the unstable T-S waves. In this paper, we confirm the existence of the neutral stable curve. To achieve this, we develop a more delicate method for solving the Orr-Sommerfeld equation by borrowing some ideas from the triple-deck theory. This approach allows us to construct the T-S waves in a neighborhood of the neutral curve.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic solution for three-dimensional reaction-diffusion-advection equation with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of moving fronts in three-dimensional spaces, which form as a result of in-situ combustion during oil production. This phenomenon is also observed in other contexts, such as various autowave models and the propagation of acoustic waves. Our analysis involves a singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion-advection type initial-boundary value problem of a general form. We employ methods from asymptotic theory to develop an approximate smooth solution with an internal layer. Using local coordinates, we focus on the transition layer, where the solution undergoes rapid changes. Once the location of the transition layer is established, we can describe the solution across the full domain of the problem. Numerical examples are provided, demonstrating the high accuracy of the asymptotic method in predicting the behaviors of moving fronts.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the operator \(D^+_VD^-_W:=\Delta_{W,V}\) on the one-dimensional torus \(\mathbb{T}\). Here, \(W\) and \(V\) are functions inducing (possibly atomic) positive Borel measures on \(\mathbb{T}\), and the derivatives are generalized lateral derivatives. For the first time in this work, the space of test functions \(C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})\) emerges as the natural regularity space for solutions of the eigenproblem associated with \(\Delta_{W,V}\). Moreover, these spaces are essential for characterizing the energetic space \(H_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})\) as a Sobolev-type space. By observing that the Sobolev-type spaces \(H_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})\) with additional Dirichlet conditions are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we introduce the so-called \(W\)-Brownian bridges as mean-zero Gaussian processes with associated Cameron-Martin spaces derived from these spaces. This framework allows us to introduce \(W\)-Brownian motion as a Feller process with a two-parameter semigroup and c\`adl\`ag sample paths, whose jumps are subordinated to the jumps of \(W\). We establish a deep connection between \(W\)-Brownian motion and these Sobolev-type spaces through their associated Cameron-Martin spaces. Finally, as applications of the developed theory, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of related deterministic and stochastic differential equations.</description>

Abstract: Given a metric measure space $(\mathcal{X}, d, \mu)$ satisfying the volume doubling condition, we consider a semigroup $\{S_t\}$ and the associated heat operator. We propose general conditions on the heat kernel so that the solutions of the associated heat equations attain the initial data pointwise. We demonstrate that these conditions are satisfied by a broad class of operators, including the Laplace operators perturbed by a gradient, fractional Laplacian, mixed local-nonlocal operators, Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds, Dunkl Laplacian and many more. In addition, we consider the Laplace operator in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the Hardy potential and establish a characterization for the pointwise convergence to the initial data. We also prove similar results for the nonhomogeneous equations and showcase an application for the power-type nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Multiple front and pulse solutions in spatially periodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a comprehensive mathematical toolbox for the construction and spectral stability analysis of stationary multiple front and pulse solutions to general semilinear evolution problems on the real line with spatially periodic coefficients. Starting from a collection of $N$ nondegenerate primary front solutions with matching periodic end states, we realize multifront solutions near a formal concatenation of these $N$ primary fronts, provided the distances between the front interfaces is sufficiently large. Moreover, we prove that nondegenerate primary pulses are accompanied by periodic pulse solutions of large spatial period. We show that spectral (in)stability properties of the underlying primary fronts or pulses are inherited by the bifurcating multifronts or periodic pulse solutions. The existence and spectral analyses rely on contraction-mapping arguments and Evans-function techniques, leveraging exponential dichotomies to characterize invertibility and Fredholm properties. To demonstrate the applicability of our methods, we analyze the existence and stability of multifronts and periodic pulse solutions in some benchmark models, such as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with periodic potential and a Klausmeier reaction-diffusion-advection system, thereby identifying novel classes of (stable) solutions. In particular, our methods yield the first spectral and orbital stability result of periodic waves in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with periodic potential, as well as new instability criteria for multipulse solutions to this equation.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}^{1}$ and $\mathrm{bmo}$ regularity for wave equations with rough coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider second-order hyperbolic equations with rough time-independent coefficients. Our main result is that such equations are well posed on the Hardy space $\mathcal{H}^{s,1}_{FIO}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ for Fourier integral operators if the coefficients have $C^{1,1}\cap C^{r}$ regularity in space, for $r&gt;\frac{n+1}{2}$, where $s$ ranges over an $r$-dependent interval. As a corollary, we obtain the sharp fixed-time $\mathcal{H}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and $\mathrm{bmo}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ regularity for such equations, extending work by Seeger, Sogge and Stein in the case of smooth coefficients.</description>

      <title>Uniform attraction and exit problems for stochastic damped wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of wave equations with constant damping and polynomial nonlinearities that are perturbed by small, multiplicative, space-time white noise. The equations are defined on a one-dimensional bounded interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions, continuous initial position and distributional initial velocity. In the first part of this work, we study the corresponding deterministic dynamics and prove that certain neighborhoods of asymptotically stable equilibria are uniformly attracting in the topology of uniform convergence. Then, we consider exit problems for local solutions of the stochastic damped wave equations from bounded domains $D$ of uniform attraction. Using tools from large deviations along with novel controllability results, we obtain logarithmic asymptotics for exit times and exit places, in the vanishing noise limit, that are expressed in terms of the corresponding quasipotential. In doing so, we develop arguments that take into account the lack of both smoothing and exact controllability that are inherent to the problem at hand. Moreover, our exit time results provide asymptotic lower bounds for the mean explosion time of local solutions. We introduce a novel notion of "regular" boundary points allowing to avoid the question of boundary smoothness in infinite dimensions and leading to the proof of a large deviations lower bound for the exit place. We illustrate this notion by providing explicit examples for different classes of domains $D$. Conditions under which lower and upper bounds for exit time and exit place logarithmic asymptotic hold, are also presented. In addition, we obtain deterministic stability results for linear damped wave equations that are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove uniform Sobolev bounds for solutions of the Laplace equation on a general family of K\"ahler manifolds with bounded Nash entropy and Calabi energy. These estimates establish a connection to the theory of RCD spaces and provide abundant examples of RCD spaces topologically and holomorphically equivalent to projective varieties. Suppose $X$ is a normal projective variety that admits a resolution of singularities with relative nef or relative effective anti-canonical bundle. Then every admissible singular K\"ahler metric on $X$ with Ricci curvature bounded below induces a non-collapsed RCD space homeomorphic to the projective variety $X$ itself.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analysis of large-space and long-time asymptotics for the short-pulse soliton gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously analyze the asymptotics of soliton gases to the short-pulse (SP) equation. The soliton gas is formulated in terms of a RH problem, which is derived from the RH problems of the $N$-soliton solutions with $N \to \infty$. Building on prior work in the study of the KdV soliton gas and orthogonal polynomials with Jacobi-type weights, we extend the reflection coefficient to two generalized forms on the interval $\left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right]$: $r_0(\lambda) = \left(\lambda - \eta_1\right)^{\beta_1}\left(\eta_2 - \lambda\right)^{\beta_2}|\lambda - \eta_0|^{\beta_0}\gamma(\lambda)$, $r_c(\lambda) = \left(\lambda - \eta_1\right)^{\beta_1}\left(\eta_2 - \lambda\right)^{\beta_2}\chi_c(\lambda)\gamma(\lambda)$, where $0 &lt; \eta_1 &lt; \eta_0 &lt; \eta_2$ and $\beta_j &gt; -1$ ($j = 0, 1, 2$), $\gamma(\lambda)$ is continuous and positive on $\left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right]$, with an analytic extension to a neighborhood of this interval, $\chi_c(\lambda) = 1$ for $\lambda \in \left[\eta_1, \eta_0\right)$ and $\chi_c(\lambda) = c^2$ for $\lambda \in \left(\eta_0, \eta_2\right]$, where $c&gt;0$ with $c \neq 1$. The asymptotic analysis is performed using the steepest descent method. A key aspect of the analysis is the construction of the $g$-function. To address the singularity at the origin, we introduce an innovative piecewise definition of $g$-function. To establish the order of the error term, we construct local parametrices near $\eta_j$ for $j = 1, 2$, and singularity $\eta_0$. At the endpoints, we employ the Airy parametrix and the first type of modified Bessel parametrix. At the singularity $\eta_0$, we use the second type of modified Bessel parametrix for $r_0$ and confluent hypergeometric parametrix for $r_c(\lambda)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the long-time asymptotics for the $N_{\infty}$-soliton solution to the KdV equation in the different regions with the aid of the Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems with two types of generalized reflection coefficients on the interval $\left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right]\in \mathbb{R}^+$: $r_0(\lambda,\eta_0; \beta_0, \beta_1,\beta_2)=\left(\lambda-\eta_1\right)^{\beta_1}\left(\eta_2-\lambda\right)^{\beta_2}\left|\lambda-\eta_0\right|^{\beta_0}\gamma\left(\lambda\right)$, $r_c(\lambda,\eta_0; \beta_1,\beta_2)=\left(\lambda-\eta_1\right)^{\beta_1}\left(\eta_2-\lambda\right)^{\beta_2}\chi_c\left(\lambda, \eta_0\right)\gamma \left(\lambda\right)$, where the singularity $\eta_0\in (\eta_1, \eta_2)$ and $\beta_j&gt;-1$ ($j=0, 1, 2$), $\gamma: \left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right] \to\mathbb{R}^+$ is continuous and positive on $\left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right]$, with an analytic extension to a neighborhood of this interval, and the step-like function $\chi_c$ is defined as $\chi_c\left(\lambda,\eta_0\right)=1$ for $\lambda\in\left[\eta_1, \eta_0\right)$ and $\chi_c\left(\lambda,\eta_0\right)=c^2$ for $\lambda\in\left(\eta_0, \eta_2\right]$ with $c&gt;0, \, c\ne1$. A critical step in the analysis of RH problems via the Deift-Zhou steepest descent technique is how to construct local parametrices around the endpoints $\eta_j$'s and the singularity $\eta_0$. Specifically, the modified Bessel functions of indexes $\beta_j$'s are utilized for the endpoints $\eta_j$'s, and the modified Bessel functions of index $\left(\beta_0\pm 1\right)\left/\right.2$ and confluent hypergeometric functions are employed around the singularity $\eta_0$ if the reflection coefficients are $r_0$ and $r_c$, respectively. This comprehensive study extends the understanding of generalized reflection coefficients and provides valuable insights into the asymptotics of soliton gases.</description>

      <title>Tail bounds for the Dyson series of random Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger equations on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$ with random potentials of strength $\lambda$. Our main result gives tail bounds for the terms of the Dyson series that are effective at time scales on the order of $\lambda^{-2+\varepsilon}$. As corollaries, we obtain estimates on the frequency localization and spatial delocalization of approximate eigenfunctions in the spirit of works by Schlag-Shubin-Wolff and T. Chen. These estimates also apply to Floquet states associated to time-periodic potentials. Our proof is elementary in that we use neither sophisticated harmonic analysis nor diagrammatic arguments. Instead, we use only the noncommutative Khintchine inequality from random matrix theory combined with pointwise dispersive estimates for the free Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1706.04094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an ecology model in which the population is structured by a spatial variable and a phenotypic trait. The model combines a parabolic operator on the spatial variable with a kinetic operator on the trait variable. We prove the existence of solutions to that model, and show that these solutions are unique. The kinetic operator present in the model, that represents the effect of sexual reproductions, satisfies a Tanaka-type inequality: it implies a contraction of the Wasserstein distance in the space of phenotypic traits. We combine this contraction argument with parabolic estimates controlling the spatial regularity of solutions to prove the convergence of the population size and the mean phenotypic trait to solutions of the Kirkpatrick-Barton model, which is a well-established model in evolutionary ecology. Specifically, at high reproductive rates, we provide explicit convergence estimates for the moments of solutions of the kinetic model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quasi-classical limit of Nelson-type regularized polaron models describing a particle interacting with a quantized bosonic field. We break translation-invariance by adding an attractive external potential decaying at infinity, acting on the particle. In the strong coupling limit where the field behaves classically we prove that the model's energy quasi-minimizers strongly converge to ground states of the limiting Pekar-like non-linear model. This holds for arbitrarily small external attractive potentials, hence this binding is fully due to the interaction with the bosonic field. We use a new approach to the construction of quasi-classical measures to revisit energy convergence, and a localization method in a concentration-compactness type argument to obtain convergence of states.</description>

Abstract: The thermodynamical model of viscoelastic deformable solids at finite strains with Kelvin-Voigt rheology with a higher-order viscosity (using the concept of multipolar materials) is formulated in a fully Eulerian way in rates. Assumptions used in this paper allow for a physically justified free energy leading to non-negative entropy that satisfies the 3rd law of thermodynamics, i.e. entropy vanishes at zero temperature, and energy-controlled stress. This last attribute is used advantageously to prove the existence and a certain regularity of weak solutions by a simplified Faedo-Galerkin semi-discretization, based on estimates obtained from the total-energy and the mechanical-energy balances. Some examples that model neo-Hookean-type materials are presented, too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate both forward and backward problems for coupled systems of time-fractional diffusion equations, encompassing scenarios of strong coupling. For the forward problem, we establish the well-posedness of the system, leveraging the eigensystem of the corresponding elliptic system as the foundation. When considering the backward problem, specifically the determination of initial values through final time observations, we demonstrate a Lipschitz stability estimate, which is consistent with the stability observed in the case of a single equation. To numerically address this backward problem, we refer to the explicit formulation of Tikhonov regularization to devise a multi-channel neural network architecture. This innovative architecture offers a versatile approach, exhibiting its efficacy in multidimensional settings through numerical examples and its robustness in handling initial values that have not been trained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of stable standing waves by considering the associated $L^2$-minimization problem. The presence of a doping profile causes a difficulty in the proof of the strict sub-additivity. A key ingredient is to establish the strict sub-additivity by adapting a scaling argument, which is inspired by \cite{ZZou}. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, smallness of some geometric quantity related to the domain ensures the existence of stable standing waves.</description>

Using a rigidity estimate by [Ciarlet-Mardare '15], existence of weak solutions is shown by means of a frame-indifferent time-discretization scheme. Further, the result includes viscous stress tensors which can be calculated by nonquadratic polynomial densities. Afterwards, we investigate the long-time behavior of solutions in the case of small external loading and initial data. Our main tool is the abstract theory of metric gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Sobolev and H\"older estimates for homotopy operators of the $\overline\partial$-equation on convex domains of finite multitype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct homotopy formulas for the $\overline\partial$-equation on convex domains of finite type that have optimal Sobolev and H\"older estimates. For a bounded smooth finite type convex domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb C^n$ that has $q$-type $m_q$ for $1\le q\le n$, our $\overline\partial$ solution operator $\mathcal H_q$ on $(0,q)$-forms has (fractional) Sobolev boundedness $\mathcal H_q:H^{s,p}\to H^{s+1/m_q,p}$ and H\"older-Zygmund boundedness $\mathcal H_q:\mathscr C^s\to\mathscr C^{s+1/m_q}$ for all $s\in\mathbb R$ and $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We also show the $L^p$-boundedness $\mathcal H_q:H^{s,p}\to H^{s,pr_q/(r_q-p)}$ for all $s\in\mathbb R$ and $1&lt;p&lt;r_q$, where $r_q:=(n-q+1)m_q+2q$.</description>

      <title>The spectral concentration for damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral distribution of damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds. Sj\"ostrand \cite{SJ1} proved that the imaginary parts of the majority of the eigenvalues concentrate near the average of the damping function, see also Anantharaman \cite{AN2}. In this paper, we prove that the most of eigenvalues actually lie in certain regions with imaginary parts that approach the average logarithmically as the real parts tend to infinity. The proof relies on the moderate deviation principles for Anosov geodesic flows. As an application, we show the concentration of non-trivial zeros of twisted Selberg zeta functions in a logarithmic region asymptotically close to $\Re s=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>
