      <title>A JWST MIRI LRS Survey of 37 Massive Star-Forming Galaxies and AGN at Cosmic Noon - Overview and First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a large spectroscopic survey with \textit{JWST}'s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) targeting $37$ infrared-bright galaxies between $z=0.65-2.46$ with infrared luminosities $\log L_{\rm IR}/L_\odot&gt;11.5$ and $\log M_*/M_\odot=10-11.5$. Targets were taken from a \textit{Spitzer} $24\,\mu$m-selected sample with archival spectroscopy from the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) and include a mix of star-forming galaxies and dust-obscured AGN. By combining IRS with the increased sensitivity of LRS, we expand the range of spectral features observed between $5-30\,\mu$m for every galaxy in our sample. In this paper, we outline the sample selection, \textit{JWST} data reduction, 1D spectral extraction, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature measurements from $\lambda_{rest}=3.3-11.2\,\mu$m. In the \textit{JWST} spectra, we detect PAH emission features at $3.3-5.3\,\mu$m, as well as Paschen and Brackett lines. The $3.3\,\mu$m feature can be as bright as $1\%$ of the $8-1000\,\mu$m infrared luminosity and exhibits a tight correlation with the dust-obscured star-formation rate. We detect absorption features from CO gas, CO$_2$ ice, H$_2$O ice, and aliphatic dust. From the joint \textit{JWST} and \textit{Spitzer} analysis we find that the $11.3/3.3\,\mu$m PAH ratios are on-average three times higher than that of local luminous, infrared galaxies. This is interpreted as evidence that the PAH grains are larger at $z\sim1-2$. The size distribution may be affected by coagulation of grains due to high gas densities and low temperatures. These conditions are supported by the observation of strong water ice absorption at $3.05\,\mu$m, and can lower stellar radiative feedback as large PAHs transmit less energy per photon into the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>RIGEL: Feedback regulated cloud-scale star formation efficiency in a simulated dwarf galaxy merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major mergers of galaxies are likely to trigger bursty star formation activities. The accumulation of dense gas and the boost of star formation efficiency (SFE) are considered to be the two main drivers of the starbursts. However, it is still unclear how each process operates on the scale of individual star-forming clouds. Here, we present a high-resolution (2 Msun) RHD simulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger using the RIGEL model to investigate how mergers affect the properties of the structure of dense star-forming gas and the cloud-scale SFE. We track the evolution of sub-virial dense clouds in the simulation by mapping them across successive snapshots taken at intervals of 0.2 Myr. We found that the merger triggers a 130 times higher SFR and shortens the galaxy-wide gas-depletion time by two orders of magnitude compared to those of two isolated galaxies. However, the depletion time of individual clouds and their lifetime distribution remained unchanged over the simulation period. The cloud life cycles and cloud-scale SFE are determined by the local stellar feedback rather than environmental factors regardless of the merger process, and the integrated SFE ($\epsilon_{\rm int}$) of clouds in complex environments is still well described by an $\epsilon_{\rm int}-\Sigma_{\rm tot}$ relation found in idealized isolated-cloud experiments. During the peak of the starburst, the median integrated SFE only changed by 0.17-0.33 dex lower compared to the value when the galaxies are not interacting. The merger boosts the SFR primarily through the accumulation and compression of dense gas fueling star formation. Strong tidal torques assemble $&gt;10^ 5$ Msun clouds that seed massive star clusters. The average separation between star-forming clouds decreases during the merger, which in turn decreases the cloud--cluster spatial decorrelation from &gt;1 kpc to 0.1 kpc depicted by tuning fork diagrams.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{geko}$: A tool for modelling galaxy kinematics and morphology in JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) is a powerful tool for studying large samples of galaxies across cosmic times. With the arrival of JWST, and its NIRCAM grism mode, slitless spectroscopy can reach a medium spectral resolution of $(R\sim 1600)$, allowing it to spatially resolve the ionised-gas kinematics out to $z\sim 9$. However, the kinematic information is convolved with morphology along the dispersion axis, a degeneracy that must be modelled to recover intrinsic properties. We present the Grism Emission-line Kinematics tOol ($\texttt{geko}$), a Python package that forward-models NIRCam grism observations and infers emission-line morphologies and kinematics within a Bayesian framework. $\texttt{geko}$ combines S\'ersic surface-brightness models with arctangent rotation curves, includes full point-spread function (PSF) and line-spread function (LSF) convolution, and leverages gradient-based sampling via $\texttt{jax}$/$\texttt{numpyro}$ for efficient inference. It recovers parameters such as effective radius, velocity dispersion, rotational velocity, rotational support, and dynamical mass, with typical run times of $\sim$20 minutes per galaxy on GPUs. We validate performance using extensive mock data spanning position angle, S/N, and morphology, quantifying where degeneracies limit recovery. Finally, we demonstrate applications to real FRESCO H$\alpha$ emitters at $z\approx 4-6$, recovering both rotation- and dispersion-dominated systems. $\texttt{geko}$ opens the way to statistical studies of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and is publicly available at https://github.com/angelicalola-danhaive/geko.</description>

      <title>The $M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$ Relationship at $3&lt;z&lt;7$: Big Black Holes in Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has identified a large population of faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early universe that are powered by black holes (BHs) that often appear overmassive relative to their host galaxies. In this study, we examine the relationship between BH mass and galaxy stellar mass at $3&lt;z&lt;7$ using a sample of 70 broad-line AGN identified using NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES surveys. Roughly half (43\%) of our sample appear heavily reddened and are classified as little red dots (LRDs). We estimate BH masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) using single-epoch virial techniques, while host stellar masses ($M_{\star}$) are inferred using a combination of two-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting and spectral energy distribution modeling. We find that a majority of our sources (50/70) have $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$ ratios that are 1-2 dex higher than that observed in AGN locally. Using a forward-modeling Bayesian framework that accounts for uncertainties, intrinsic scatter, and selection effects, we infer a $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ relationship that is $&gt;3\sigma$ above the relationship measured for local broad-line AGN. We derive an intrinsic scatter in this relationship of $0.9$ dex, which does not vary over the redshift range of our sample. We also find that the $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$ ratio increases by $2.3$ dex from $z = 3.5$ and $z = 6.5$ with a confidence level of $ &gt; 3\sigma$. We attribute this trend with the increasing fraction of LRDs in our sample at $z&gt;4$ as their host masses are $\sim1$ dex lower than the non-LRD AGN in our sample. These results support a picture in which the BHs powering JWST's broad-line AGN are genuinely overmassive and become increasingly so with redshift. We discuss the implications of our findings on early BH growth relative to that of their host galaxies and the constraints it places on BH seeding models.</description>

      <title>An extended and extremely thin gravitational arc from a lensed compact symmetric object at redshift 2.059</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are thought to be short-lived radio sources with two lobes of emission that are separated by less than a kpc in projection. However, studies of such systems at high redshift is challenging due to the limited resolution of present-day telescopes, and can be biased to the most luminous objects. Here we report imaging of a gravitationally lensed CSO at a redshift of 2.059 using very long baseline interferometry at 1.7 GHz. The data are imaged using Bayesian forward modelling deconvolution, which reveals a spectacularly extended and thin gravitational arc, and several resolved features within the lensed images. The surface brightness of the lensing-corrected source shows two mini-lobes separated by 642 pc in projection, with evidence of multiple hotspots that have brightness temperatures of 10^8.6 to 10^9.2 K, and a total luminosity density of 10^26.3 W / Hz. By combining the well-resolved radio source morphology with previous multi-wavelength studies, we conclude that this object is likely a CSO of type 2, and that the properties are consistent with the bow-shock model for compact radio sources. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining high quality data sets with sophisticated imaging and modelling algorithms for studying the high redshift Universe.</description>

      <title>The assembly of intermediate black holes with complementary approaches: Dragon II and BPop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) occupy the $ 10^2 - 10^5\,M_\odot $ range, but their existence remains poorly constrained. Only a few candidates have been suggested in dwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and LIGO-Virgo-Kagra detections. To investigate their formation and demographics, we adopt two complementary approaches. We first analyze the \textsc{dragonii} direct $N$-body simulations, which follow clusters with up to $ 10^6 $ stars, capture IMBHs growth. We then employ the semi-analytic code \textsc{bpop}, calibrated on \textsc{dragonii}, to explore a broad range of cluster and cosmological conditions.
  Our models reproduce merger rates consistent with GWTC-3, with $\sim30 - 60\%$ of BBHs forming dynamically, mainly in globular and nuclear clusters. About 2-3\% of mergers involve an IMBH, producing intermediate-mass ratio inspirals. The IMBH mass distribution spans $2.5 \times 10^2 - 4 \times 10^4\,M_\odot $, with rare growth beyond $10^6\,M_\odot$. Formation efficiency rises with initial binary fraction but declines in metal-rich environments. IMBHs thus emerge as a distinct population bridging stellar and supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Study of HI Turbulence in the SMC Using Multi-point Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) plays an important role in many physical processes, including forming stars and shaping complex ISM structures. In this work, we investigate the HI turbulent properties of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to reveal what physical mechanisms drive the turbulence and at what scales. Using the high-resolution HI data of the Galactic ASKAP (GASKAP) survey and multi-point structure functions (SF), we perform a statistical analysis of HI turbulence in 34 subregions of the SMC. Two-point SFs tend to show a linear trend, and their slope values are relatively uniform across the SMC, suggesting that large-scale structures exist and are dominant in the two-point SFs. On the other hand, seven-point SF enables us to probe small-scale turbulence by removing large-scale fluctuations, which is difficult to achieve with the two-point SFs. In the seven-point SFs, we find break features at scales of 34-84 pc, with a median scale of $\sim$50 pc. This result indicates the presence of small-scale turbulent fluctuations in the SMC and quantifies its scale. In addition, we find strong correlations between slope values of the seven-point SFs and the stellar feedback-related quantities (e.g., H$\alpha$ intensities, the number of young stellar objects, and the number of HI shells), suggesting that stellar feedback may affect the small-scale turbulent properties of the HI gas in the SMC. Lastly, estimated sonic Mach numbers across the SMC are subsonic, which is consistent with the fact that the HI gas of the SMC primarily consists of the warm neutral medium.</description>

      <title>A multiscale evolutionary study of molecular gas in STARFORGE. I. Synthetic observations of SEDIGISM-like molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular clouds are active sites of star formation in galaxies, and their formation and evolution are largely affected by stellar feedback. This includes outflows and winds from newly formed stars, radiation from young clusters, and supernova explosions. High-resolution molecular line observations allow for the identification of individual star-forming regions and the study of their integrated properties. Moreover, simulations are now capable of accurately replicating the evolution of MCs including all key stellar feedback processes. We present 13CO(2-1) synthetic observations of the STARFORGE simulations produced using the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D, matching the observational setup of the SEDIGISM survey. From these, we identified the population of MCs using hierarchical clustering and analysed them to provide insights into the interpretation of observed MCs as they evolve. The flux distributions of the post-processed synthetic observations and the properties of the MCs, namely radius, mass, velocity dispersion, virial parameter and surface density, are consistent with those of SEDIGISM. Both samples of MCs occupy the same regions in the scaling relation plots; however, the average distributions of MCs at different evolutionary stages do not overlap on the plots. This highlights the reliability of our approach in modelling SEDIGISM and suggests that MCs at different evolutionary stages contribute to the scatter in observed scaling relations. We study the trends in MC properties over time to analyse their physical structure as they evolve. MCs appear as small, diffuse cloudlets in early stages, followed by their evolution to filamentary structures, before being shaped by stellar feedback into 3D bubbles and getting dispersed. These trends in the observable properties of MCs provide strong evidence that clouds exhibit distinct morphologies over the course of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Unified Spectrospatial Forward Models: Spatially Continuous Maps of Weak Emission Lines in the Rosette Nebula with SDSS-V LVM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of IFU data are typically performed on a per-spaxel basis, with each spectrum modelled independently. For low signal-to-noise (S/N) features such as weak emission lines, estimating properties is difficult and imprecise. Arbitrary binning schemes boost S/N at the cost of resolution, and risk introducing biases. We present a general forward-modelling approach that assumes spectra close on the sky are more similar than distant ones, and so can be modelled jointly. These "spectrospatial" models exploit spatial correlation to provide robust inferences, while simultaneously providing continuous predictions of line properties like strength and kinematics across the sky. Instrumental and calibration systematics are straightforward to include and infer. The model provides a natural trade-off between spatial resolution and S/N in a data-driven way. We apply this to Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) data of the Rosette Nebula, producing continuous maps of fluxes and kinematics for Balmer, nebular, and auroral lines, as well as weak C II and N II recombination lines, demonstrating the approach across three orders of magnitude in S/N, including in the very low-S/N regime. The method recovers identical morphologies across different lines tracing similar ionisation volumes, at varying resolutions set by the S/N. We additionally provide a general framework for building and fitting such models in JAX, suitable for many applications. The implementation is fast and memory efficient, scales to large data volumes as in LVM, and can be deployed on hardware accelerators.</description>

      <title>The evolution of the bar fraction and bar lengths in the last 12 billion years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the bar fraction and length using an extended JWST NIRCam imaging dataset of galaxies in the $1 \leq z \leq 4$ redshift range. We assess the wavelength dependence of the bar fraction in disc galaxies and bar length evolution by selecting a nearly mass-complete CEERS disc sample and performing independent visual classifications on the short (F200W) and long (F356W+F444W) wavelength channels. A similar bar fraction is observed for both samples, and combined we find a declining trend in the bar fraction: $0.16^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ at $1 \leq z &lt; 2$; $0.08^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ at $2 \leq z &lt; 3$; $0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$ at $3 \leq z \leq 4$. This corroborates our previous work and other recent studies, suggesting that dynamically cold and rotationally supported massive discs are present at Cosmic Noon. No evolution in the F356W+F444W bar length is measured from $z = 4$ to $z = 1$, which has a mean of 3.6\,kpc, but a slight increase of about 1\,kpc towards $z = 1$ is measured in the F200W sample, which has a mean of 2.9\,kpc. The bar sample is shorter in the short-wavelength channel due to the better physical spatial resolution; however, we also suggest that dust obscuration plays a role. We find that the correlation between bar length and galaxy mass for massive galaxies observed at $z &lt; 1$ is not seen at $z &gt; 1$. By adding samples of barred galaxies at $z&lt;1$, we show that there is a modest increase in the bar length ($\approx 2$\,kpc) towards $z=0$, but bars longer than $\approx8$\,kpc are only found at $z&lt;1$. We show that bars and discs grow in tandem, for the bar length normalised by disc size does not evolve from $z = 4$ to $z = 0$. Not only is a significant population of bars forming beyond $z = 1$, but our results also show that some of these bars are as long and strong as the average bar at $z\approx0$.</description>

      <title>Is Liller 1 a building block of the Galactic bulge? - Evidence with APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liller 1 is a stellar system orbiting within the inner 0.8kpc of the Galactic centre, characterised by a wide spread in age and metallicity, indicating a high mass. Liller 1 has been proposed to be a major contributor to the stellar mass of the Galactic bulge, yet its origin is subject to debate. We employ Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) to test scenarios proposed to explain the nature of Liller 1. Using a random sampling technique, we contrast the chemical compositions of Liller 1 stellar members with those of the bulge, inner disc, outer disk and solar neighbourhood. The chemistry of Liller 1 deviates from that of the bulge population at the 2-3$\sigma$ level for $\alpha$-elements Mg, Si, and Ca. We conclude that the progenitor of Liller 1 was not a major contributor of stellar mass to the bulge. Furthermore, we find the abundance pattern of Liller 1 to deviate at the 2$\sigma$ level from that of inner disk stars, ruling out the cluster rejuvenation scenario. Finally, we find that Liller 1 is chemically distinct from solar and outer disc populations, suggesting that the progenitor of Liller 1 is unlikely to be an in-situ massive clump formed at high redshift, from disc gravitational instabilities, that migrated inwards and coalesced with others into the bulge. Finally, we suggest that Liller 1 is a minor contributor to the stellar mass of the inner Galaxy, possibly of extragalactic origin.</description>

      <title>LATIS: Galaxy-Environment Relations at Cosmic Noon and the Role of Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the environmental dependence of galaxy properties at $z\sim2.5$ using the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which provides high-resolution three-dimensional maps of intergalactic medium (IGM) overdensity via Ly$\alpha$ forest tomography. Our analysis focuses on a UV-selected spectroscopic sample of 2185 galaxies from LATIS and a complementary set of 1157 galaxies from heterogeneous spectroscopic surveys in the COSMOS field. We compare these datasets to forward-modeled mock catalogs constructed from the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulation, incorporating realistic selection functions to match both LATIS and the literature sample. While the mass-complete simulation predicts strong environmental trends--more massive and quiescent galaxies preferentially occupy overdense regions--we find that such trends are significantly weaker or absent in the observed samples. The LATIS galaxies show no measurable correlation between specific star formation rate (sSFR) and IGM overdensity, a result reproduced by LATIS-like mock catalogs, confirming that UV selection systematically excludes passive and dusty galaxies in dense environments. The literature compilation, despite improved high-mass coverage, remains incomplete and affected by similar biases. We also analyze a mass-complete photometric sample from the COSMOS-Web catalog at $z\sim2.5$ and find no detectable sSFR-environment relation, a null result that our simulations indicate can be explained by photometric redshift uncertainties. In particular, we find no evidence for a reversal of the sSFR-density relation at cosmic noon. These results demonstrate that observed correlations can be heavily shaped by selection effects, and caution against inferring physical trends from incomplete spectroscopic samples. Deeper, more representative spectroscopic surveys are needed to robustly characterize environmental effects at this epoch.</description>

      <title>Robust Measurement of Stellar Streams Around the Milky Way: Correcting Spatially Variable Observational Selection Effects in Optical Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of density variations in stellar streams are a promising probe of low-mass dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. However, survey systematics such as variations in seeing and sky brightness can also induce artificial fluctuations in the observed densities of known stellar streams. These variations arise because survey conditions affect both object detection and star-galaxy misclassification rates. To mitigate these effects, we use Balrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to calculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of survey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect to survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the synthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation of relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and our corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix stream when including faint objects. Additionally, for artificial streams with DES like survey properties we are able to recover density power spectra with reduced bias. We also find that uncorrected power-spectrum results for LSST-like data can be around five times more biased, highlighting the need for such corrections in future ground based surveys.</description>

      <title>Bar pattern speed modulation across LMC stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bar pattern speed of the LMC has been measured using Gaia data, suggesting the presence of a slow pattern, perhaps not rotating at all. Numerical simulations of interacting LMC-SMC systems were able to reproduce a bar stoppage. Here, we report on the first measurement of the bar pattern speed of the LMC as a function of the evolutionary phase of its stellar populations. Astrometric and photometric data of 11 million LMC stars from Gaia DR3 were used to build five evolutionary phases, from less to more evolved stars. The Dehnen method, a new procedure to derive bar pattern speeds from kinematics of particles in N-body simulations, is applied to the LMC stellar populations. We observe a modulation of the bar pattern speed with the evolutionary phase, meaning that different LMC stellar populations exhibit different pattern speeds, ranging from -0.9 to 6.6 km/s/kpc. Moreover, less evolved stars have a lower pattern speed while the bar of more evolved phases tends to rotate faster. The LMC bar is thus extremely slow, ruling out the presence of bar corotation within the disc, in agreement with a previous claim, but this time observed with various stellar populations. It is the first time that a pattern speed is measured separately for different stellar populations in any galaxy. The LMC pattern speed cannot be simply resumed to a singular value, but instead is an overlay of different patterns depending on the evolutionary phase of the stars. Future Gaia releases will be crucial to investigate more deeply the relations of the pattern speed with important astrophysical parameters of stars, like their age and metallicity, which will be helpful to constrain the chemo-dynamical evolution of the LMC bar.</description>

      <title>Composition of planetary debris around the white dwarf GD 362</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf stars with high abundances of heavy elements in their atmospheres and infrared excesses are believed to be accreting planetary material. GD 362 is one of the most heavily polluted white dwarfs and has an exceptionally strong mid-infrared excess, reprocessing 2.4% of the star's light into the mid-infrared. We present a high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution spectrum of GD 362 obtained with JWST, covering 0.6 to 17 microns, along with photometry out to 25.5 microns. The mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by an exceptionally strong 9 to 11 micron silicate feature, which can be explained by a combination of olivine and pyroxene silicate minerals. Grains such as carbon, hotter than silicates, are required to explain the near-infrared emission. The silicates and carbon reside in a disk from 140 to 1400 stellar radii, and the disk scale height is greater than half the stellar radius. The elemental abundances of the solid material, relative to Si, are within a factor of 2 of meteoritic (CI chondrites) for C, O, Mg, Al, and Fe, with Al elevated and O slightly depleted. A similar pattern is observed for the abundances of accreted material in the stellar photosphere. Hydrogen is an exception, because no significant H-bearing minerals or water were detected in the disk, despite a large H abundance in the photosphere.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Foundation Model for Cosmological Simulation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-modal foundation model for astrophysical galaxy data, designed to map between simulation- and observation-based galactic features. Our encoder-only transformer flexibly ingests scalar quantities (e.g., redshifts, galaxy masses) and vectors (e.g., star formation histories, spectra), supporting multi-task training that includes within-modality reconstruction and cross-modality prediction. With a dynamic masking strategy, the model can query arbitrary galaxy properties from partial inputs -- including predicting spectra from redshift and mass, or estimating photometric redshifts from broadband magnitudes -- while also recovering missing segments within a modality. Trained on 185,000 simulated galaxies from a gigaparsec-scale Cosmology simulation, the model yields a 50% improvement in redshift estimation when combining LSST and SPHEREx photometry over LSST photometry alone, and a 63% improvement in stellar mass inference when combining late-time SFH with LSST photometry over early-time SFH with LSST photometry. The model demonstrates strong generalization across multi-modal tasks and lays the groundwork for future integration of higher-dimensional and structured data such as images, merger trees, and 3D fields. This approach provides a unified framework for connecting simulations and observations, advancing the development of generalizable astrophysical foundation models.</description>

      <title>Inefficient dust production in a massive, metal-rich galaxy at $z=7.13$ uncovered by JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed a remarkably rapid buildup of cosmic dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) of high redshift galaxies, with complex dust compositions and large abundances already appearing at redshifts $z&gt;6$. Here we present a comprehensive, joint analysis of observations taken with the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) of the highly magnified, dusty `normal' galaxy, A1689-zD1 at $z=7.13$. We perform detailed spectro-photometric modeling of the rest-frame UV to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) based on archival photometry of the source and report new rest-frame optical strong-line measurements and metallicity estimates from recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data. We find that despite its substantial dust mass, $M_{\rm dust}\sim 1.5\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$, A1689-zD1 has remarkably low dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal mass ratios, ${\rm DTG} = (5.1^{+3.0}_{-1.9})\times 10^{-4}$ and ${\rm DTM} = (6.1^{+3.6}_{-2.3})\times 10^{-2}$, respectively, due to its high metallicity $12+\log({\rm O/H}) = 8.36\pm 0.10$ and substantial gas mass, $M_{\rm gas} = (2.8^{+0.2}_{-1.7})\times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$. The DTG and DTM mass ratios are an order of magnitude lower than expected for galaxies in the local universe with similar chemical enrichment. These low relative measurements are also corroborated by the deficit observed in the $A_V/N_{\rm HI}$ ratio of A1689-zD1 in the line-of-sight. We find that this deviation in the DTG and DTM mass ratios appears to be ubiquitous in other metal-rich galaxies at similar redshifts, $z\gtrsim 6$. This suggests that the processes that form and destroy dust at later times, or the dust emissivity itself, are drastically different for galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>CHILES X: Molecular and atomic gas at intermediate redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA CO observations of 14 HI-detected galaxies from the CHILES survey found in a cosmic over-density at z~0.12. This is the largest collection of spatially resolved CO + HI observations beyond the local Universe (z&gt;0.05) to date. While the HI-detected parent sample spans a range of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), and environments, we only directly detect CO in the highest stellar mass galaxies, log(M_*/M_Sun)&gt;10.0, with SFRs greater than ~2 M_Sun/yr. The detected CO has the kinematic signature of a rotating disk, consistent with the HI. We stack the CO non-detections and find a mean H_2 mass of log(M_H2/M_Sun) = 8.46 in galaxies with a mean stellar mass of log(M_*/M_Sun) = 9.35. In addition to high stellar masses and SFRs, the systems detected in CO are spatially larger, have redder overall colors, and exhibit broader (stacked) line widths. The CO emission is spatially coincident with both the highest stellar mass surface density and star forming region of the galaxies, as revealed by the 1.4 GHz continuum emission. We interpret the redder colors as the molecular gas being coincident with dusty regions of obscured star formation. The 14 HI detections show a range of morphologies, but the HI reservoir is always more extended than the CO. Finally, we compare with samples in the literature and find mild evidence for evolution in the molecular gas reservoir and H_2-to-HI gas ratio with redshift in HI flux-limited samples. We show that the scatter in the HI, and HI-to-stellar mass ratio is too great to conclusively measure evolution below z=0.2, and is even extremely difficult below z=0.4. Detections from CHILES are likely to be the only individual galaxies detected in HI between 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.23 for the foreseeable future due to the severity of satellite radio frequency interference, and its preferential impact on short baselines which dominate contemporary HI surveys.</description>

      <title>Observation of CH$_{3}$$^{17}$OH and CH$_{3}$$^{18}$OH in Orion KL: A New Tool to Study Star-Formation History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methanol is a seed species of complex organic molecules that is of fundamental importance in astrochemistry. Although various isotopologues of CH$_3$OH have been detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), CH$_{3}$$^{17}$OH is only tentatively detected in Sgr~B2. To confirm the presence of CH$_{3}$$^{17}$OH in the ISM and to investigate its abundance, we search for its emission lines in the Orion~KL region. We have obtained image cubes covering the frequency ranges 236.40~GHz-236.65~GHz and 231.68~GHz-231.88~GHz using ALMA archival data observed toward the Orion~KL region. The column densities of CH$_3$$^{17}$OH and CH$_3$$^{18}$OH are estimated under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium condition with fixed excitation temperatures at the two CH$_3$$^{18}$OH peaks, MeOH1 and MeOH2,. We have identified six emission lines of CH$_{3}$$^{17}$OH in MeOH1 and MeOH2 and confirmed that the line profiles and spatial distributions are consistent with those of CH$_3$$^{18}$OH. The abundance ratios of CH$_3$$^{18}$OH/CH$_3$$^{17}$OH are evaluated to be $\sim 3.4-3.5$ and are similar to the canonical value of $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O $\sim 3-4$ derived from CO observations in the Orion~KL region. We have compared the results with the previous study of CH$_3$OH and evaluated CH$_3$$^{16}$OH/CH$_3$$^{17}$OH ratios to be $\sim 2300-2500$ at a resolution of $\sim 4$~arcsec. The ratios are close to the $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O ratio in the local ISM. This result indicates that the CH$_3$OH isotopologues can serve as new tracers of oxygen isotope ratios in star-forming regions because the opacity of CH$_3$OH can be evaluated using transition lines spanning a wide range of line intensities. Moreover, this method enables us to study the star-formation history of our Galaxy with the aid of the Galactic chemical evolution models.</description>

      <title>Questing a Coherent Definition of Weak-line Quasars and its Physical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak-line quasars (WLQs) are a subset of type 1 quasars with remarkably weak high-ionization broad emission lines but normal optical/UV continua. Using 371,091 quasars from SDSS DR16, we define WLQs by analyzing outliers in three relations: the L1350-CIV blueshift, the Baldwin effect, and the logL2500-alpha_ox. We find two CIV EW thresholds: $8.9\pm0.2${\AA} and $19.3\pm0.3${\AA}. WLQs (EW(CIV)&lt;$8.9\pm0.2${\AA}) have enhanced CIV blueshifts, deviate from the Baldwin effect, and include many X-ray weak objects (nearly half). Normal quasars (EW(CIV)&gt;$19.3\pm0.3${\AA}) show typical properties, while bridge quasars (intermediate EW) are transitional. WLQs show a positive correlation between line attenuation and ionization energy: high-ionization lines (e.g., HeII, CIV) are suppressed by ~3-4{\sigma} compared to low-ionization lines (e.g., MgII, OI). This supports the shielding gas model, where a thick inner accretion disk obscures high-energy photons, suppressing high-ionization lines, while low-ionization lines are less affected. We suggest that WLQs and normal quasars correspond to slim and thin disk regimes, respectively, with bridge quasars as a transitional phase. This work provides a unified criterion for WLQs and highlights the role of accretion-driven shielding gas in their spectral features.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Halo Clustering on Subhalo Anisotropy and Planarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that host cold dark matter (CDM) haloes cluster in a manner that depends upon the anisotropy/planarity of their subhaloes, indicating an environmental dependence to subhalo anisotropy/planarity. The spatial distribution of satellite galaxies about central galaxies and correspondingly, the spatial distribution of subhaloes about host haloes have been subjects of interest for two decades. Important questions include the degree to which satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts or exhibit planarity in their distributions and the degree to which this anisotropy depends upon the environment of the host-satellite system. We study the spatial distributions of subhaloes in a cosmological N-body simulation. We find that CDM subhaloes are distributed in a manner that is strongly anisotropic/planar, in agreement with prior work, though our presentation is complementary. The more novel result is that this anisotropy has an environmental dependence. Systems which exhibit less (more) anisotropy and less (more) planarity cluster more strongly (weakly). Systems in which subhaloes reside further from their host centres cluster more weakly. None of these clustering effects are caused by a correlation between subhalo anisotropy/planarity and other properties on which host halo clustering is known to depend, such as concentration, spin parameter, host halo shape, or subhalo count. We discuss the impact of this result on the anisotropy of satellites as predicted by CDM, its testability, and its possible relation to anisotropy observed about the large galaxies of the Local Group.</description>

      <title>MOLLId: software for automatic identification of spectral molecular lines in the sub-millimeter and millimeter bands and its application to the spectra of protostars from the region RCW 120</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the program MOLLId (MOLecular Line Identification) for automated molecular lines approximation with gaussian profile. Molecular identification was performed using multi-level comparison of the lines' center frequencies and rest frequencies from the spectroscopic database. The program was tested using identification of the molecular lines in observational spectra of young stellar objects RCW 120 YSO S1 and RCW 120 YSO S2, located near the border of the RCW 120 PDR. In the spectra of the RCW 120 YSO S1 source, 100 lines of 41 molecules were identified over the level of 4-6 sigma. In the spectra of the RCW 120 YSO S2 source, 407 lines of 79 molecules were identified over the level 3-5 sigma. Using Intel Core i7-12700K CPU, identification time is equal to 6 and 8 minutes per spectral range for the YSOs S1 and S2, respectively. From the analysis of CH3OH, CH3CN, CH3CCH molecules identified in RCW 120 YSO S2 we found a two-component structure and estimated the physical parameters in the LTE approximation for each of the components.</description>

      <title>Probing viscosity of the intracluster medium using ram-pressure stripping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies falling into galaxy clusters can leave imprints on both the corona of galaxies and the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. Throughout this infall process, the galaxy's atmosphere is subjected to ram pressure from a headwind, leading to the stripping morphology observed in its tail. The morphological evolution is affected by the properties of the surrounding ICM such as magnetic fields and viscosity. In this Letter, we perform 3D Braginskii-magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code with varied ICM viscosity models. Specifically, we explore four models: an inviscid case, unsuppressed isotropic viscosity, unsuppressed anisotropic viscosity, and anisotropic viscosity suppressed by plasma instabilities. Our findings indicate that the isotropic viscosity case effectively suppresses hydrodynamic instabilities and shows strong viscous heating and the least mixing with the ICM, enabling the formation of long, coherent tails. The inviscid model has the shortest tail due to vigorous mixing, and the models with anisotropic viscosity are in between. The model with suppressed anisotropic viscosity due to plasma instabilities exhibits enhanced turbulence in the galactic tail and a concurrent limitation in viscous heating compared to the model neglecting plasma instabilities. These findings highlight the significant impact of ICM plasma physics on the processes of ram pressure stripping of galaxies.</description>

      <title>A first look at quasar-galaxy clustering at $z\simeq7.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST observations of the environments surrounding two high-redshift quasars -- J0252$-$0503 at $z = 7.0$ and J1007$+$2115 at $z = 7.5$ -- which enable the first constraints on quasar-galaxy clustering at $z \sim 7.3$. Galaxies in the vicinity of the quasars are selected through ground-based and JWST/NIRCam imaging and then spectroscopically confirmed with JWST/NIRSpec using the multi-shutter assembly (MSA). Over both fields, we identify 51 $z&gt;5$ galaxies, of which eight are found within a $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}}=\pm1500 \rm{km} \rm{s}^{-1}$ line-of-sight velocity window from the quasars and another eight in the background. The galaxy J0252\_8713, located just $7\,\rm{pkpc}$ and $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}} \approx 360\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ from quasar J0252$-$0503, emerges as a compelling candidate for one of the most distant quasar-galaxy mergers. Combining the galaxy discoveries over the two fields, we measure the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation and obtain a correlation length of $r_0^{\rm{QG}}\approx7.6_{-1.6}^{+1.7}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, based on a power-law model with a fixed slope of $\gamma_{\rm{QG}} = 2.0$. Under the assumption that quasars and galaxies trace the same underlying dark matter density fluctuations, we infer a minimum dark matter halo mass for $z\simeq7.3$ quasars of $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot})= 11.6\pm0.6$ in a halo model framework. Compared to measurements from EIGER at $\langle z \rangle = 6.25$ and ASPIRE at $\langle z \rangle = 6.7$ (where $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot}) \gtrsim 12.3$), our clustering results provide tentative evidence for a non-monotonic redshift evolution of quasar clustering properties. We further estimate a quasar duty cycle of $f_{\rm{duty}}\approx0.1\%$, consistent with constraints from quasar proximity zones and IGM damping wings. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshift Estimation for Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 with Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic analysis of photometric redshifts (photo-z) estimated from the Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) data taken with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Commissioning Camera. Employing the Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL) framework, we apply eight photo-z algorithms to the DP1 photometry, using deep ugrizy coverage in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) field and griz data in the Rubin_SV_38_7 field. In the ECDFS field, we construct a reference catalog from spectroscopic redshift (spec-z), grism redshift (grism-z), and multiband photo-z for training and validating photo-z. Performance metrics of the photo-z are evaluated using spec-zs from ECDFS and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 samples. Across the algorithms, we achieve per-galaxy photo-z scatter of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \sim 0.03$ and outlier fractions around 10% in the 6-band data, with performance degrading at faint magnitudes and z&gt;1.2. The overall bias and scatter of our machine-learning based photo-zs satisfy the LSST Y1 requirement. We also use our photo-z to infer the ensemble redshift distribution n(z). We study the photo-z improvement by including near-infrared photometry from the Euclid mission, and find that Euclid photometry improves photo-z at z&gt;1.2. Our results validate the RAIL pipeline for Rubin photo-z production and demonstrate promising initial performance.</description>

      <title>Stacking 21-cm Maps around Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters during Reionization: Prospects for a Cross-correlation Detection with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the redshifted 21-cm line during the Epoch of Reionization will open a new window to probe the intergalactic medium during the formation of the first stars, galaxies, and black holes. A particularly promising route to an initial detection is to cross-correlate tomographic 21-cm maps with spectroscopically confirmed Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). High-redshift LAEs preferentially reside in ionized bubbles that are strongly anticorrelated with the surrounding neutral regions traced by 21-cm observations. In this work, we study the prospect of detecting such a cross-correlation signal by stacking 21-cm image cubes around LAEs using a current-generation 21-cm instrument -- the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). Our forecast adopts a realistic mapping pipeline to generate foreground-free 21-cm image cubes. The statistical properties of these images, arising from the complex instrumental response, are carefully accounted for. We further introduce a physically motivated signal template calibrated on the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which connects the cross-correlation amplitude to the global neutral fraction. Our results show that a sample of ~50 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs is sufficient to begin constraining the reionization history. These results represent an important preparatory step toward joint analyses of 21-cm experiments with upcoming wide-area, high-redshift galaxy surveys from Euclid and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>A million-solar-mass object detected at cosmological distance using gravitational imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure on sub-galactic scales provides important tests of galaxy formation models and the nature of dark matter. However, such objects are typically too faint to provide robust mass constraints. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely low-mass object detected via its gravitational perturbation to a thin lensed arc observed with milli-arcsecond-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The object was identified using a non-parametric gravitational imaging technique and confirmed using independent parametric modelling. It contains a mass of $m_{\rm 80}=(1.13 \pm 0.04)\times 10^6{M_\odot}$ within a projected radius of 80 parsecs at an assumed redshift of 0.881. This detection is extremely robust and precise, with a statistical significance of 26$\sigma$, a 3.3 per cent fractional uncertainty on $m_{\rm 80}$, and an astrometric uncertainty of 194 $\mu$as. This is the lowest-mass object known to us, by two orders of magnitude, to be detected at a cosmological distance by its gravitational effect. This work demonstrates the observational feasibility of using gravitational imaging to probe the million-solar-mass regime far beyond our local Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars orbiting Sgr A* at the Milky Way's center provide a unique laboratory to test gravity and dark matter (DM). We demonstrate that DM interactions in stellar interiors induce a novel momentum transfer force, altering orbits beyond gravitational effects. Using S2's 2000-2019 orbital data we derive the first astrophysical constraints on DM-nucleon scattering, excluding new sub-GeV parameter space. Stellar lifetime constraints over Myr timescales complement these, surpassing some direct detection and cosmological limits. This establishes stellar dynamics as a novel probe of DM interactions.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the state of the evidence for the existence and observational appearance of supermassive black hole binaries. Such objects are expected from standard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each containing a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger remnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in the host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively accreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples of dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales. Signatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in jetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy significantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to uncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers. Before the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to detect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries. The first signs of the combined background of inspiralling objects might have been seen already.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the evolution of the CO excitation ladder through cross-correlation of CONCERTO-like experiments and galaxy redshift surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Rotational CO transitions, while acting as a foreground for [C II] line-intensity mapping (LIM) experiments, trace the physical conditions of cold gas in galaxies at lower redshifts. Studying these transitions is also crucial for improving component-separation methods as LIM sensitivity increases. Aims: Galaxy-evolution models have so far predicted only the total CO LIM signal. We explore the potential of cross-correlating millimeter-wave LIM data with spectroscopic galaxy surveys to constrain individual CO-line contributions, measure the CO-background spectral line energy distribution (SLED), and derive the cosmic molecular gas density, $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}(z)$, up to $z = 3$. Methods: We built 12 light cones of $9~\mathrm{deg}^2$ from the Simulated Infrared Extragalactic Sky (SIDES) simulation. By analyzing cross-power spectra between different CO transitions and the galaxy density field, we recovered the CO background SLED. Combining it with bias-weighted line intensities yielded $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}(z)$. We also assessed the detectability of the CO(4--3) cross-power spectrum with a CONCERTO-like experiment. Results: For a realistic spectroscopic depth, the CO background SLED is accurately recovered up to $J_{\mathrm{up}} = 6$ with $\leq 20%$ uncertainties. Reconstructing $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ from millimeter LIM data requires an excitation correction relative to CO(1--0). Interloper-induced variance does not prevent precise $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ estimation. In the two-star-formation-mode SIDES model, starbursts dominate the SLED at $J_{\mathrm{up}} \geq 6$ but do not bias $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ estimates from $2 \leq J_{\mathrm{up}} \leq 6$. However, CONCERTO lacks the sensitivity to detect the CO$\times$galaxy cross-power on relevant scales, even under ideal conditions.</description>

      <title>Testing Lens Models of PLCK G165.7+67.0 Using Lensed SN H0pe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova H0pe is a multiply-imaged Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and the second lensed SN to yield a measurement of the Hubble constant by the time-delay cosmography method, finding $H_0 = 75.4^{+8.1}_{-5.5} \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We investigate the seven lens modeling approaches used to derive $H_0$, assessing their agreement with $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ constraints from SN Ia surveys through a purely observational comparison. While photometrically derived magnifications yield distance moduli in line with $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ expectations, our comparison reveals that lens model predictions, even the most precise ones, consistently overestimate the magnification, with a offset of $ \Delta \mu &gt; 1$ mag. This known bias, already appreciated by modeling teams, is independently confirmed through our analysis and highlights the value of lensed SNe as a tool to test model accuracy. If unaccounted for, such magnification biases can propagate into uncertainties in derived cosmological parameters, including $H_0$, and affect the interpretation of future precision measurements. These findings highlight a critical challenge for precision cosmology using strongly lensed transients. With next-generation surveys such as LSST, Roman, and Euclid poised to discover many more gravitationally lensed supernovae, the development and validation of robust, accurate lens models will be essential for using these rare events to probe cosmology.</description>

      <title>Classification for 969 double-mode RR Lyrae stars from Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RR Lyrae (RRL) variable stars are cornerstone distance indicators. In particular, double-mode RR Lyrae (RRd) stars enable period--luminosity relations (PLRs) that are less sensitive to metallicity, reducing systematic biases in distance measurements. However, their utility has been limited by a global sample of only $\sim$3,000 objects. We develop an automated RRd-screening pipeline and apply it to a cross-matched sample between the Gaia DR3 RRL catalog and ZTF DR22 time-series photometry. The workflow combines Lomb--Scargle period searches, iterative pre-whitening, period-ratio constraints that suppress $\sim$1-day sampling aliases, and amplitude-based quality cuts, enabling large-scale RRd star screening. We produce two ZTF-based catalogs: (i) 39,322 reliable single-mode RRL (40.5\% of the cross-matched set) and (ii) 969 RRd stars. Among the RRd stars, 614 objects are newly identified, substantially enlarging this previously scarce sample; the catalog achieves an estimated completeness of 47.7\%. The PLR derived from the newly discovered RRd stars agrees with the LMC-based relation, though with larger uncertainties. Incorporating these stars will help tighten the RRd PLR and improve distance measurements. Looking ahead, systematic RRd searches with upcoming surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) should further extend high-accuracy distances across the Local Group and strengthen their cosmological applications.</description>

Abstract: JWST's exquisite data have opened the doors to new possibilities in detecting broad classes of astronomical objects, but also to new challenges in classifying those objects. In this work, we introduce SESHAT, the Stellar Evolutionary Stage Heuristic Assessment Tool for the identification of Young Stellar Objects, field stars (main sequence through asymptotic giant branch), brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, and galaxies, from any JWST observation. This identification is done using the machine learning method XGBoost to analyze thousands of rows of synthetic photometry, modified at run-time to match the filters available in the data to be classified. We validate this tool on real data of both star-forming regions and cosmological fields, and find we are able to reproduce the observed classes of objects to a minimum of 80\% recall across every class, without additional information on the ellipticity or spatial distribution of the objects. Furthermore, this tool can be used to test the filter choices for JWST proposals, to verify whether the chosen filters are sufficient to identify the desired class of objects. SESHAT is released as a Python package to the community for general use.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational lensing time delays with quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational fields of astrophysical bodies bend the light around them, creating multiple paths along which light from a distant source can arrive at Earth. Measuring the difference in photon arrival time along these different paths provides a means of determining the mass of the lensing system, which is otherwise difficult to constrain. This is particularly challenging in the case of microlensing, where the images produced by lensing cannot be individually resolved; existing proposals for detecting time delays in microlensed systems are significantly constrained due to the need for large photon flux and the loss of signal coherence when the angular diameter of the light source becomes too large.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach to measuring astrophysical time delays. Our method uses exponentially fewer photons than previous schemes, enabling observations that would otherwise be impossible. Our approach, which combines a quantum-inspired algorithm and quantum information processing technologies, saturates a provable lower bound on the number of photons required to find the time delay. Our scheme has multiple applications: we explore its use both in calibrating optical interferometric telescopes and in making direct mass measurements of ongoing microlensing events. To demonstrate the latter, we present a fiducial example of microlensed stellar flares sources in the Galactic Bulge. Though the number of photons produced by such events is small, we show that our photon-efficient scheme opens the possibility of directly measuring microlensing time delays using existing and near-future ground-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Misalignments of Eccentric Black Hole Mergers in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a natural environment where stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can dynamically pair, undergo repeated interactions, and eventually merge. It is commonly assumed that gas accretion will both efficiently spin up disk-embedded black holes and align the orbits of embedded binaries with the disk plane, leading to mergers with preferentially positive effective spin parameters ($\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Such predictions have motivated the use of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a diagnostic for identifying candidate AGN-embedded mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave catalog. In this work, we perform post-Newtonian $N$-body simulations of nearly planar binary-single encounters and apply an empirically motivated, gas-driven alignment prescription to characterize the expected $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$-eccentricity correlations of AGN-embedded mergers. By comparing the alignment and gravitational-wave inspiral timescales, we identify the regions of parameter space, across both disk location and binary properties, where full disk-spin-orbit alignment is effective and where it is not. We find that quasi-circular binaries typically align by the time they merge, supporting the standard picture of spin-orbit aligned orientations. By contrast, eccentric binaries (with in-band eccentricity $e_{10\mathrm{Hz}}\gtrsim 0.1$) typically inspiral too quickly for gas torques to act, preserving the post-encounter spin-orbit misalignments and yielding more isotropic $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distributions when disk densities and torque efficiencies are modest. This interplay naturally establishes a correlation between binary eccentricity and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ in AGN disks, highlighting a new key observable of the AGN channel and a potential explanation for massive events such as GW190521 and GW231123.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Influence of Radiative Feedback in Bright-Rimmed Cloud 44</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative feedback from massive stars plays a central role in the evolution of molecular clouds and the interstellar medium. This paper presents a multi-wavelength analysis of the bright-rimmed cloud, BRC 44, which is located at the periphery of the Hii region Sh2-145 and is excited by the massive stars in the region. We use a combination of archival and newly obtained infrared data, along with new optical observations, to provide a census of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region and to estimate stellar parameters such as age, mass etc. The spatial distribution of YSOs visible in the optical wavelength suggests that they are distributed in separate clumps compared to the embedded YSOs and are relatively older. Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of four YSOs in this region using the TANSPEC mounted on the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) confirms their youth. From Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting, most of the embedded YSO candidates are in their early stage of evolution, with the majority of them in their Class II and some in Class I stage. The relative proper motions of the YSOs with respect to the ionizing source are indicative of the rocket effect in the BRC. The 12CO, 13CO, and C18O observations with the Purple Mountain Observatory are used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the region. A comparison of the cold molecular gas distribution with simple analytical model calculations shows that the cloud is in the compression stage, and massive stars may be influencing the formation of young embedded stars in the BRC region due to radiative feedback.</description>

      <title>Mephisto: Self-Improving Large Language Model-Based Agents for Automated Interpretation of Multi-band Galaxy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical research has long relied on human expertise to interpret complex data and formulate scientific hypotheses. In this study, we introduce Mephisto -- a multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates human-like reasoning for analyzing multi-band galaxy observations. Mephisto interfaces with the CIGALE codebase (a library of spectral energy distribution, SED, models) to iteratively refine physical models against observational data. It conducts deliberate reasoning via tree search, accumulates knowledge through self-play, and dynamically updates its knowledge base. Validated across diverse galaxy populations -- including the James Webb Space Telescope's recently discovered "Little Red Dot" galaxies -- we show that Mephisto demonstrates proficiency in inferring the physical properties of galaxies from multi-band photometry, positioning it as a promising research copilot for astronomers. Unlike prior black-box machine learning approaches in astronomy, Mephisto offers a transparent, human-aligned reasoning process that integrates seamlessly with existing research practices. This work underscores the possibility of LLM-driven agent-based research for astronomy, establishes a foundation for fully automated, end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-powered scientific workflows, and unlocks new avenues for AI-augmented discoveries in astronomy.</description>

      <title>BASILISK III. Stress-testing the Conditional Luminosity Function model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Conditional Luminosity Function (CLF) is an effective and flexible way of characterizing the galaxy-halo connection. However, it is subject to a particular choice for its parametrization, which acts as a prior assumption. Most studies have been restricted to what has become a standard CLF parametrization with little to no variation. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether this model is sufficient to fully characterize the small-scale data extracted from spectroscopic surveys and to gauge how adding or removing degrees of freedom impact the inference regarding the galaxy-halo connection. After extensive validation with realistic mock data, we use Basilisk, a highly constraining Bayesian hierarchical tool to model the kinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies, to test the standard CLF model against a slew of more flexible variants. In particular, we test whether the SDSS data favour any of these variants in terms of a goodness-of-fit improvement, and identify the models that are sufficiently flexible, beyond which additional model freedom is not demanded by the data. We show that some of these additional degrees of freedom, which have hitherto not been considered, result in a drastic improvement of the fit and cause significant changes in the inferred galaxy-halo connection. This highlights that an empirical model comes with an implicit prior about the parametrization form, which needs to be addressed to ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to capture the complexity of the data and to safeguard against a biased inference.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark dipole radiation on eccentric supermassive black hole binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation, and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.</description>

      <title>Introducing the THESAN-ZOOM project: radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of high-redshift galaxies with a multi-phase interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of $14$ high-redshift ($z&gt;3$) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with $M_\mathrm{halo} \approx 10^8 - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=3$. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of $142~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a gravitational softening length of $17~\mathrm{cpc}$. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises $60$ simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from $z=3-14$. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Characterization of Galaxy-cool CGM Connections at $z&lt;0.4$ with DESI Year 1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationships between the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM), traced by Ca II absorption lines, and galaxy properties at $z&lt;0.4$ using $\sim900{,}000$ galaxy-quasar pairs within $200\,\rm kpc$ from the Year 1 data of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). This large data set enables us to obtain composite spectra with sensitivity reaching to the $\text{m\r{A}}$ level and to explore the Ca II absorption as a function of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), redshift, and galaxy types, including active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our results show a positive correlation between the absorption strength and stellar mass of star-forming galaxies with $\langle W_{0}^{\rm Ca\ II}\rangle \propto M_{*}^{0.5}$ over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass from $\sim 10^{8}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, while such a mass dependence is weaker for quiescent galaxies. At a fixed mass, Ca II absorption is stronger around star-forming galaxies than quiescent ones especially within impact parameters $&lt;30\,\rm kpc$. Among star-forming galaxies, the Ca II absorption further correlates with SFR, following $\propto \mathrm{SFR^{0.3}}$. However, in contrast to the results at higher redshifts, stronger absorption is not preferentially observed along the minor axis of star-forming galaxies, indicating a possible redshift evolution of CGM dynamics resulting from galactic feedback. Moreover, no significant difference between the properties of the cool gas around AGNs and galaxies is detected. Finally, we measure the absorption profiles with respect to the virial radius of dark matter halos and show that the total Ca II mass in the CGM is comparable to the Ca mass in the ISM of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Conditional Autoencoder for Generating Binary Neutron Star Waveforms with Tidal and Precession Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers provide critical insights into dense matter physics and strong-field gravity, yet accurate waveform modeling remains computationally intensive. We present a deep generative model for gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers that captures the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases while incorporating spin precession and tidal effects. Using a conditional autoencoder architecture, the model efficiently produces high-fidelity waveforms across a broad parameter space, including component masses (m1, m2), spin components (S1x, S1y, S1z, S2x, S2y, S2z), and tidal deformabilities (Lambda1, Lambda2). Trained on 1*10^6 waveforms generated by the IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2 model, our network achieves a mean mismatch of 2.13*10^-3. The generation time for a single waveform is 0.12 s, compared to 0.66 s for IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2, representing a speedup of about fivefold. When generating 1000 waveforms, the model completes the task in 0.75 s, roughly ten times faster than the baseline. This significant acceleration facilitates rapid parameter estimation and real-time gravitational-wave searches. With improved precision and efficiency, the model can support low-latency detection and broader applications in multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Mergers all the way down: stellar collisions and kinematics of a dense hierarchically forming massive star cluster in a dwarf starburst</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate that the progenitors of globular clusters (GCs) at high redshifts had high average stellar surface densities above $10^5\, \mathrm{M}_\odot\, \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$. The internal structure and kinematics of the clusters, however, remain out of reach. Numerical simulations are necessary to decipher the origin of spatio-kinematic features in present-day GCs. Here we study star cluster formation in a star-by-star hydrodynamical simulation of a low-metallicity starburst in a merger of two gas-rich dwarf galaxies. The simulation accounts for the multiphase interstellar medium, stellar radiation, winds and supernovae, and the accurate small-scale gravitational dynamics near massive stars. We also include prescriptions for stellar collisions and tidal disruption events by black holes. Gravitationally bound star clusters up to $\sim2\times10^5\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ form dense with initial half-mass radii of $\sim0.1\unicode{x2013}1\, \mathrm{pc}$. The most massive cluster approaches the observed high-redshift surface densities throughout its hierarchical and dissipative assembly. The cluster also hosts a collisionally growing very massive star of $\sim1000\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ that will eventually collapse, forming an intermediate mass black hole. The assembly leaves an imprint in the spatio-kinematic structure of the cluster. The youngest stars are more centrally concentrated, they show significant bulk rotation and have radially biased velocity components at outer radii. The older population is more round in shape, rotates slowly, its velocity distribution is isotropic and exhibits higher dispersion. If chemically enriched star formation proceeds mainly in the later stages of cluster assembly, these results provide a possible explanation for some of the multiple population features observed in dynamically young GCs.</description>

      <title>DESI Emission-line Galaxies: Clustering Dependence on Stellar Mass and [OII] Luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the projected two-point correlation functions of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) One-Percent Survey and model their dependence on stellar mass and [OII] luminosity. We select $\sim$180,000 ELGs with redshifts of $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$ and define 27 samples according to cuts in redshift and both galaxy properties. Following a framework that describes the conditional [OII] luminosity-stellar mass distribution as a function of halo mass, we simultaneously model the clustering measurements of all samples at fixed redshift. Based on the modeling result, most ELGs in our samples are classified as central galaxies, residing in halos of a narrow mass range with a typical median of $\sim$10$^{12.2-12.4}$ $h^{-1} M_\odot$. We observe a weak dependence of clustering amplitude on stellar mass, which is reflected in the model constraints and is likely a consequence of the 0.5 dex measurement uncertainty in the stellar mass estimates. The model shows a trend between galaxy bias and [OII] luminosity at high redshift ($1.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$) that is otherwise absent at lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>Auriga Superstars: Improving the resolution and fidelity of stellar dynamics in cosmological galaxy simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have become an indispensable tool to understand galaxies. However, computational constraints still severely limit their numerical resolution. This not only restricts the sampling of the stellar component and its direct comparison to detailed observations, but also the precision with which it is evolved. To overcome these problems we introduce the \emph{Superstars} method. This method increases the stellar mass resolution in cosmological galaxy simulations in a computationally inexpensive way for a fixed dark matter and gas resolution without altering any global properties of the simulated galaxies. We demonstrate the \emph{Superstars} method for a Milky Way-like galaxy of the Auriga project, improving the stellar mass resolution by factors of $8$ and $64$ at an additional cost of only $10\%$ and $500\%$, respectively. We show and quantify that this improves the sampling of the stellar population in the disc and halo without changing the properties of the central galaxy or its satellites, unlike simulations that change the resolution of all components (gas, dark matter, stars). Moreover, the better stellar mass resolution reduces numerical heating of the stellar disc in its outskirts and keeps substructures in the stellar disc and inner halo more coherent. It also makes lower mass and lower surface brightness structures in the stellar halo more visible. The \emph{Superstars} method is straightforward to incorporate in any cosmological galaxy simulation that does not resolve individual stars.</description>

      <title>FIELDMAPS Data Release: Far-Infrared Polarization in the "Bones" of the Milky Way</title>

Abstract: Polarization observations of the Milky Way and many other spiral galaxies have found a close correspondence between the orientation of spiral arms and magnetic field lines on scales of hundreds of parsecs. This paper presents polarization measurements at 214 $\mu$m toward ten filamentary candidate ``bones" in the Milky Way using the High-resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera (HAWC+) on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). These data were taken as part of the Filaments Extremely Long and Dark: A Magnetic Polarization Survey (FIELDMAPS) and represent the first study to resolve the magnetic field in spiral arms at parsec scales. We describe the complex yet well-defined polarization structure of all ten candidate bones, and we find a mean difference and standard deviation of $-74^{\circ} \pm 32^{\circ}$ between their filament axis and the plane-of-sky magnetic field, closer to a field perpendicular to their length rather than parallel. By contrast, the 850 $\mu$m polarization data from \textit{Planck} on scales greater than 10 pc show a nearly parallel mean difference of $3^{\circ} \pm 21^{\circ}$. These findings provide further evidence that magnetic fields can change orientation at the scale of dense molecular clouds, even along spiral arms. Finally, we use a power law to fit the dust polarization fraction as a function of total intensity on a cloud-by-cloud basis and find indices between $-0.6$ and $-0.9$, with a mean and standard deviation of $-0.7 \pm 0.1$. The polarization, dust temperature, and column density data presented in this work are publicly available online.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Galaxies at the Extremes: Failed Galaxy Progenitors in the MAGNETICUM Simulations</title>

Abstract: There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.</description>

      <title>How do uncertainties in galaxy formation physics impact field-level galaxy bias?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our ability to extract cosmological information from galaxy surveys is limited by uncertainties in the galaxy-dark matter halo relationship for a given galaxy population, which are governed by the intricacies of galaxy formation. To quantify these uncertainties, we examine quenched and star-forming galaxies using two distinct approaches to modeling galaxy formation: UniverseMachine, an empirical semianalytic model, and the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a second-order hybrid N-body perturbative bias expansion to each galaxy sample, enabling direct comparison of modeling approaches and revealing how uncertainties in the galaxy-halo connection affect bias parameters and non-Poisson noise across number densities and redshifts. Notably, we find that quenched and star-forming galaxies occupy distinct parts of the bias parameter space, and that the scatter induced from these different galaxy formation models is small when conditioned on similar selections of galaxies. We also detect the signature of assembly bias in our samples; this leads to small but significant deviations from analytic bias predictions, while assembly bias-removed samples match these predictions well. This work indicates that galaxy samples from a spectrum of reasonable, physically motivated models for galaxy formation give a relatively small range of field-level galaxy bias parameters. We estimate a set of priors from these models that should be useful in extracting cosmological constraints from luminous red galaxy- and emission line galaxy-like samples. Looking forward, careful estimates of the range of impacts of galaxy formation, for a given sample and cosmological analysis, will be an essential ingredient for extracting the most precise cosmological information from current and future large galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal O(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to the critical impact parameter obtained in hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution ${\rm d} M/{\rm d}E$ and fallback rate ${\rm d} M/{\rm d} T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Feature Intensity Mapping: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission from All Galaxies Across Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the aggregate emission of a spectral line from all sources, without requiring individual detections. Through the wavelength--redshift relation, one can map the line-of-sight evolution of the line emission that traces the underlying large-scale structure in a spectral-imaging survey. In this work, we present a new technique -- feature intensity mapping -- as an extension of the LIM formalism to map broad spectral features in 3D, rather than the narrow emission lines typically targeted by LIM. By accounting for the convolution of spectral features with the instrument's spectral response across redshift, our technique enables simultaneous constraints on the redshift-dependent emission from multiple features. This approach enables 3D intensity mapping with some of the brightest features in the infrared spectra of galaxies: the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands. We forecast the detectability of PAH signals using feature intensity mapping with the ongoing SPHEREx mission in the near-infrared and the proposed PRIMA mission in the far-infrared. We find that $S/N$ of $\gtrsim 10$ per redshift bin of widths $\Delta z = 0.1$ and $0.5$ can be achieved at $z &lt; 0.5$ and $1 &lt; z &lt; 5$ with SPHEREx and PRIMA, respectively, for multiple PAH features, suggesting a promising prospect for mapping the aggregate PAH emission at cosmological distances with upcoming datasets.</description>

      <title>Group Therapy for Halos: Advancing Halo Mass Estimation for Galaxy Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ = 0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended for GAMA-like surveys (i &lt; 19.2) at z &lt; 0.1 where minimal model dependence is required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates across diverse catalogues with limits of z &lt; 0.3. These calibrated estimators will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Onset of CN Emission in 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Strong Carbon-Chain Depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects provide a direct window into the environmental conditions around stars other than the Sun. The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS, a new interstellar comet, offers a unique opportunity to investigate the physical and chemical properties of interstellar objects and to compare them with those of comets in our own Solar System. In this Letter we present the results of a 10-night spectroscopic and photometric monitoring campaign with the 2.4 m Hiltner and 1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescopes at the MDM Observatory. The campaign was conducted between August 8 and 17 while 3I/ATLAS was inbound at heliocentric distances of 3.2 - 2.9 au. Our observations captured the onset of optical gas activity. Nightly spectra reveal a weak CN emission feature in the coma of 3I/ATLAS, absent during the first nights but steadily strengthening thereafter. We measure a CN production rate of $Q$(CN)$\sim6\times$10$^{24}$ s$^{-1}$, towards the lower end of activity observed in Solar System comets. Simultaneous photometry also indicates a small but measurable increase in the coma's radial profile and increasing $r$-band $Af\rho$ with values in the order of $\sim300$ cm. We derived a gas-to-dust production ratio of $\log Q (\mathrm{CN})/Af\rho\sim22.4$. Our upper limit on the C$_2$-to-CN ratio ($\log Q(\mathrm{C}_2)/Q(\mathrm{CN})\lesssim-0.8$) indicates that 3I/ATLAS is a strongly carbon-chain depleted comet. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are required to verify the apparent carbon-chain depletion and to explore whether such composition represents a recurring trait of the interstellar comet population.</description>
