      <title>f(R) Gravitation: Equivalence of Frames Upon a Conformal Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the Ricci scalar in the Jordan (JF) and Einstein (EF) frames, in the context of f(R) gravitation. We discuss the physical equivalence of these two representations of the theory, which are mathematically equivalent and whose metrics are connected by a conformal transformation. We find that it is possible for this quantity to be singular in the JF but finite in the EF, if the conformal transformation that connects the frames is singular at the same point as the JF Ricci scalar. The absence of this physical singularity in the EF could be used as an argument against the physical equivalence of the frames. A plot of the EF potential as a function of the associated conformal field shows that the absence of the singularity allows the field to assume values associated to arbitrarily large values of the Ricci curvature. A conjecture is then proposed: the dynamics of the conformal field can be interpreted as a mechanism that can prevent the creation of singularities in the JF.</description>

      <title>Radial Mode Stability of Two-Fluid Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial mode stability is a necessary condition for the astrophysical viability of compact objects. In recent years, astrophysical models with two fluids have gain popularity, especially in their ability to model dark matter admixed neutron stars.Just as is the case of single-fluid stars, a stability criterion based on the background equations has been developed -- the critical curve for the particle numbers of the two fluids in the two-dimensional configuration space determines a one-dimensional sequence that labels the marginally stable configurations -- but its validity depends on the linear stability of radial perturbations which remains unstudied. In this paper, we establish a set of stability criteria for two perfect-fluid relativistic stars by carefully studying the radial mode perturbation equations. We prove that modes are complete, have real eigenvalues with a minimum eigenvalue (i.e. a fundamental mode), thus a configuration is stable if and only if the fundamental mode is positive. As a consequence, our work formally and rigorously proves these necessary conditions for the stability criterion based on the background equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the properties of a special regular black hole. This analysis investigates the Hawking temperature, remnant radius and mass, as well as the effect of parameter $\xi$ on thermodynamic quantities like entropy, heat capacity, and free energy. The emission rate, evaporation process, quasi-normal modes by calculating Rosen-Morse potential, and topological behavior of the black hole are also explored.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity: Schwarzschild spacetimes with a cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a quantization of the Schwarzschild spacetime in the presence of a cosmological constant, based on midisuperspace methods developed in the spherically symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity, using in particular the 'improved dynamics' scheme. We include both the deSitter and anti-deSitter cases. We find that the quantization puts a Planckian upper limit on the possible values of a positive cosmological constant similar to the bounds obtained earlier from studies of homogeneous spacetimes with a cosmological constant. Using semiclassical physical states, we obtain the effective metric and demonstrate the causal structure for various cases. Quantum gravity modifications ensure that the singularity is replaced by a transition surface in all the cases, where the curvature invariants approach mass-independent Planckian bounds. Analysis of the effective stress-energy tensor shows that the null energy condition is violated in the vicinity of the transition surface.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Anisotropy and Bianchi Characterization: Killing vector fields and the implied finding of their metric frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the largest scales the universe appears to be almost perfectly homogeneous and isotropic, adhering to the cosmological principle. On smaller scales inhomogeneities and anisotropies become increasingly prominent, reflecting the origin, emergence and formation of structure in the Universe and its cosmological impact. Also, a range of tensions between various cosmological observations may suggest it to be necessary to explore the consequences of such deviations from the ideal uniform universe. In this study, we restrict this to an investigation of anisotropies on the nature of the Universe. This motivates a more thorough understanding of the manifestation of anisotropy in cosmological applications. When letting go of the assumption of isotropy, spacetime metrics become homogeneous and completely anisotropic. As such, the Lie algebras of Killing vector fields will be 3D, and fit into the so-called 9-part Bianchi classification. This work strives to, given a suitable 3D Lie algebra of vector fields $\{\xi_a\}_{a=1,2,3}$ reconstruct the basis for a metric on which this Lie algebra is Killing. Through finding a determining equation for the frame invariant under $\{\xi_a\}$ and using the method of characteristics to solve it, expressions for said invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$ are obtained. This leads to general equations for the invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$, organized by Bianchi class. Some examples demonstrating this method are worked out.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Bardeen Black Hole in Cloud of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational lensing by Bardeen black hole in cloud of strings (CoS) in strong field limit. The effect of CoS parameter $b$ has been outlined in comparison with Bardeen black hole lens. The impact parameter increases as we increase the CoS parameter consequently more photons approach towards lens. We also obtain magnification of relativistic images and determine relativistic Einstein rings by using the parameters of two astrophysical black hole lenses $SgrA^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. We constrain CoS parameter of black hole using EHT observations for these black holes. We also consider the time delay of signals in the presence of CoS parameter. It is significantly measurable for supermassive black hole $M87^{*}$ than $SgrA^{*}$. This analysis would constrain the Bardeen black hole in CoS as one of the candidates of primordial gravitational lens.</description>

      <title>Sound Speed Resonance of Gravitational Waves in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the occurrence of Sound Speed Resonances (SSR) in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation across a wide range of coupling functions and parameters. After inflation, the damped oscillations of the inflaton around its potential minimum induces damped oscillations of the sound speed of tensor modes, leading to resonant amplification of the latter. Once the inflaton stabilizes around the minimum, the tensor sound speed reduces to unity (speed of light). In the context of multi-field inflation, the sound speed oscillations can be followed by a second phase of inflation, resulting in a distinctive stochastic background of Gravitational Waves (GWs). We show that these GW signals can be probed by upcoming experiments such as $\textbf{SKA}$, $\textbf{DECIGO}$, and $\textbf{BBO}$ depending on the duration of the second inflationary phase.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of classical fields by gravitational shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational shockwaves are geometries where components of the transverse curvature have abrupt behaviour across null hypersurfaces, which are fronts of the waves. We develop a general approach to describe classical field theories on such geometries in a linearized approximation, by using free scalar fields as a model. Perturbations caused by shockwaves exist above the wave front and are solutions to a characteristic Cauchy problem with initial data on the wave front determined by a supertranslation of ingoing fields. A special attention is paid to perturbations of fields of pointlike sources generated by plane-fronted gravitational shockwaves. One has three effects: conversion of non-stationary perturbations into an outgoing radiation, a spherical scalar shockwave which appears when the gravitational wave hits the source, and a plane scalar shockwave accompanying the initial gravitational wave. Our analysis is applicable to gravitational shockwaves of a general class including geometries sourced by null particles and null branes.</description>

      <title>The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dancing with invisible partners: Three-body exchanges with primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance of massive primordial black holes has historically been constrained by dynamical probes. Since these objects can participate in hard few-body scattering processes, they can readily transfer energy to stellar systems, and, in particular, can disrupt wide binaries. However, disruption is not the only possible outcome of such few-body processes. Primordial black holes could also participate in exchange processes, in which one component of a binary system is ejected and replaced by the black hole itself. In this case, the remaining object in the binary would dynamically appear to have an invisible companion. We study the rate of exchange processes for primordial black holes as a component of dark matter and evaluate possible mechanisms for detecting such binaries. We find that many such binaries plausibly exist in the Solar neighborhood, and show that this process can account for observed binary systems whose properties run counter to the predictions of isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>A holographic model of magnetohydrodynamics with fortuitous SO(3) symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study magnetohydrodynamics using holography. The gravity model is closely related to the STU supergravity in five dimensions and admits an analytical black brane solution carrying the conserved charge dual to the magnetic 1-form symmetry of the magnetohydrodynamic system. The black brane solution features a fortuitous SO(3) symmetry, providing a new symmetry principle for describing the magnetohydrodynamics. Since the bulk theory contains multiple 2-form gauge fields, the resistivity becomes matrix-valued. We find that the antisymmetric part of the resistivity matrix exhibits novel features depending on the UV cut-off of the theory. We also compute the shear and bulk viscosities and find that the bulk viscosity is proportional to the shear viscosity. Remarkably, the proportionality constant is exactly what is required for conformality, despite the zeroth-order energy-momentum tensor not being trace-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct several solutions of effective actions for string theories beyond the supergravity approximation utilizing the framework of the Double Field Theory (DFT). The DFT effective actions, which are well suited for accommodating abelian and non-abelian T dualities, are naturally written in terms of modified connections and curvatures with torsion. We construct the most general solutions with vanishing modified torsion, and such geometries don't receive quantum corrections. We also compute the leading $\alpha'$ corrections to several supergravity solutions, including a pair of geometries related by a non-abelian T duality.</description>

Abstract: The Robinson-Trautman solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ system admits a shear-free and twist-free null geodesic congruence with a nonvanishing expansion. Restricting to the case where the Maxwell field is aligned, i.e., the spacetime is algebraically special, we provide an exhaustive classification of supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman spacetimes in the four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity. The differential constraints that arise from the integrability conditions of the Killing spinor equation enable us to systematically reconstruct the metric. We derive the explicit form of the Killing spinor either by directly integrating the Killing spinor equation or by casting the solution into the canonical form of supersymmetric solutions given in hep-th/0307022. In any case, the supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman solution generically exhibits a naked singularity.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Background and Individual Sources from Supermassive Binary Black Holes: Probe of Cosmic Large Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) groups have recently claimed the detection of nanohertz gravitational wave (GW) background, but the origin of this GW signal remains unclear. Nanohertz GWs generated by supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) are one of the most important GW sources in the PTA band. Utilizing data from numerical cosmology simulation, we generate mock SMBBHs within the observable universe and treat them as PTA band GW sources. We present their statistical properties, and analyze the isotropic and anisotropic characteristics of the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal they produce. Specifically, we derive the characteristic amplitude and spectrum of the GWB signal, and calculate the angular power spectrum for both GW strains/energy density and the position distribution of GW sources. We predict that the angular power spectrum of GWB energy density has $C_1/C_0\approx0.40\pm0.32$, and $C_l/C_0\simeq \frac{1}{2(2l+1)}$ (for $l&gt;1$). Furthermore, for the upcoming Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA) PTA, we predict the spatial distribution, numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution of individual GW sources that may be detected with SNR&gt;8, and study the anisotropy property in the spatial distribution of these individual GW sources.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological theory where the kinetic term and potential have $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. Potentials have a plateau at large values of the inflaton field where the axion forms a flat direction, a saddle point at $\tau=i$, and a minimum at $\tau=e^{2\pi i\over 3}$. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry, the theory exhibits an $\alpha$-attractor behavior: its cosmological predictions are stable with respect to certain modifications of the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We present a supersymmetric version of this theory in the framework of $\overline {D3}$ induced geometric inflation. The choice of $\alpha$ is determined by underlying string compactification. For example, in a CY compactification with $T^2$, one has $3\alpha=1$, the lowest discrete Poincar\'e disk target for LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermal correlators and quasinormal modes from semiclassical Virasoro blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by its relevance for thermal correlators in strongly coupled holographic CFTs, we refine and further develop a recent exact analytic approach to black hole perturbation problem, based on the semiclassical Virasoro blocks, or equivalently via AGT relation, the Nekrasov partition functions in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit. Focusing on asymptotically $\text{AdS}_5$ black hole backgrounds, we derive new universal exact expressions for holographic thermal two-point functions, both for scalar operators and conserved currents. Relatedly, we also obtain exact quantization conditions of the associated quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our expressions for the holographic $\text{CFT}_4$ closely resemble the well-known results for 2d thermal CFTs on $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$. This structural similarity stems from the locality of fusion transformation for Virasoro blocks. We provide numerical checks of our quantization conditions for QNMs. Additionally, we discuss the application of our results to understand specific physical properties of QNMs, including their near-extremal and asymptotic limits. The latter is related to a certain large-momentum regime of semiclassical Virasoro blocks dual to Seiberg-Witten prepotentials.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic and Comparative Analysis of Dark Energy Models with $q(z)$ Parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09749v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a diagnostic analysis of three dark energy models resulting from the parametrization of the deceleration parameter. These models exhibit intriguing features, including late-time acceleration and a cosmological phase transition from early deceleration to late acceleration. The analysis utilizes parametrizations of the deceleration parameter, $q(z)$, and employs Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB), Quasar (Q) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) datasets to constrain the models and determine the best-fitting values of the model parameters. Additionally, the evolution of kinematic cosmographic parameters is investigated. The study focuses on discussing the statefinder and Om diagnostic analyses of the considered models, comparing them with the well-established $\Lambda$CDM and SCDM models. By utilizing information criteria, the viability of the models is examined, assessing their goodness of fit and their ability to explain the observed data. The results provide valuable insights into the behavior and characteristics of the dark energy models. The comparison with the standard models sheds light on the similarities and differences, while the information criteria analysis offers a quantitative assessment of their suitability. This analysis contributes to our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the universe, furthering our knowledge of dark energy and its role in shaping the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Probing eccentric higher-order modes through an effective chirp mass model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three observational runs of advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors have detected $\sim$ 90 compact binary coalescence events with most of them being quasicircular compact binary merger events. Astrophysical models predict compact binary mergers with appreciable nonzero eccentricity if in dense stellar environments like globular clusters, active galactic nuclei discs. Gravitational wave searches from eccentric systems are either limited to very low eccentricities or rely on model-agnostic time-frequency-based searches. Typically, gravitational waves from eccentric systems with moderate eccentricities carry non-negligible energy in the eccentric higher-order modes. In this work, using the effective chirp mass model [N. Bose and A. Pai, Phys. Rev. D 104, 124021 (2021)] developed using EccentricTD waveform, we develop a phenomenological scaling relation for the eccentric higher-order mode time-frequency track. Further, we incorporate this additional information from the higher-order eccentric mode for nonspinning, stellar mass eccentric binaries to improve the constraint on eccentricity.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the accelerated cosmic expansion in the late Universe by examining two dark energy models, viscous modified Chaplygin gas (VsMCG) and variable modified Chaplygin gas (VMCG), within loop quantum cosmology alongside the $\Lambda$CDM model. The objective is to constrain cosmic parameters using the $\Lambda$CDM model and 30 of the latest $H(z)$ measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC), including Type Ia Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB), Quasars, and 24 uncorrelated baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements across a redshift range from 0.106 to 2.33. The latest Hubble constant measurement from Riess in 2022 is included to enhance constraints. In the $\Lambda$CDM, VsMCG, and VMCG frameworks, best-fit parameters for the Hubble parameter ($H_0$) and sound horizon ($r_d$) are obtained. The results highlight significant disparities between $H_0$ and $r_d$ values from late-time observational measurements, reflecting the known $H_0$ and $r_d$ tensions. The gravitational lensing optical depth of the two dark energy models is studied by plotting $\log(\tau(z_l)/H_0^{-3} \tau_N)$ vs $z_l$. The probability of finding gravitational lenses (optical depth) in both models increases with lens redshift $z_l$. The change in optical depth behavior for different parameter constraints is graphically analyzed. A joint analysis of VsMCG and VMCG with $\Lambda$CDM is conducted. While the models diverge in the early Universe, they are indistinguishable at low redshift. Using the Akaike information criteria, the analysis indicates that neither dark energy model can be</description>

      <title>Bounds on the photon mass via the Shapiro effect in the solar system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of a finite mass for the photon on its propagation in a weak gravitational field. In particular, we analyse the gravitational time delay, also known as the Shapiro effect. We work in isotropic coordinates in the weak-field limit and find that the mass-dependent corrections enhance the gravitational time delay. Doppler-tracking data from the Cassini mission allow us to set an upper bound on the photon mass, namely $m_\gamma &lt; 4.9 \times 10^{-7} \, {\rm eV/c^2}$ at $95\%$ CL. We also discuss next-generation solar-system tests of general relativity that could improve this upper limit, potentially by a factor of ten. Though not competitive with the currently best limits, our bound is at the ballpark of earlier ones based on the gravitational bending of light by the Sun.</description>

Abstract: Nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime are considered . Those are of the form $\bg_{\m\n}+ l_\m l_\n$ with $l^2=0$. The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms. one is essentially the Fierz-Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr-Schild family is recovered. Novel examples (even including some simple sources) for more general backgrounds are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational orbital Hall effect of vortex light in Lense-Thirring metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex light, characterized by an intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM) aligned with its propagation direction, is described through vortex electromagnetic waves. Similar to the gravitational spin Hall effect (SHE), vortex light is expected to exhibit intrinsic OAM-dependent trajectories and deviations from the null geodesic plane when propagating through a gravitational field, a phenomenon termed the gravitational orbital Hall effect (OHE). In this work, we model the vortex light as vortex Laguerre-Gaussian electromagnetic wave packets and analyze its motion by solving covariant Maxwell equations within the Lense-Thirring metric. Our findings reveal that the trajectory of vortex light with an intrinsic OAM deviates from the null geodesic in two ways. It deviates both perpendicular to, and within, the null geodesic plane. This behavior contrasts with the gravitational SHE, where spin-polarized light primarily deviates perpendicular to the null geodesic plane. Moreover, the relationship between the deviation and intrinsic OAM differs significantly from that between the deviation and spin. These results suggest a unique interaction between intrinsic OAM and gravity, distinct from the spin-gravity coupling, indicating that the gravitational OHE of light might not be precisely predicted by merely substituting spin with intrinsic OAM in the gravitational SHE of light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational interactions were studied by measuring the influence of small external field masses on a microwave resonator. It consisted of two spherical mirrors, which acted as independent pendulumsindividually suspended by strings. Two identical field masses weremoved along the axis of the resonator symmetrically and periodically betweena near and a far position. Their gravitational interaction altered the distance between the mirrors, changing the resonance frequency, which was measured and found consistent with Newton's law of gravity.
  The acceleration of a single mirror caused by the two field masses at the closest position varied from $5.4 \cdot 10^{-12} m/s^2$ to $259 \cdot 10^{-12}\ m/s^2$.</description>

      <title>Finite distance effects on the Hellings-Downs curve in modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing interest in the overlap reduction function in pulsar timing array observations as a probe of modified gravity. However, current approximations to the Hellings-Downs curve for subluminal gravitational wave propagation, say $v&lt;1$, diverge at small angular pulsar separation. In this paper, we find that the ORF for the $v&lt;1$ case is sensitive to finite distance effects. First, we show that finite distance effects introduce an effective cut-off in the spherical harmonics decomposition at $\ell\sim \sqrt{1-v^2} \, kL$, where $\ell$ is the multipole number, $k$ the wavenumber of the gravitational wave and $L$ the distance to the pulsars. Then, we find that the overlap reduction function in the small angle limit approaches a value given by $\pi kL\,v^2\,(1-v^2)^2$ times a normalization factor, exactly matching the value for the autocorrelation recently derived. Although we focus on the $v&lt;1$ case, our formulation is valid for any value of $v$.</description>

Abstract: We address a dynamical, spherically symmetric background in beyond Horndeski theory and formulate a set of linear stability conditions for high energy perturbation modes above an arbitrary solution. In this general setting we derive speeds of propagation in both radial and angular directions for gravity waves and compare them with the speed of light in the case of minimally coupled photon. In particular, we find that the class of beyond Horndeski theories, which satisfy the equality of gravity waves' speed to the speed of light over a cosmological background, feature gravity waves propagating at luminal speeds above a time-dependent inhomogeneous background as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use conformal geometry methods and the construction of Friedrich's cylinder at spatial infinity to study the propagation of spin-$0$ fields (solutions to the wave equation) on $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes in a neighbourhood of spatial and null infinity. We obtain formal solutions written in terms of series expansions close to spatial and null infinity and use them to compute non-trivial asymptotic spin-$0$ charges. It is shown that if one considers the most general initial data within the class considered in this paper, the expansion is poly-homogeneous and hence of restricted regularity at null infinity. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the initial data needed to obtain regular solutions and well-defined limits for the asymptotic charges at the critical sets where null infinity and spatial infinity meet. In four dimensions, we find that there are infinitely many well-defined asymptotic charges at the critical sets, while for higher dimensions there is only a finite number of non-trivial asymptotic charges that remain regular at the critical sets.</description>

      <title>A new quantization scheme of black holes in effective loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology has achieved great successes, in which the polymerization plays a crucial role. In particular, the phase-space-variable dependent polymerization turns out to be the unique one that leads to consistent quantization of the homogeneous and isotropic universe. However, when applying the same scheme to the quantization of black holes, it meets resistances, when the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) gauge is adopted. In this paper, we continue to study the quantum effects of the polymerization near the location that a classical black hole horizon used to be, from the point of view of effective loop quantum gravity in the KS gauge. In particular, we find a phase-space-variable dependent polymerization scheme that leads to negligible quantum effects near the location of the classical black hole horizon, but significantly alters the spacetime structure near the origin, so that the classical singularity is finally replaced by a finite and regular transition surface. The final geodesically-complete spacetime consists of the regular transition surface that connects a black hole in one side and an anti-trapped region in the other side. In the anti-trapped region, no white hole horizons are found and the spacetime is extended to infinity, at which the geometric radius of the two-spheres becomes infinitely large.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas Models in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity: Utilizing Late-time Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06286</link>

Abstract: This study examines accelerated cosmic expansion using the Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas (VMMG) and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas (GCCM) within Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Our aim is to constrain essential cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble Parameter ($H_{0}$) and Sound Horizon ($r_{d}$). We utilize late-time datasets: 17 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations, 33 Cosmic Chronometer measurements, 40 Type Ia Supernovae data points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram data points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts data points, along with the latest determination of the Hubble constant (R22). Treating $r_{d}$ as a free parameter offers several advantages, including mitigating bias, enhancing precision, and improving compatibility with various datasets. By introducing random correlations in the covariance matrix during simulation, errors are effectively reduced. Our estimated values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and $r_{d}$ consistently align with measurements from both the Planck and SDSS experiments. Cosmographic tests provide valuable insights into the dynamics of various cosmological models, enriching our understanding of cosmic evolution. Statefinder diagnostics offer deeper insights into cosmic expansion dynamics, aiding in distinguishing between cosmological frameworks. Furthermore, the $o_{m}$ diagnostic test reveals that at late times, VMMG falls into the phantom region, while GCCM falls into the quintessence region. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) support all models, indicating plausible explanations. Notably, the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges with the lowest AIC score, suggesting its relatively superior fit. Validation via the reduced $\chi_{\text{red}}^{2}$ statistic confirms satisfactory fits across all models, reinforcing their credibility.</description>

      <title>In LIGO's Sight? Vigorous Coherent Gravitational Waves from Cooled Collapsar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first numerical study of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsar disks, using state-of-the-art 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars. These simulations incorporate a fixed Kerr metric for the central black hole (BH) and employ simplified prescriptions for disk cooling. We find that cooled disks with an expected scale height ratio of $H/R\gtrsim0.1$ at $\sim10$ gravitational radii induce Rossby instability in compact, high-density rings. The trapped Rossby vortices generate vigorous coherent emission regardless of disk magnetization and BH spin. For BH mass of $\sim10\,M_\odot$, the GW spectrum peaks at $\sim100\,{\rm Hz}$ with some breadth due to various nonaxisymmetric modes. The spectrum shifts toward lower frequencies as the disk viscously spreads and the circularization radius of the infalling gas increases. Weaker-cooled disks with $H/R\gtrsim0.3$ form a low-density extended structure of spiral arms, resulting in a broader, lower-amplitude spectrum. Assuming an optimistic detection threshold with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 20 and a rate similar to Type Ib/c supernovae, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) could detect $\lesssim1$ event annually, suggesting that GW events may already be hidden in observed data. Third-generation GW detectors could detect dozens to hundreds of collapsar disks annually, depending on the cooling strength and the disk formation rate. The GW amplitudes from collapsar disks are $\gtrsim100$ times higher with a substantially greater event rate than those from core-collapse supernovae, making them potentially the most promising burst-type GW class for LVK and Cosmic Explorer. This highlights the importance of further exploration and modeling of disk-powered GWs, promising insights into collapsing star physics.</description>
