      <title>Rough Path Approaches to Stochastic Control, Filtering, and Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified exposition of rough path methods applied to optimal control, robust filtering, and optimal stopping, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature where no single treatment covers all three areas. By bringing together key elements from Lyons' theory of rough paths, Gubinelli's controlled rough paths, and related developments, we recast these classical problems within a deterministic, pathwise framework. Particular emphasis is placed on providing detailed proofs and explanations where these have been absent or incomplete, culminating in a proof of the central verification theorem, which is another key contribution of this paper. This result establishes the rigorous connection between candidate solutions to optimal control problems and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in the rough path setting. Alongside these contributions, we identify several theoretical challenges -- most notably, extending the verification theorem and associated results to general p-variation with -- and outline promising directions for future research. The paper is intended as a self-contained reference for researchers seeking to apply rough path theory to decision-making problems in stochastic analysis, mathematical finance, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Stability and Contraction Principles for Mean-Field G-SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mean-field stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by G-Brownian motion, extending recent work on existence and uniqueness by developing a full quantitative stability framework. Our main contribution is the construction of an intrinsic stability modulus that provides explicit bounds on the sensitivity of solutions with respect to perturbations in initial data (and, indirectly, coefficients). Using Bihari-Osgood type inequalities under G-expectation, we establish sharp continuity estimates for the data-to-solution map and analyze the asymptotic properties of the stability modulus. In particular, we identify contraction behavior on short horizons, leading to a contraction principle that guarantees uniqueness and global propagation of stability. The results apply under non-Lipschitz, non-deterministic coefficients with square-integrable initial data, thereby significantly broadening the scope of mean-field G-SDEs. Beyond existence and uniqueness, our framework quantifies robustness of solutions under volatility uncertainty, opening new directions for applications in stochastic control, risk management, and mean-field models under ambiguity.</description>

      <title>On Quantum BSDE Solver for High-Dimensional Parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum machine learning framework for approximating solutions to high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that can be reformulated as backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). In contrast to popular quantum-classical network hybrid approaches, this study employs the pure Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) as the core solver without trainable classical neural networks. The quantum BSDE solver performs pathwise approximation via temporal discretization and Monte Carlo simulation, framed as model-based reinforcement learning. We benchmark VQCbased and classical deep neural network (DNN) solvers on two canonical PDEs as representatives: the Black-Scholes and nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The VQC achieves lower variance and improved accuracy in most cases, particularly in highly nonlinear regimes and for out-of-themoney options, demonstrating greater robustness than DNNs. These results, obtained via quantum circuit simulation, highlight the potential of VQCs as scalable and stable solvers for highdimensional stochastic control problems.</description>
