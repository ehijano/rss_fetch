      <title>On the Effect of Coronal Rain on Decayless Kink Oscillations of Coronal Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decayless kink oscillations are ubiquitously observed in active region coronal loops with an almost constant amplitude for several cycles. Decayless kink oscillations of coronal loops triggered by coronal rain have been analysed, but the impact of coronal rain formation in an already oscillating loop is unclear. As kink oscillations can help diagnose the local plasma conditions, it is important to understand how these are affected by coronal rain phenomena. In this study, we present the analysis of an event of coronal rain that occurred on 25 April 2014 and was simultaneously observed by \textit{Slit-Jaw Imager} (SJI) onboard \textit{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph} (IRIS) and \textit{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} (AIA) onboard \textit{Solar Dynamic Observatory} (SDO). The oscillation properties of the coronal loop in AIA are investigated before and after the appearance of coronal rain in SJI. We find signatures of decayless oscillations before and after coronal rain at similar positions to those during coronal rain. The individual cases show a greater amplitude and period during coronal rain. The mean period is increased by 1.3 times during coronal rain, while the average amplitude is increased by 2 times during rain, in agreement with the expected density increase from coronal rain. The existence of the oscillations in the same loop at the time of no coronal rain indicates the presence of a footpoint driver. The properties of the observed oscillations during coronal rain can result from the combined contribution of coronal rain and a footpoint driver. The oscillation amplitude associated with coronal rain is approximated to be 0.14 Mm. The properties of decayless oscillations are considerably affected by coronal rain, and without prior knowledge of coronal rain in the loop, a significant discrepancy can arise from coronal seismology with respect to the true values.</description>

      <title>Structure of proper motions in a sunspot penumbra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure and evolution of the horizontal proper motions in a regular sunspot penumbra, very close to the solar disc center, in active region NOAA 11092 using a 48 min time sequences of blue continuum images recorded by Hinode/SOT in 2010 August 3. We apply local correlation tracking (LCT). The penumbra shows a slow (fast) flow field with an average speed of 0.2 (0.4) km/s starting at its middle towards the umbra (outer penumbral boundary) as an inward (outward) motion in accordance with previous findings. This behavior defines a continuous divergence line at the middle of the penumbra (r~2R_spot/3). A distorted ringlike feature with very slow flows (~50 m/s; zero-flow ring: ZFR) co-spatial with the divergence line is clearly seen. Deep intrusion of coordinated penumbral filaments into the umbra can cause the ZFR to be a) significantly displaced towards the umbra or b) discontinuous, showing considerable speeds there (~150 m/s). Where the ZFR shows discontinuity, the divergence line does not move toward the umbra. Also, because of the different evolutionary flows of adjacent penumbral filaments, the ZFR and the divergence line show a stable backward/forward displacement along itself during the 48 min observation. The radial variations of the azimuthally averaged brightness show a local bright ring with a weak contrast of 1% close to the ZFR. At the outer penumbra, we find that the converging filamentary flow occurs in a dark radial channel and the filamentary diverging flows are formed by the evolution of thin bright fibrils. Also, the large speeds at the penumbra boundary are produced by the displacement and/or the fragmentation of the bright fibrils in developing filamentary flows. In surrounding granulation, some divergence centers are strongly pushed away as a whole with an average speed of about 0.6 km/s by these developing filamentary flows.</description>

      <title>Equator to Pole Solar Chromospheric Differential Rotation using Ca-K Features Derived from Kodaikanal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential rotation is one of the basic characteristics of the Sun, and it plays an important role in generating the magnetic fields and its activities. We investigated rotation rate using chromospheric features such as plages, enhanced network, active network, and quiet network separately (for the first time). The digitized Ca-K images from Kodaikanal Observatory for 1907-1996 are used to study rotation over 0-80 degrees latitudes at an interval of 10$^{\circ}$ . We find that plages and all types of networks exhibit the differential rotation of the chromosphere. Furthermore, the rotation rate shows a decreasing pattern as one move from the equator to the higher polar latitudes for all the features used in the study. By analyzing how the area of chromospheric features varies over time, we can effectively map the Sun's rotation rate at all latitudes, including the polar regions. Interestingly, both plages and small-scale networks exhibit similar differential rotation rate. This suggests these features likely rooted at the same layer below the visible surface of the Sun. Therefore, the long-term Ca-K data is very useful to study the solar rotation rate at all latitudes including the polar regions.</description>

      <title>Searching for evidence of subchromospheric magnetic reconnection on the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the coronae of stars, abundances of those elements with low first ionization potential (FIP) often differ from their photospheric values. The coronae of the Sun and solar-type stars mostly show enhancements of low-FIP elements (the FIP effect) while more active stars such as M dwarfs have coronae generally characterized by the inverse-FIP (I-FIP) effect. Highly localized regions of I-FIP effect solar plasma have been observed by Hinode/EIS in a number of highly complex active regions, usually around strong light bridges of the umbrae of coalescing/merging sunspots. These observations can be interpreted in the context of the ponderomotive force fractionation model which predicts that plasma with I-FIP effect composition is created by the refraction of waves coming from below the plasma fractionation region in the chromosphere. A plausible source of these waves is thought to be reconnection in the (high-plasma \b{eta}) subchromospheric magnetic field. In this study, we use the 3D visualization technique of Chintzoglou &amp; Zhang (2013) combined with observations of localized I-FIP effect in the corona of AR 11504 to identify potential sites of such reconnection and its possible consequences in the solar atmosphere. We found subtle signatures of episodic heating and reconnection outflows in the expected places, in between magnetic flux tubes forming a light bridge, within the photosphere of the active region. Furthermore, on either side of the light bridge, we observed small antiparallel horizontal magnetic field components supporting the possibility of reconnection occuring where we observe I-FIP plasma. When taken together with the I-FIP effect observations, these subtle signatures provide a compelling case for indirect observational evidence of reconnection below the fractionation layer of the chromosphere, however, direct evidence remains elusive.</description>

      <title>The $\gamma$-process nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae II. Effect of the explosive recipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-process in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can produce a number of neutron-deficient stable isotopes heavier than iron (p-nuclei). However, current model predictions do to not fully reproduce the solar abundances. We investigate the impact of different explosion energies and parameters on the nucleosynthesis of p-nuclei, by studying stellar models with different initial masses and CCSN explosions. We find that the total p-nuclei yields are only marginally affected by the CCSN explosion prescriptions if the $\gamma$-process production is already efficient in the stellar progenitors due to a C-O shell merger. In most of CCSN explosions from progenitors without C-O shell merger, the $\gamma$-process yields increase with the explosion energy up to an order of magnitude, depending on the progenitor structure and the CCSN prescriptions. The trend of the p-nuclei production with the explosion energy is more complicated if we look at the production of single p-nuclei. The light p-nuclei tend to be the most enhanced with increasing the explosion energy. In particular, for the CCSN models where the $\alpha$-rich freeze-out component is ejected, the yields of the lightest p-nuclei increase by up to three orders of magnitude. We provide the first extensive study using different sets of massive stars of the impact of varying CCSN explosion prescriptions on the production of the p-nuclei. Unlike previous expectations and recent results in the literature, we find that the average production of p-nuclei tends to increase with the explosion energy. We also confirm that the pre-explosive production of p-nuclei in C-O shell mergers is a robust result, independently from the subsequent explosive nucleosynthesis. A realistic range of variations in the evolution of stellar progenitors and in the CCSN explosions might boost the CCSN contribution to the galactic chemical evolution of p-nuclei.</description>

      <title>A dynamic view of V Hydrae. Monitoring of a spectroscopic-binary AGB star with an alkaline jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well studied carbon star V Hydrae is known to exhibit a complex asymmetric environment made of a dense equatorial wind and high-velocity outflows, hinting at its transition from the AGB phase to the asymmetric planetary nebula phase. In addition, V Hydrae also exhibits a long secondary period of 17 years in its light curve, suggesting the presence of a binary companion that could shape the circumstellar environment. In this paper, we aim to confirm the binary nature of V Hydrae by deriving its orbital parameters and investigating the effect of the orbital motion on the circumbinary environment. In a first step, we used a radial-velocity monitoring performed with the HERMES spectrograph to disentangle the pulsation signal of the AGB from its orbital motion and to obtain the spectroscopic orbit. We combined the spectroscopic results with astrometric information to get the complete set of orbital parameters, including the system inclination. Next, we reported the time variations of the sodium and potassium resonance doublets. Finally, following the methods used for post-AGB stars, we carried out spatio-kinematic modelling of a conical jet to reproduce the observed spectral-line modulation. We found the orbital solution of V Hydrae for a period of 17 years. We correlated the companion passage across the line of sight with the obscuration event and the blue-shifted absorption of alkaline resonant lines. Those variations were modelled by a conical jet emitted from the companion, whose opening angle is wide and whose sky-projected orientation is found to be consistent with the axis of the large-scale bipolar outflow previously detected in the radio-emission lines of CO. We show that the periodic variation seen for V Hydrae is likely to be due to orbital motion. The presence of a conical jet offers a coherent model to explain the various features of V Hydrae environment.</description>

      <title>An impressionist view of V Hydrae. When MATISSE paints Asymmetric Giant Blobs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our purpose is to study the effect of binary companions located within the first 10 stellar radii from the primary AGB star. In this work, we target the mass-losing carbon star V Hydrae (V Hya), looking for signatures of its companion in the dust forming region of the atmosphere. The star was observed in the L- and N-bands with the VLTI/MATISSE instrument at low spectral resolution. We reconstructed images of V Hya's photosphere and surroundings using the two bands and compared our interferometric observables with VLTI/MIDI and VISIR archival data. To constrain the dust properties, we used DUSTY to model the spectral energy distribution. The star is dominated by dust emission in the L- and N- bands. The VISIR image confirms the presence of a large-scale dusty circumstellar envelope surrounding V Hya. The MATISSE reconstructed images show asymmetric and elongated structures in both infrared bands. In the L-band, we detected an elongated shape of approximately 15 mas, likely to be of photospheric origin. In the N-band, we found a 20 mas extension North-East from the star, and perpendicular to the L-band elongated axis. The position angle and the size of the N-band extension match the prediction of the companion position at MATISSE epoch. By comparing MATISSE N-band with MIDI data, we deduce that the elongation axis in the N-band has rotated since the previous interferometric measurements 13 years ago, supporting the idea that the particle enhancement is related to the dusty clump moving along with the companion. The MATISSE images unveil the presence of a dust enhancement at the companion position, opening new doors for further analysis on the binary interaction with an AGB component.</description>

      <title>An extended and refined grid of 3D STAGGER model atmospheres. Processed snapshots for stellar spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Traditional one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres introduce systematic modelling errors into spectroscopic analyses of FGK-type stars. Aims: We present an updated version of the STAGGER-grid of 3D model atmospheres, and explore the accuracy of post-processing methods in preparation for spectral synthesis. Methods: New and old models were (re)computed following an updated workflow, including an updated opacity binning technique. Spectroscopic tests were performed in 3D LTE for a grid of 216 fictitious Fe I lines, spanning a wide range in oscillator strength, excitation potential and central wavelength, and eight model atmospheres that cover the stellar atmospheric parameter range (Teff, log g, [Fe/H]) of FGK-type stars. Using this grid, the impact of vertical and horizontal resolution, and temporal sampling of model atmospheres on spectroscopic diagnostics was tested. Results: We find that downsampling the horizontal mesh from its original size of 240 x 240 grid cells to 80 x 80 cells, i.e. sampling every third grid cell, introduces minimal errors on the equivalent width and normalized line flux across the line and stellar parameter space. Regarding temporal sampling, we find that sampling ten statistically independent snapshots is sufficient to accurately model the shape of spectral line profiles. For equivalent widths, a subsample consisting of only two snapshots is sufficient, introducing an abundance error of less than 0.015 dex. Conclusions: We have computed 32 new model atmospheres and recomputed 116 old model atmospheres present in the original grid. The public release of the STAGGER-grid contains 243 models, excluding models with [Fe/H] = -4.00, and the processed snapshots can be used to improve the accuracy of spectroscopic analyses.</description>

      <title>GRASS II: Simulations of Potential Granulation Noise Mitigation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated version of GRASS (the GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator, Palumbo et al. 2022) which now uses an expanded library of 22 solar lines to empirically model time-resolved spectral variations arising from solar granulation. We show that our synthesis model accurately reproduces disk-integrated solar line profiles and bisectors, and we quantify the intrinsic granulation-driven radial-velocity (RV) variability for each of the 22 lines studied. We show that summary statistics of bisector shape (e.g., bisector inverse slope) are strongly correlated with the measured anomalous, variability-driven RV at high pixel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution. Further, the strength of the correlations vary both line by line and with the summary statistic used. These correlations disappear for individual lines at the typical spectral resolutions and SNRs achieved by current EPRV spectrographs; so we use simulations from GRASS to demonstrate that they can, in principle, be recovered by selectively binning lines that are similarly affected by granulation. In the best-case scenario (high SNR and large number of binned lines), we find that a $\lesssim$30$\%$ reduction in the granulation-induced root mean square (RMS) RV can be achieved, but that the achievable reduction in variability is most strongly limited by the spectral resolution of the observing instrument. Based on our simulations, we predict that existing ultra-high-resolution spectrographs, namely ESPRESSO and PEPSI, should be able to resolve convective variability in other, bright stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new system of equations that fully characterizes adiabatic, radial perturbations of perfect fluid stars within the theory of general relativity. The properties of the system are discussed, and, provided that the equilibrium spacetime verifies some general regularity conditions, analytical solutions for the perturbation variables are found. As illustrative examples, the results are applied to study perturbations of selected classical exact spacetimes, and the first oscillation eigenfrequencies are computed. Exploiting the new formalism, we derive an upper bound for the maximum compactness of stable, perfect fluid stars, which is equation-of-state-agnostic and significantly smaller than the Buchdahl bound.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the long-term existence of dilute cores in giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ring seismology has recently revealed the presence of internal gravity waves inside Saturn that extend up to 60% of Saturn's radius starting from the center, in what is recognized today as Saturn's stably-stratified dilute core. Similarly, gravity measurements on Jupiter suggest the existence of a dilute core of still poorly constrained radial extent. These cores are likely in a double-diffusive regime, which prompt the question of their long-term stability. Indeed, previous DNS (Direct Numerical Simulations) studies in triply-periodic domains have shown that, in some regimes, double-diffusive convection tends to spontaneously form shallow convective layers, which coarsen until the region becomes fully convective. In this letter, we study the conditions for layering in double-diffusive convection using different boundary conditions, in which temperature and composition fluxes are fixed at the domain boundaries. We run a suite of DNS varying microscopic diffusivities of the fluid and the strength of the initial stratification. We find that convective layers still form as a result of the previously discovered gamma-instability which takes place whenever the local stratification drops below a critical threshold that only depends on the fluid diffusivities. We also find that the layers grow once formed, eventually occupying the entire domain. Our work thus recovers the results of previous studies, despite the new boundary conditions, suggesting that this behavior is universal. The existence of Saturn's stably-stratified core, today, therefore suggests that this threshold has never been reached, which places a new constraint on scenarios for the planet's formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Light curves of the explosion of ONe WD+CO WD merger remnant and type Icn supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Icn supernovae (SNe Icn) are a newly detected rare subtype of interacting stripped-envelope supernovae which show narrow P-Cygni lines of highly ionized carbon, oxygen, and neon in their early spectra due to the interactions of the SNe ejecta with dense hydrogen- and helium-deficient circumstellar material (CSM). It has been suggested that SNe Icn may have multiple progenitor channels, such as the explosion of carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars, or the explosion of stripped-envelope SNe which undergo binary interactions. Among the SNe Icn, SN 2019jc shows unique properties, and previous work inferred that it may stem from the ultra-stripped supernova, but other possibilities still exist. In this work, we aim to simulate the light curves from the explosions of oxygen-neon and carbon-oxygen double white dwarf (WD) merger remnants, and to further investigate whether the corresponding explosions can appear as some particular SNe Icn. We generate the light curves from the explosive remnants and analyse the influence of different parameters on the light curves, such as the ejecta mass, explosion energy, mass of Ni56 and CSM properties. Comparing our results with some SNe Icn, we found that the light curves from the explosions of double WD merger remnants can explain the observable properties of SN 2019jc, which inferred that this special SN Icn may have a different progenitor. Our results indicated that double WD merger may be an alternative model in producing at least one of the SNe Icn.</description>

Abstract: "Godzilla" is a peculiar object within the gravitationally lensed Sunburst Arc at $z=2.37$. Despite being very bright, it appears in only one of the twelve lensed images of the source galaxy, and shows exotic spectroscopic properties not found elsewhere in the galaxy. We use JWST's unique combination of spatial resolution and spectroscopic sensitivity to provide a unified, coherent explanation of the physical nature of Godzilla. We measure fluxes and kinematic properties of rest-optical emission lines in Godzilla and surrounding regions. Using standard line ratio-based diagnostic methods in combination with NIRCam imaging and ground based rest-UV spectra, we characterize Godzilla and its surroundings. We find that Godzilla is most likely an extremely magnified, non-erupting LBV star with dense gas condensations in close proximity. Among around 60 detected lines, we find a cascade of strong O I lines pumped by intense Ly$\beta$ emission, as well as Ly$\alpha$-pumped rest-optical Fe II lines, reminiscent of the Weigelt blobs in the local LBV star Eta Carinae. Godzilla is surrounded by dusty, inhomogeneous gas common to massive, evolved stars. Spectra and images of Godzilla and adjacent objects and the detection of a low-surface brightness foreground galaxy in the NIRCam data support the interpretation that Godzilla is a stellar-scale object extremely magnified by alignment with lensing caustics. To explain the dusty surroundings, strong [Ne III] and line kinematics simultaneously, we argue that Godzilla is a post-eruption LBV accompanied by a hotter companion and/or gas condensations exposed to more intense radiation compared to the Weigelt blobs. We expect periodic spectroscopic variations if Godzilla is a binary system. If Godzilla is confirmed to be an LBV star, it expands the distance to the furthest known LBV from a dozen Mpc to several Gpc.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of electrons and ions by an "almost" astrophysical shock in the heliosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shock waves, ubiquitous in the universe, are crucial for particle acceleration in various astrophysical systems. Currently, the heliosphere is the only natural environment available for their in situ study. In this work, we showcase the collective acceleration of electrons and ions by one of the fastest in situ shocks ever recorded, observed by the pioneering Parker Solar Probe at only 34.5 million kilometers from the Sun. Our analysis of this unprecedented, near-parallel shock shows electron acceleration up to 6 MeV amidst intense multi-scale electromagnetic wave emissions. We also present evidence of a variable shock structure capable of injecting and accelerating ions from the solar wind to high energies through a self-consistent process. The exceptional capability of the probe's instruments to measure electromagnetic fields in a shock traveling at 1% the speed of light has enabled us, for the first time, to confirm that the structure of a strong heliospheric shock aligns with theoretical models of strong shocks observed in astrophysical environments. This alignment offers viable avenues for understanding astrophysical shock processes and the acceleration of charged particles.</description>

      <title>Radiation hydrodynamical simulations of super-Eddington mass transfer and black hole growth in close binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation-driven outflows play a crucial role in extracting mass and angular momentum from binary systems undergoing rapid mass transfer at super-Eddington rates. To study the mass transfer process from a massive donor star to a stellar-mass black hole (BH), we perform multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical simulations that follow accretion flows from the first Lagrange point down to about a hundred times the Schwarzschild radius of the accreting BH. Our simulations reveal that rapid mass transfer occurring at over a thousand times the Eddington rate leads to significant mass loss from the accretion disk via radiation-driven outflows. Consequently, the inflow rates at the innermost radius are regulated by two orders of magnitude smaller than the transfer rates. We find that convective motions within the accretion disk drive outward energy and momentum transport, enhancing the radiation pressure in the outskirts of the disk and ultimately generating large-scale outflows with sufficient energy to leave the binary. Furthermore, we observe strong anisotropy in the outflows, which occur preferentially toward both the closest and furthest points from the donor star. However, when averaged over all directions, the specific angular momentum of the outflows is nearly comparable to the value predicted in the isotropic emission case. Based on our simulation results, we propose a formula that quantifies the mass growth rates on BHs and the mass loss rates from binaries due to radiation-driven outflows. This formula provides important implications for the binary evolution and the formation of merging binary BHs.</description>

      <title>The Energy Sources, the Physical Properties, and the Mass-loss History of SN 2017dio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the energy sources, the physical properties of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM), as well as the mass-loss history of the progenitor of SN 2017dio which is a broad-lined Ic (Ic-BL) supernova (SN) having unusual light curves (LCs) and signatures of hydrogen-rich CSM in its early spectrum. We find that the temperature of SN 2017dio began to increase linearly about 20 days after the explosion. We use the $^{56}$Ni plus the ejecta-CSM interaction (CSI) model to fit the LCs of SN 2017dio, finding that the masses of the ejecta, the $^{56}$Ni, and the CSM are $\sim$ 12.41 M$_\odot$, $\sim$ 0.17 M$_\odot$, and $\sim$ 5.82 M$_\odot$, respectively. The early-time photosphere velocity and the kinetic energy of the SN are respectively {$\sim$ 1.89 $\times 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$} and $\sim$ 2.66 $\times 10^{52}$ erg, which are respectively comparable to those of SNe Ic-BL and hypernovae (HNe). We suggest that the CSM of SN 2017dio might be {from an luminous-blue-variable-like outburst or} pulsational pair instability $\sim$ 1.2$-$11.4 yr prior to the SN explosion{, or binary mass transfer}. {Moreover,} we find that its ejecta mass is larger than those of many SNe Ic-BL, and that its $^{56}$Ni mass ($M_{\rm Ni}$) is approximately equal to the mean (or median) value of $M_{\rm Ni}$ of SNe Ic-BL in the literature, but lower than $M_{\rm Ni}$ of prototype HNe (e.g., SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh).</description>

      <title>Influence of Black Hole Kick Velocity on Microlensing Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natal kick velocity distribution for black holes (BHs) is unknown regardless of its importance for understanding the BH formation process. Gravitational microlensing is a unique tool for studying the distribution of BHs in our Galaxy, and the first isolated stellar-mass BH event, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462/MOA-2011-BLG-191 (OB110462), was recently identified by astrometric microlensing. This study investigates how the natal kick velocity for Galactic BHs affects the microlensing event rate distribution. We consider a Maxwell distribution with various average kick velocities, as well as the consequent variation of the spatial distribution of BHs. We find that the event rate for the BH lenses toward the Galactic bulge decreases as $v_{\rm avg}$ increases, mainly due to the scale height inflation. We focus on the unique microlensing parameters measured for OB110462, with microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$ larger than 0.06 for its long timescale of $t_{\rm E} &gt; 200~$ days. We calculate the expected number of BH events occurring with parameters similar to OB110462 during the OGLE-IV survey by Mr\'oz et al. (2017, 2019) and compare it with the actual number that occurred, at least one. Our fiducial model predicts 0.26, 0.19, 0.095, 0.020, and $1.8 \times 10^{-3}$ events occurring for $v_{\rm avg} =$ 25 km/sec, 50 km/sec, 100 km/sec, 200 km/sec, and 400 km/sec, respectively, which suggests that the average kick velocity is likely to be $v_{\rm avg} \lesssim 100~{\rm km/sec}$. The expected number smaller than unity even at maximum might indicate our luckiness of finding OB110462, which can be tested with future surveys by e.g. the Roman space telescope.</description>

      <title>On the Flux-Intensity Relation of Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a study on the relationship between flux and intensity for molecular clouds. Our analysis is established on high-quality CO images from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. The new flux-intensity relation characterizes the flux variation of molecular clouds above specific intensity levels. We found that the flux-intensity relation exhibits two prominent features. First, the flux-intensity relation generally follows exponential shapes; secondly, hierarchical structures of molecular clouds are imprinted on flux-intensity relations. Specifically, 12CO flux-intensity relations are composed of one or more exponential segments, and for molecular clouds with segmented flux-intensity relations, the edge and the flux of the high-temperature component are strikingly consistent with 13CO emission. Further analysis shows that a similar relationship also exists between 13CO flux-intensity relations and C18O emission. The mean brightness temperature of molecular clouds is tightly associated with the decay rate of flux, the break temperature of exponential segments, and, to a certain extent, the flux fraction of the high-temperature component. Broadly, the flux-intensity relation of a molecular tracer, either in optically thick or in optically thin cases, has the capability to outline the silhouette of internal structures of molecular clouds, proving to be a potent tool for probing structures of molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>The Red Supergiant Progenitor of Type II Supernova 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the progenitor and its local environment for the recently discovered type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi at a distance of about 6.7~Mpc, by utilizing the pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and \textit{Spitzer} Space Telescope. The progenitor is identified as a red, bright variable star, with absolute $F814W$-band magnitudes being $-$6.2 mag in 1995 to $-$7.2 mag in 2003, respectively, consistent with that of a normal red supergiant (RSG) star. Combining with the historical mid-infrared light curves, a pulsational period of about 379~days can be inferred for the progenitor star. Fitting its spectral energy distribution with stellar spectral models yields the stellar parameters of temperature, radius and bolometric luminosity as $T_*=3290_{-27}^{+19}$~K, $R_*=887_{-51}^{+60}$~R$_{\odot}$, and log($L$/L$_{\odot}$)$=4.92_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$, respectively. The above parameters indicate that the progenitor of SN 2024ggi is consistent with the stellar evolutionary track of a solar-metallicity massive star with an initial mass of $13_{-1}^{+1}$~M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, our analysis indicates a relatively low mass loss rate (i.e., $&lt; 3\times10^{-6}$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) for the progenitor compared to that inferred from the flashed spectra and X-ray detection (i.e., $10^{-2}$$-$$ 10$$^{-5}$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$), implying a significant enhancement in mass loss within a few years prior to the explosion.</description>

      <title>Formation of N-bearing complex organic molecules in molecular clouds: Ketenimine, acetonitrile, acetaldimine, and vinylamine via the UV photolysis of C$_2$H$_2$ ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solid-state C$_2$H$_2$ chemistry in interstellar H$_2$O-rich ice has been proposed to explain astronomically observed complex organic molecules (COMs), including ketene (CH$_2$CO), acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH), toward early star-forming regions. This formation mechanism is supported by recent laboratory studies and theoretical calculations for the reactions of C$_2$H$_2$+OH/H. However, the analog reaction of C$_2$H$_2$+NH$_2$ forming N-bearing species has been suggested to have a relatively low rate constant that is orders of magnitude lower than the value of C$_2$H$_2$+OH. This work extends our previous laboratory studies on O-bearing COM formation to investigate the interactions between C$_2$H$_2$ and NH$_3$ ice triggered by cosmic ray-induced secondary UV photons under molecular cloud conditions. Experiments were performed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber to investigate the UV photolysis of the C$_2$H$_2$:NH$_3$ ice mixture at 10 K. The studied ice chemistry of C$_2$H$_2$ with NH$_2$ radicals and H atoms resulting from the UV photodissociation of NH$_3$ leads to the formation of several N-bearing COMs, including vinylamine (CH$_2$CHNH$_2$), acetaldimine (CH$_3$CHNH), acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN), ketenimine (CH$_2$CNH), and tentatively ethylamine (CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$). The experimental results show an immediate and abundant CH$_2$CHNH$_2$ yield as the first-generation product, which is further converted into other chemical derivatives. The effective destruction and formation cross-section values of parent species and COMs were derived, and we discuss the chemical links among these molecules and their astronomical relevance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to develop a computationally inexpensive approach, based on machine learning techniques, to accurately predict thousands of stellar rotation periods. The innovation in our approach is the use of the XGBoost algorithm to predict the rotation periods of Kepler targets by means of regression analysis. Therefore, we focused on building a robust supervised machine learning model to predict surface stellar rotation periods from structured data sets built from the Kepler catalogue of K and M stars. We analysed the set of independent variables extracted from Kepler light curves and investigated the relationships between them and the ground truth. Using the extreme gradient boosting method, we obtained a minimal set of variables that can be used to build machine learning models for predicting stellar rotation periods. Our models are validated by predicting the rotation periods of about 2900 stars. The results are compatible with those obtained by classical techniques and comparable to those obtained by other recent machine learning approaches, with the advantage of using much fewer predictors. Restricting the analysis to stars with rotation periods of less than 45 days, our models are on average 96 % correct. We have developed an innovative approach, based on a machine learning method, to accurately fit the rotation periods of stars. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the best models generated by the proposed methodology are competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches, with the advantage of being computationally cheaper, easy to train, and relying on small sets of predictors.</description>

      <title>Seeds and Sequences of Element Abundances in Solar Energetic Particle Events</title>

Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the small "impulsive" events, primarily accelerated during magnetic reconnection in solar jets, have strong enhancements of the abundances of increasingly heavy elements. In contrast, the shock acceleration of ambient coronal plasma in most large "gradual" SEP events produces flat or decreasing abundances vs. element mass-to-charge ratios A/Q. However, heavy-ion enhancements in the largest gradual SEP events can occur in two ways: (1) strong streaming of protons away from the shock amplifies Alfven waves that preferentially scatter and retard protons near the shock while increasingly-heavy ions can leak out, and (2) strong shock waves re-accelerate SEPs fed from persistent impulsive SEP events streaming from some active regions, with their pre-enhanced heavy ions becoming dominant. Power-law fits of abundance enhancements vs. A/Q can distinguish the latter events by the presence of both impulsive and coronal-seed components, and the best-fit charges Q define characteristic source temperatures. Intense impulsively-seeded events can occur in sequences fed from a single persistent active-region as it rotates across the disk of the Sun. Three week-long event sequences, each producing two or three very large events, occur early in the strong solar-cycle 23. The weak solar-cycle 24, produces only one impulsively-seeded event sequence - perhaps a dearth of both impulsive seeds and sufficiently strong shocks. Solar cycle 25 has produced an unusual active period of short strong impulsive events In contrast, there are other active regions where large events alternate SEPs with and without impulsively-seeded sources. We also find that events with moderate Alfven-wave trapping near the shock can release ions slowly or rapidly as a function of A/Q. This A/Q-dependent trapping acts almost as a magnetic spectrometer that separates elements in space and time.</description>

      <title>Mixing is easy: New insights for cosmochemical evolution from pre-stellar core collapse</title>

Abstract: Signposts of early planet formation are ubiquitous in substructured young discs. Dense, hot and high-pressure regions formed during gravitational collapse process, integral to star formation, facilitate dynamical mixing of dust within the protostellar disc. This provides an incentive to constrain the role of gas-dust interaction and resolve zones of dust concentration during star-disc formation. We explore if thermal and dynamical conditions developed during disc formation can generate gas flows that efficiently mix and transport well-coupled gas and dust components. We simulated the collapse of dusty molecular cloud cores with the hydrodynamics code PLUTO augmented with radiation transport and self-gravity. We used a 2D axisymmetric geometry and follow the azimuthal component of velocity. Dust was treated as Lagrangian particles that are subject to drag from the gas, whose motion is computed on a Eulerian grid. We considered 1, 10 and 100 micron-sized neutral spherical dust. Importantly, the equation of state accurately includes molecular hydrogen dissociation. We focus on molecular cloud core masses of 1 and 3 Msun and explore effects of initial rotation rates and cloud core sizes. Our study underlines mechanisms for early transport of dust from inner hot disc regions via the occurrence of meridional flows and outflow. The vortical flow fosters dynamical mixing and retention of dust while thermal pressure driven outflow replenishes dust in the outer disc. Young dynamical precursors to planet-forming discs exhibit regions with complex hydrodynamical gas features and high-temperature structures. These can play a crucial role in concentrating dust for subsequent growth into protoplanets. Dust transport, especially, from sub-au scales surrounding the protostar to outer relatively cooler parts, offers an efficient pathway for thermal reprocessing during pre-stellar core collapse.

      <title>Can near-to-mid infrared spectral energy distribution quantitatively trace protoplanetary disk evolution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) spectral energy distribution (SED) is the major tracer of protoplanetary disks. It was recently proposed to use the near-to-mid IR (or K-24) SED slope $\alpha$ defined between 2-24$\mu$m as a potential quantitative tracer of disk age. We critically examine the viability of this idea and confront it with additional statistics of IR luminosities and SED shapes. We point out that, because the statistical properties of most of the complicated physical factors involved in disk evolution are still poorly understood in a quantitative sense, the only viable way is to assume them to be random so that an idealized `average disk' can be defined, which allows the $\alpha$ histogram to trace its age. We confirm that the statistics of the zeroth order (luminosity), first order (slope $\alpha$) and second order characteristics (concavity) of the observed K-24 SEDs indeed carry useful information upon the evolutionary processes of the `average disk'. We also stress that intrinsic diversities in K-24 SED shapes and luminosities are always large at the level of individual stars so that the application of the evolutionary path of the `average disk' to individual stars must be done with care. The data of most curves in plots are provided on GitHub.</description>

New determinations of the nuclear reaction rates for key fusion reactions of stellar evolution are now available, paving the way to improved stellar model predictions. We explore the impact of new C12+C12 reaction rates for massive stars evolution, structure, and nucleosynthesis during core carbon-burning phase. We analyse the consequences for stars of different masses including rotation-induced mixing. We computed a grid of massive stars at solar metallicity using the stellar evolution code GENEC. We explored the results using three different references for the rates, with or without rotation. We study the effect in terms of evolution, structure, and critical mass limit between intermediate and massive stars. We explored the consequences for nucleosynthesis during the core C-burning phase by means of a one-zone nucleosynthesis code. We confirm the significant impact of using the recent nuclear reaction rates following the hindrance hypothesis as well as the mass-dependent effect of a resonance at 2.14 MeV. This impacts the characteristics of the core of stars from the C-ignition and during all the core C-burning phase. The change of rates modifies the central nucleosynthesis during the core C-burning phase, resulting in an underproduction of s-process elements. The correct and accurate determination of the nuclear reaction rates, with especially the existence and location of resonances, impacts stellar evolution in many aspects affecting the model predictions. The choice of the nuclear reaction rates reference for the C12+C12 fusion reaction changes significantly the behaviour of the core during the C-burning phase. This choice is then to be taken carefully in order to interpret stellar evolution and fate of massive stars.</description>

Abstract: We examine the hypothesis that multipolar magnetic fields advected by photospheric granules can contribute heating to the active chromosphere and corona. On 28 September 2020 the GRIS and HiFI+ instruments at the GREGOR telescope obtained data of NOAA 12773. We analyze Stokes profiles of spectral lines of Si I and He I, to study magnetic fields from photosphere to the upper chromosphere. Magnetogram and EUV data from the HMI and AIA instruments on the SDO spacecraft are co-aligned and studied in relation to the GRIS data. At coronal loop footpoints, minor polarity fields comprise just 0.2% and 0.02% of the flux measured over the 40" x 60" area observed in the photosphere and upper chromosphere, centered 320" from disk center. Significantly, the minority fields are situated &gt;~ 12" from bright footpoints. We use physical arguments to show that any unresolved minority flux cannot reach coronal footpoints adjacent to the upper chromosphere. Even if it did, the most optimistic estimate of the energy released through chromospheric reconnection is barely sufficient to account for the coronal energy losses. Further, dynamical changes accompanying reconnection between uni- and multi- polar fields are seen neither in the He I data nor in narrow-band movies of the H alpha line core. We conclude that the hypothesis must be rejected. Bright chromospheric, transition region and coronal loop plasmas must be heated by mechanisms involving unipolar fields.</description>

      <title>Validation of a Third Planet in the LHS 1678 System</title>

Abstract: The nearby LHS 1678 (TOI-696) system contains two confirmed planets and a wide-orbit, likely-brown-dwarf companion, which orbit an M2 dwarf with a unique evolutionary history. The host star occupies a narrow "gap" in the HR diagram lower main sequence, associated with the M dwarf fully convective boundary and long-term luminosity fluctuations. This system is one of only about a dozen M dwarf multi-planet systems to date that hosts an ultra-short period planet (USP). Here we validate and characterize a third planet in the LHS 1678 system using TESS Cycle 1 and 3 data and a new ensemble of ground-based light curves. LHS 1678 d is a 0.98 +/-0.07 Earth radii planet in a 4.97-day orbit, with an insolation flux of 9.1 +0.9/-0.8 Earth insolations. These properties place it near 4:3 mean motion resonance with LHS 1678 c and in company with LHS 1678 c in the Venus zone. LHS 1678 c and d are also twins in size and predicted mass, making them a powerful duo for comparative exoplanet studies. LHS 1678 d joins its siblings as another compelling candidate for atmospheric measurements with the JWST and mass measurements using high-precision radial velocity techniques. Additionally, USP LHS 1678 b breaks the "peas-in-a-pod" trend in this system, although additional planets could fill in the "pod" beyond its orbit. LHS 1678's unique combination of system properties and their relative rarity among the ubiquity of compact multi-planet systems around M dwarfs makes the system a valuable benchmark for testing theories of planet formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis in the Innermost Ejecta of Magnetorotational Supernova Explosions in 3-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions powered by rotation and magnetic fields present an interesting astrophysical site for nucleosynthesis that potentially contributes to the production of $r$-process elements. Here we present yields of the innermost ejecta in 3D magnetorotational CCSN models simulated using the CoCoNuT-FMT code. Strong magnetic fields tap the rotational energy of the proto-neutron star and lead to earlier and more energetic ($\sim 3\times 10^{51}$ erg) explosions than typical neutrino-driven CCSNe. Compared to a reference non-magnetic model, the ejecta in the magnetorotational models have much more neutron-rich components with Ye down to $\sim$0.25. Our post-processing calculations with the reaction network SkyNet show significant production of weak $r$-process elements up to mass number $\sim$130. We find negligible differences in the synthesis of heavy elements between two magnetorotational models with different initial field strength of 10$^{10}$ and 10$^{12}$ G, in accord with their similar explosion dynamics. The magnetorotational models produce about $\sim$0.19 and 0.14 Msun of radioactive $^{56}$Ni, on the low end of inferred hypernova nickel masses. The yields are publicly available at Zenodo: doi:10.5281/zenodo.10578981 for comparison with stellar abundance patterns, inclusion in modelling galactic chemical evolution, and comparison with other yield calculations. Our results add to the yet restricted corpus of nucleosynthesis yields from 3D magnetorotational supernova simulations and will help quantify yield uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Numerical validation of scaling laws for stratified turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical progress using multiscale asymptotic analysis has revealed various possible regimes of stratified turbulence. Notably, buoyancy transport can either be dominated by advection or diffusion, depending on the effective P\'eclet number of the flow. Two types of asymptotic models have been proposed, which yield measurably different predictions for the characteristic vertical velocity and length scale of the turbulent eddies in both diffusive and non-diffusive regimes. The first, termed a `single-scale model', is designed to describe flow structures having large horizontal and small vertical scales, while the second, termed a `multiscale model', additionally incorporates flow features with small horizontal scales, and reduces to the single-scale model in their absence. By comparing predicted vertical velocity scaling laws with direct numerical simulation data, we show that the multiscale model correctly captures the properties of strongly stratified turbulence within regions dominated by small-scale isotropic motions, whose volume fraction decreases as the stratification increases. Meanwhile its single-scale reduction accurately describes the more orderly, layer-like, quiescent flow outside those regions.</description>

      <title>TESS Free-floating Planet Candidate Is Likely a Stellar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a terrestrial-mass free-floating planet candidate in the light curve of the star TIC 107150013 observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has recently been announced. A short-duration (~0.5 day), low-amplitude (~0.06 mag) brightening in the TESS light curve was interpreted as a short-timescale gravitational microlensing event. However, the purported event occurred far from the Galactic center and the Galactic plane (l~ 239 deg, b ~ -5 deg), on a relatively nearby (~3.2 kpc) star, making the microlensing interpretation unlikely. Here, we report the archival photometric observations of TIC 107150013 collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2018 through 2020. The archival OGLE light curve reveals periodic variability indicative of starspots on the surface of the star. The presence of starspots indicates magnetic activity of the star, which may also manifest as stellar flares. We interpret the brightening of TIC 107150013 seen in the TESS data as the stellar flare. We present similar flaring stars detected in the archival OGLE data, mimicking short-timescale, low-amplitude microlensing events. Such stars may be a source of non-negligible false positive detections in the planned space-based microlensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, not included in the Solar system ephemeris, introduces correlated timing noise for pulsars with the magnitude and frequencies of the reported signal.</description>

      <title>Exploration of morphological coherence in open clusters with a "core-shell'' structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of their morphological coherence allows us to obtain a better understanding of the morphological evolution of open clusters. We employed the ellipsoid fitting method to delineate the 3D spatial structure of the sample clusters while using the morphological dislocation (MD) defined in our previous work and the ellipticity ratio (ER) of the clusters' inner and outer structures to characterize the morphological coherence of the sample clusters. The results show an inverse correlation between the ER of the sample clusters and the number of their members, indicating that sample clusters with a much more elliptical external morphology than internal shape generally tend to host a large number of members. Meanwhile, a slight shrinking of the MD of the sample clusters with their members' number may shed light on the significant role of the gravitational binding of the sample clusters in maintaining their morphological stability. Moreover, there are no correlations between the MD and ER of the sample clusters and their age. They are also not significantly correlated with the X-axis, the Y-axis, their orbital eccentricities, and the radial and vertical forces on them. However, the ER of the sample clusters displays some fluctuations in the distributions between it and the above covariates, implying that the morphologies of the sample clusters are sensitive to the external environment if sample effects are not taken into account. Finally, the analysis of the 3D spatial shapes of sample clusters with a small ER or a large ER demonstrates that the number of members lays an important foundation for forming a dense internal system for sample clusters. At the same time, the MD of the sample clusters can serve well as an indicator of their morphological stability, which is built upon a certain amount of member stars.</description>
