      <title>Sharp $L^q$-Convergence Rate in $p$-Wasserstein Distance for Empirical Measures of Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of (non-symmetric) diffusion processes on a length space, which in particular include the (reflecting) diffusion processes on a connected compact Riemannian manifold, the exact convergence rate is derived for $({\mathbb E} [{\mathbb W}_p^q(\mu_T,\mu)])^{\frac{1}{q}} (T \to \infty)$ uniformly in $(p,q)\in [1,\infty) \times (0,\infty)$, where $\mu_T$ is the empirical measure of the diffusion process, $\mu$ is the unique invariant probability measure, and ${\mathbb W}_p$ is the $p$-Wasserstein distance. Moreover, when the dimension parameter is less than $4$, we prove that ${\mathbb E} |T {\mathbb W}_2^2(\mu_T,\mu)-\Xi(T)|^q \to 0$ as $T\to\infty$ for any $q\ge 1$, where $\Xi(T)$ is explicitly given by eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the symmetric part of the generator.</description>

      <title>Fractional Gaussian noise: Projections, prediction, norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the one-sided and two-sided (bilateral) projections of an element of fractional Gaussian noise onto its neighboring elements. We establish several analytical results and conduct a numerical study to analyze the behavior of the coefficients of these projections as functions of the Hurst index and the number of neighboring elements used for the projection. We derive recurrence relations for the coefficients of the two-sided projection. Additionally, we explore the norms of both types of projections. Certain special cases are investigated in greater detail, both theoretically and numerically.</description>

Abstract: The main result of this paper demonstrates that every Feller's Brownian motion, specifically, the Brownian motion with general boundary conditions as examined by Ito and McKean, can be transformed into a birth-death process through a time-change. Additionally, we have derived the parameters of the birth-death processes in terms of those associated with Feller's Brownian motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we first obtain, for the Kolmogorov distance, an error bound between a tempered stable and a compound Poisson distribution and also an error bound between a tempered stable and an alpha stable distribution via Stein method. For the smooth Wasserstein distance, an error bound between two tempered stable distributions is also derived. As examples, we discuss the approximation of a tempered stable to normal and variance gamma distributions. As corollaries, the corresponding limit theorem follows</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first establish general bounds on the Fisher information distance to the class of normal distributions of Malliavin differentiable random variables. We then study the rate of Fisher information convergence in the central limit theorem for the solution of small noise stochastic differential equations and its additive functionals. We also show that the convergence rate is of optimal order.</description>

      <title>Existence and phase structure of random inverse limit measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogous to Kolmogorov's theorem for the existence of random functions, we consider the existence of limits of inverse systems of random histograms (restrictions of measures to finite partitions of the underlying space). Given a coherent inverse system of random (bounded/ signed/positive/probability) histograms on refining partitions, we study conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a corresponding random inverse limit measure, described by a Radon probability measure on the space of (bounded/signed/positive/probability) measures. Depending on the topology (vague, tight, weak or total-variational) and Kingman's notion of complete randomness, the limiting random (probability) measure is in one of four phases, distinguished by their degrees of concentration (support, domination, discreteness). Results are applied in the well-known Dirichlet and Polya tree families of random probability measures and in a new Gaussian family of signed inverse limit measures. In these three families, examples of all four phases occur and we describe the corresponding conditions on defining parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we resolve a question of D'Achille, Curien, Enriquez, Lyons, and \"Unel by showing that the cells of the ideal Poisson Voronoi tessellation are indistinguishable. This follows from an application of the Howe-Moore theorem and a theorem of Meyerovitch about the nonexistence of thinnings of the Poisson point process. We also give an alternative proof of Meyerovitch's theorem.</description>

      <title>Analysis of The Limiting Spectral Distribution of Large Random Matrices of The Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the random matrix \(\bW_n = \bB_n + n^{-1}\bX_n^*\bA_n\bX_n\), where \(\bA_n\) and \(\bB_n\) are Hermitian matrices of dimensions \(p \times p\) and \(n \times n\), respectively, and \(\bX_n\) is a \(p \times n\) random matrix with independent and identically distributed entries of mean 0 and variance 1. Assume that \(p\) and \(n\) grow to infinity proportionally, and that the spectral measures of \(\bA_n\) and \(\bB_n\) converge as \(p, n \to \infty\) towards two probability measures \(\calA\) and \(\calB\). Building on the groundbreaking work of \cite{marchenko1967distribution}, which demonstrated that the empirical spectral distribution of \(\bW_n\) converges towards a probability measure \(F\) characterized by its Stieltjes transform, this paper investigates the properties of \(F\) when \(\calB\) is a general measure. We show that \(F\) has an analytic density at the region near where the Stieltjes transform of $\calB$ is bounded. The density closely resembles \(C\sqrt{|x - x_0|}\) near certain edge points \(x_0\) of its support for a wide class of \(\calA\) and \(\calB\). We provide a complete characterization of the support of \(F\). Moreover, we show that \(F\) can exhibit discontinuities at points where \(\calB\) is discontinuous.</description>

      <title>The stochastic six-vertex model speed process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the stochastic six-vertex model on the quadrant $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}\times\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}$ with step initial conditions and a single second-class particle at the origin, we show almost sure convergence of the speed of the second-class particle to a random limit. This allows us to define the stochastic six-vertex speed process, whose law we show to be ergodic and stationary for the dynamics of the multi-class stochastic six-vertex process. The proof follows the scheme developed in [ACG23] for ASEP and requires the development of precise bounds on the fluctuations of the height function of the stochastic six-vertex model around its limit shape using methods from integrable probability. As part of the proof, we also obtain a novel geometric stochastic domination result that states that a second-class particle to the right of any number of third-class particles will at any fixed time be overtaken by at most a geometric number of third-class particles.</description>

      <title>Set Values of Dynamic Nonzero Sum Games and Set Valued Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the (unique) value of a stochastic control problem or a two person zero sum game under Isaacs condition can be characterized through a PDE driven by the Hamiltonian. Our goal of this paper is to extend this classical result to nonzero sum games, which typically have multiple Nash equilibria and multiple values. Our object is the set value of the game, which roughly speaking is the set of values over all equilibria and thus is by nature unique. We shall introduce set valued Hamiltonians and characterize the set value of the game through backward SDEs driven by appropriate selectors of the set valued Hamiltonians, where the selectors are typically path dependent. When the set valued Hamiltonian is a singleton, our result covers the standard control problem and two person zero sum game problem under Isaacs condition.</description>

      <title>Parametric Sensitivity Analysis for Models of Reaction Networks within Interacting Compartments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of reaction networks within interacting compartments (RNIC) are a generalization of stochastic reaction networks. It is most natural to think of the interacting compartments as ``cells'' that can appear, degrade, split, and even merge, with each cell containing an evolving copy of the underlying stochastic reaction network. Such models have a number of parameters, including those associated with the internal chemical model and those associated with the compartment interactions, and it is natural to want efficient computational methods for the numerical estimation of sensitivities of model statistics with respect to these parameters. Motivated by the extensive work on computational methods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic reaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in the RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov transformation method (also called the Likelihood Ratio method) and a number of coupling methods for the implementation of finite differences. We provide several numerical examples and conclude that the method associated with the ``Split Coupling'' provides the most efficient algorithm. This finding is in line with the conclusions from the work related to sensitivity analysis of standard stochastic reaction networks. We have made all of the Matlab code used to implement the various methods freely available for download.</description>

      <title>Approximate independence of permutation mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove bounds on statistical distances between high-dimensional exchangeable mixture distributions (which we call permutation mixtures) and their i.i.d. counterparts. Our results are based on a novel method for controlling $\chi^2$ divergences between exchangeable mixtures, which is tighter than the existing methods of moments or cumulants. At a technical level, a key innovation in our proofs is a new Maclaurin-type inequality for elementary symmetric polynomials of variables that sum to zero and an upper bound on permanents of doubly-stochastic positive semidefinite matrices. Our results imply a de Finetti-style theorem (in the language of Diaconis and Freedman, 1987) and general asymptotic results for compound decision problems, generalizing and strengthening a result of Hannan and Robbins (1955).</description>

      <title>Parallel Sampling via Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to use parallelization to speed up sampling from an arbitrary distribution $\mu$ on a product space $[q]^n$, given oracle access to counting queries: $\mathbb{P}_{X\sim \mu}[X_S=\sigma_S]$ for any $S\subseteq [n]$ and $\sigma_S \in [q]^S$. Our algorithm takes $O({n^{2/3}\cdot \operatorname{polylog}(n,q)})$ parallel time, to the best of our knowledge, the first sublinear in $n$ runtime for arbitrary distributions. Our results have implications for sampling in autoregressive models. Our algorithm directly works with an equivalent oracle that answers conditional marginal queries $\mathbb{P}_{X\sim \mu}[X_i=\sigma_i\;\vert\; X_S=\sigma_S]$, whose role is played by a trained neural network in autoregressive models. This suggests a roughly $n^{1/3}$-factor speedup is possible for sampling in any-order autoregressive models. We complement our positive result by showing a lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3})$ for the runtime of any parallel sampling algorithm making at most $\operatorname{poly}(n)$ queries to the counting oracle, even for $q=2$.</description>

      <title>Shift-Dispersion Decompositions of Wasserstein and Cram\'er Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divergence functions are measures of distance or dissimilarity between probability distributions that serve various purposes in statistics and applications. We propose decompositions of Wasserstein and Cram\'er distances$-$which compare two distributions by integrating over their differences in distribution or quantile functions$-$into directed shift and dispersion components. These components are obtained by dividing the differences between the quantile functions into contributions arising from shift and dispersion, respectively. Our decompositions add information on how the distributions differ in a condensed form and consequently enhance the interpretability of the underlying divergences. We show that our decompositions satisfy a number of natural properties and are unique in doing so in location-scale families. The decompositions allow to derive sensitivities of the divergence measures to changes in location and dispersion, and they give rise to weak stochastic order relations that are linked to the usual stochastic and the dispersive order. Our theoretical developments are illustrated in two applications, where we focus on forecast evaluation of temperature extremes and on the design of probabilistic surveys in economics.</description>

      <title>Predicting path-dependent processes by deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a deep learning method for predicting path-dependent processes based on discretely observed historical information. This method is implemented by considering the prediction as a nonparametric regression and obtaining the regression function through simulated samples and deep neural networks. When applying this method to fractional Brownian motion and the solutions of some stochastic differential equations driven by it, we theoretically proved that the $L_2$ errors converge to 0, and we further discussed the scope of the method. With the frequency of discrete observations tending to infinity, the predictions based on discrete observations converge to the predictions based on continuous observations, which implies that we can make approximations by the method. We apply the method to the fractional Brownian motion and the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as examples. Comparing the results with the theoretical optimal predictions and taking the mean square error as a measure, the numerical simulations demonstrate that the method can generate accurate results. We also analyze the impact of factors such as prediction period, Hurst index, etc. on the accuracy.</description>

      <title>Non-ergodic inference for stationary-increment harmonizable stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the class of stationary-increment harmonizable stable processes with infinite control measure, which most notably includes real harmonizable fractional stable motions. We give conditions for the integrability of the paths of such processes with respect to a finite, absolutely continuous measure and derive the distributional characteristics of the path integral with respect to said measure. The convolution of the path of a stationary-increment harmonizable stable process with a suitable measure yields a real stationary harmonizable stable process with finite control measure. This allows us to construct consistent estimators for the index of stability as well as the kernel function in the integral representation of a stationary increment harmonizable stable process (up to a constant factor). For real harmonizable fractional stable motions consistent estimators for the index of stability and its Hurst parameter are given. These are computed directly from the periodogram frequency estimates of the smoothed process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14901v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algorithm is presented that, taking a sequence of independent Bernoulli random variables with parameter $1/2$ as inputs and using only rational arithmetic, simulates a Bernoulli random variable with possibly irrational parameter $\tau$. It requires a series representation of $\tau$ with positive, rational terms, and a rational bound on its truncation error that converges to $0$. The number of required inputs has an exponentially bounded tail, and its mean is at most $3$. The number of arithmetic operations has a tail that can be bounded in terms of the sequence of truncation error bounds. The algorithm is applied to two specific values of $\tau$, including Euler's constant, for which obtaining a simple simulation algorithm was an open problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper we propose and study the approximation of the $SLE_\kappa$ trace via the Ninomiya-Victoir splitting algorithm. We prove the uniform convergence in probability with respect to the sup-norm to the distance between the $SLE_\kappa$ trace and the output of the Ninomiya-Victoir splitting algorithm when applied in the context of the Loewner differential equation. Further investigations on the $L^p$-norm convergence is also exhibited, shedding light on the more delicate convergence structure. In the second part we show the uniform convergence of the approximation of the $SLE_\kappa$ trace obtained using a different scheme that is based on the linear interpolation of the Brownian driving force.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the polynuclear growth model is a completely integrable Markov process in the sense that its transition probabilities are given by Fredholm determinants of kernels produced by a scattering transform based on the invariant measures modulo the absolute height, continuous time simple random walks. From the linear evolution of the kernels, it is shown that the $n$-point distributions are determinants of $n\times n$ matrices evolving according to the two dimensional non-Abelian Toda lattice.</description>

Abstract: We compute the precise logarithmic corrections to Alexander-Orbach behaviour for various quantities describing the geometric and spectral properties of the four-dimensional uniform spanning tree. In particular, we prove that the volume of an intrinsic $n$-ball in the tree is $n^2 (\log n)^{-1/3+o(1)}$, that the typical intrinsic displacement of an $n$-step random walk is $n^{1/3} (\log n)^{1/9-o(1)}$, and that the $n$-step return probability of the walk decays as $n^{-2/3}(\log n)^{1/9-o(1)}$.</description>

      <title>Ray-Knight compactification of birth and death processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A birth and death process is a continuous-time Markov chain with the minimal state space $\mathbb N$, whose transition matrix is standard and whose density matrix is the given birth-death matrix. Birth and death process is unique if and only if $\infty$ is an entrance or natural. When $\infty$ is neither an entrance nor natural, there are two ways in the literature to obtain all birth and death processes. The first one is an analytic treatment proposed by Feller in 1959, and the second one is a probabilistic construction completed by Wang in 1958.
  In this paper we will give another way to study birth and death processes using the Ray-Knight compactification. This way has the advantage of both the analytic and probabilistic treatments above. By applying the Ray-Knight compactification, every birth and death process can be modified into a c\`adl\`ag Ray process on $\mathbb N\cup \{\infty\}\cup\{\partial\}$, which is either a Doob processes or a Feller $Q$-process. Every birth and death process in the second class has a modification that is a Feller process on $\mathbb N\cup\{\infty\}\cup \{\partial\}$. We will derive the expression of its infinitesimal generator, which explains its boundary behaviours at $\infty$. Furthermore, by utilizing transformations of killing and Ikeda-Nagasawa-Watanabe's piecing out, we will also provide a probabilistic construction for birth and death processes. This construction relies on a triple determining the resolvent matrix introduced by Wang and Yang in their work (1992')}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study Markov chains with the state space given by the coordinate axes of $\mathbb R^m$, $m \geq 2$, whose step sizes on each positive half-axis are distributed according to a centered probability distribution with variance $v_i^2 \in (0, \infty)$, $i = 1,\ldots, m$. Under very mild assumptions on the jumps sizes on the negative half-axes, we show that the Donsker scaling limit of such Markov chains is a Walsh Brownian motion whose weights are determined explicitly in terms of stationary distributions of certain embedded Markov chains. This convergence result is applied to integer-valued random walks perturbed on a finite subset of $\mathbb Z$ called a membrane. We show that their Donsker scaling limit is an oscillating skew Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Set-valued stochastic integrals for convoluted L\'{e}vy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study set-valued Volterra-type stochastic integrals driven by L\'{e}vy processes. Upon extending the classical definitions of set-valued stochastic integral functionals to convoluted integrals with square-integrable kernels, set-valued convoluted stochastic integrals are defined by taking the closed decomposable hull of the integral functionals for generic time. We show that, aside from well-established results for set-valued It\^{o} integrals, while set-valued stochastic integrals with respect to a finite-variation Poisson random measure are guaranteed to be integrably bounded for bounded integrands, this is not true when the random measure is of infinite variation. For indefinite integrals, we prove that it is a mutual effect of kernel singularity and jumps that the set-valued convoluted integrals are possibly explosive and take extended vector values. These results have some important implications on how set-valued fractional dynamical systems are to be constructed in general. Two classes of set-monotone processes are studied for practical interests in economic and financial modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine hydrodynamic and modulated energy techniques to study the large deviations of systems of particles with pairwise singular repulsive interactions and additive noise. Specifically, we examine periodic Riesz interactions indexed by parameter $\mathbf{s}\in[0,d-2)$ for $d\geq 3$ on the torus. When $\mathbf{s}\in(0,d-2)$, we establish a large deviation principle (LDP) upper bound and partial lower bound given sufficiently strong convergence of the initial conditions. When $\mathbf{s}=0$ (i.e., the interaction potential is logarithmic), we prove that a complete LDP holds. Additionally, we show a local LDP holds in the distance defined by the modulated energy.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a general result on the long time $\W_0$-$\widetilde{\W}_1$ type propagation of chaos, propagation of chaos with regularization effect, for mean field interacting particle system driven by L\'{e}vy noise is derived, where $\W_0$ is one half of the total variation distance while $\widetilde{\W}_1$ is the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance. By using the method of coupling, the general result is applied to mean field interacting particle system driven by multiplicative Brownian motion and additive $\alpha(\alpha&gt;1)$-stable noise respectively, where the non-interacting drift is assumed to be dissipative in long distance and the initial distribution of interacting particle system converges to that of the limit equation in $\widetilde{\W}_1$.</description>

      <title>Graph Expansions of Deep Neural Networks and their Universal Scaling Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to obtain scaling limits of neural networks using the genus expansion technique from random matrix theory. This approach begins with a novel expansion of neural networks which is reminiscent of Butcher series for ODEs, and is obtained through a generalisation of Fa\`a di Bruno's formula to an arbitrary number of compositions. In this expansion, the role of monomials is played by random multilinear maps indexed by directed graphs whose edges correspond to random matrices, which we call operator graphs. This expansion linearises the effect of the activation functions, allowing for the direct application of Wick's principle to compute the expectation of each of its terms. We then determine the leading contribution to each term by embedding the corresponding graphs onto surfaces, and computing their Euler characteristic. Furthermore, by developing a correspondence between analytic and graphical operations, we obtain similar graph expansions for the neural tangent kernel as well as the input-output Jacobian of the original neural network, and derive their infinite-width limits with relative ease. Notably, we find explicit formulae for the moments of the limiting singular value distribution of the Jacobian. We then show that all of these results hold for networks with more general weights, such as general matrices with i.i.d. entries satisfying moment assumptions, complex matrices and sparse matrices.</description>

Abstract: We prove non asymptotic total variation estimates for the kinetic Langevin algorithm in high dimension when the target measure satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality and has gradient Lipschitz potential. The main point is that the estimate improves significantly upon the corresponding bound for the non kinetic version of the algorithm, due to Dalalyan. In particular the dimension dependence drops from $O(n)$ to $O(\sqrt n)$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on an interval with open boundaries. We provide a representation for its stationary distribution as a marginal of the top layer of a two-layer ensemble under Liggett's condition. The representation is valid in the fan region and in the shock region, extending the representation previously obtained in [Bryc-Zatitskii-2024 arXiv:2403.03275] to ASEP. We also give a recursion for the two-layer weight function.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a large causal polytree from a relatively small i.i.d. sample. This is motivated by the problem of determining causal structure when the number of variables is very large compared to the sample size, such as in gene regulatory networks. We give an algorithm that recovers the tree with high accuracy in such settings. The algorithm works under essentially no distributional or modeling assumptions other than some mild non-degeneracy conditions.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of adaptive approximations for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study numerical approximations for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that use adaptive step sizes. In particular, we consider a general setting where decisions to reduce step sizes are allowed to depend on the future trajectory of the underlying Brownian motion. Since these adaptive step sizes may not be previsible, the standard mean squared error analysis cannot be directly applied to show that the numerical method converges to the solution of the SDE. Building upon the pioneering work of Gaines and Lyons, we instead use rough path theory to establish pathwise convergence for a wide class of adaptive numerical methods on general Stratonovich SDEs (with sufficiently smooth vector fields). To our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee that applies to standard solvers, such as the Milstein and Heun methods, with non-previsible step sizes. In our analysis, we require the sequence of adaptive step sizes to be nested and the SDE solver to have unbiased "L\'evy area" terms in its Taylor expansion. We conjecture that for adaptive SDE solvers more generally, convergence is still possible provided the method does not introduce "L\'evy area bias". We present a simple example where the step size control can skip over previously considered times, resulting in the numerical method converging to an incorrect limit (i.e. not the Stratonovich SDE). Finally, we conclude with an experiment demonstrating the accuracy of Heun's method and a newly introduced Splitting Path-based Runge-Kutta scheme (SPaRK) when used with adaptive step sizes.</description>
