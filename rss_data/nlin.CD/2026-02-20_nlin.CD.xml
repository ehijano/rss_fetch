      <title>Design of low-energy transfers in cislunar space using sequences of lobe dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical structures in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) are fundamental for designing low-energy transfers, as they aid in analyzing phase space transport and designing desirable trajectories. This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Phase Description of Mutually Coupled Chaotic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronization of rhythms is ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems, and the demand for data-driven analysis is growing. When rhythms arise from limit cycles, phase reduction theory shows that their dynamics are universally modeled as coupled phase oscillators under weak coupling. This simple representation enables direct inference of inter-rhythm coupling functions from measured time-series data. However, strongly rhythmic chaos can masquerade as noisy limit cycles. In such cases, standard estimators still return plausible coupling functions even though a phase-oscillator model lacks a priori justification. We therefore extend the phase description to the chaotic oscillators. Specifically, we derive a closed equation for the phase difference by defining the phase on a Poincar\'e section and averaging the phase dynamics over invariant measures of the induced return maps. Numerically, the derived theoretical functions are in close agreement with those inferred from time-series data. Consequently, our results justify the applicability of phase description to coupled chaotic oscillators and show that data-driven coupling functions retain clear dynamical meaning in the absence of limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Dissipation as a Resource: Synchronization, Coherence Recovery, and Chaos Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipation is commonly regarded as an obstacle to quantum control, as it induces decoherence and irreversibility. Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling.</description>

      <title>Predicting Generalized Steady States in Aperiodically Forced Mechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of generalized steady states (GSSs) in nonlinear mechanical systems under moderate temporally aperiodic forcing has only been shown recently. Here we derive systematic expansions for such GSSs and construct a numerical algorithm that yields explicit and arbitrarily refinable approximations for GSSs without the need for an initial convergence period. This is to be contrasted with a direct numerical integration of the system, whose convergence is hard to assess or is even undefined for short, transient forcing. When at least the linear part of the equations of motion is known, our GSS algorithm outperforms available data-driven neural-network-based techniques for predicting forced response in structural dynamics problems. In a fully equation-driven setting, our GSS computations are shown to be faster than a direct numerical integration of forced nonlinear finite-element models of beams and shells.</description>

      <title>Data-driven sequential analysis of tipping in high-dimensional complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abrupt transitions ("tipping") in nonlinear dynamical systems are often accompanied by changes in the geometry of the attracting set, but quantifying such changes from partial and noisy observations in high-dimensional systems remains challenging. We address this problem with a sequential diagnostic framework, Data Assimilation-High dimensional Attractor's Structural Complexity (DA-HASC). First, this method reconstructs system's high-dimensional state using data assimilation from limited and noisy observations. Second, we quantify a structural complexity of the high-dimensional system dynamics from the reconstructed state by manifold learning. Third, we capture underlying changes in the system by splitting the reconstructed timeseries into sliding windows and analyzing the changes in the temporally local attractor's structural complexity. The structural information is provided as graph Laplacian and measured by Von Neumann entropy in this framework. We evaluate DA-HASC on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate that it can detect tipping under high-dimensionality and imperfect system knowledge. We further discuss how this framework behaves across different tipping mechanisms.</description>

      <title>On Thermalization in A Nonlinear Variant of the Discrete NLS Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermalization properties of a fully nonlinear lattice model originally derived from the two-dimensional cubic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) using analytical and numerical methods. Our analysis reveals both ergodic and nonergodic regimes; importantly, we find broad parameter ranges where the dynamics is ergodic even though it lies outside the Gibbsian parameter regime (for both $D=0.25$ and $D=2$), and a higher-energy range where ergodicity breaks down. We observe that in a certain range of parameters, the system requires non-standard statistical descriptions, indicating a breakdown of conventional thermalization. We examine the influence of the nonlinear dispersion parameter $D$ on the system's behavior, showing that increasing $D$ enhances fluctuations and speeds up the crossover of $q(T)$ toward the $\sim 1/T$ scaling. By analyzing excursion times, probability density functions, and localization patterns, we characterize transitions between ergodic and nonergodic behavior. In long-time numerical simulations within the non-ergodic regime for $D&gt;1$, stable localization over two sites is observed, while $D&lt;1$ favors single-site localization in the high energy density regimes. Our results provide insights into the interplay between thermalization, localization, and non-standard statistical behavior in genuinely nonlinear systems.</description>
