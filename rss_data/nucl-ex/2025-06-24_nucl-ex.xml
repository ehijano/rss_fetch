      <title>The measurement of the $^{99}$Tc $\beta$-decay spectrum and its implications for the effective value of weak axial coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of $\beta$-spectral shapes is an important way to examine the effective value of the weak axial coupling $g_{\rm A}$. These stu\ dies focus specifically on forbidden non-unique $\beta^-$ transitions, as only in these cases is the spectral shape directly sensitive to th\ e ratio $g_{\rm A}/g_{\rm V}$. Here, the value of the weak vector coupling constant, $g_{\rm V}$, is fixed at 1.0 according to the Conserve\ d Vector Current (CVC) hypothesis. In previous studies for the fourth-forbidden non-unique $\beta^-$ decays of $^{113}$Cd [J.~Kostensalo \textit{et al.}, Phys. Lett. B 822, 136652 (2021)] and $^{115}$In [A.~F. Leder \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 232502 \ (2022) and L. Pagnanini \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 122501 (2024)] a quenched value was determined for the ratio $g_{\rm A}/g_{\rm V}$ using $g_{\rm V}=1.0$. A notable exception is the recent measurement and analysis of the second-forbidden non-unique $\ \beta$-decay transition in $^{99}$Tc, performed by M. Paulsen \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. C 110, 05503(2024). Where an enhanced ratio $g_{\\ rm A}/g_{\rm V}=1.526(92)$ was suggested. To resolve this apparently contradictory situation with the effective value of $g_{\rm A}$, we hav\ e performed calculations based on the nuclear shell model (NSM) Hamiltonians glekpn, jj45pnb, and the MQPM approach with a careful considera\ tion of the small relativistic vector nuclear matrix element (sNME). The theoretical spectra were compared to the $^{99}$Tc $\beta$-decay sp\ ectrum by using the 4$\pi$ gold absorber with a Metallic Magnetic Calorimeter (MMC). In all cases, we found that the data matches well with \ reduced $g_{\rm A}$/$g_{\rm V}$ values of 1.0--1.2. Our result contradicts the previously reported measurement for $^{99}$Tc and instead sup\ ports a quenched axial coupling as reported for other isotopes.</description>

      <title>New Determination of the $^{14}$C(n, $\gamma$)$^{15}$C Reaction Rate and Its Astrophysical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel experiment to investigate the spectroscopic factor of the $^{15}$C ground state for the first time using single-neutron $removal$ transfer reactions on $^{15}$C. Two consistent spectroscopic factors were derived from the (p, d) and (d, t) reactions, which were subsequently used to deduce the $^{14}$C(n, $\gamma$)$^{15}$C reaction cross section and the corresponding stellar reaction rate. A typical cross section of (3.89 $\pm$ 0.76) $\mu$b is determined at $E_\mathrm{_{c.m.}}$ = 23.3 keV. At the temperature range of 0.01-4 GK, our new reaction rate is 2.4-3.7 times higher than that of the first direct measurement and 20\%-25\% lower than that of the most recent direct measurement, respectively. Moreover, it is interesting that we can associate a long-standing nuclear structure issue, i.e., the so-called ``quenching'' effect, with this astrophysically relevant reaction. Finally, motivated by astrophysical interests of this reaction decades ago, implications of our new rate on several astrophysical problems are evaluated using state-of-the-art theoretical models. Our calculations demonstrate that the abundances of $^{14}$N and $^{15}$N can be enhanced in the inner regions of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, though with minimal impact on the chemical compositions of the interstellar medium. In the inhomogeneous Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the updated reaction rate can lead to a $\sim 20\%$ variation in the final yields of $^{15}$N in neutron rich regions. For the $r$-process in the core-collapse supernovae, a slight difference of $\sim 0.2\%$ in the final abundances of heavy elements with $A &gt; 90$ can be found by using our new rate.</description>

      <title>Imaging nuclear shape through anisotropic and radial flow in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most atomic nuclei exhibit ellipsoidal shapes characterized by quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$ and triaxiality $\gamma$, and sometimes even a pear-like octupole deformation $\beta_3$. The STAR experiment introduced a new "imaging-by-smashing" technique [arXiv:2401.06625, arXiv:2501.16071] to image the nuclear global shape by colliding nuclei at ultra-relativistic speeds and analyzing outgoing debris. Features of nuclear shape manifest in collective observables like anisotropic flow $v_n$ and radial flow via mean transverse momentum $[p_T]$. We present new measurements of the variances of $v_n$ ($n=2$, 3, and 4) and $[p_T]$, and the covariance of $v_n^2$ with $[p_T]$, in collisions of highly deformed $^{238}$U and nearly spherical $^{197}$Au. Ratios of these observables between these two systems effectively suppress common final-state effects, isolating the strong impact of uranium's deformation. Comparing results with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model calculations, we extract $\beta_{2U}$ and $\gamma_{U}$ values consistent with those deduced from low-energy nuclear structure measurements. Measurements of $v_3$ and its correlation with $[p_T]$ also provide the first experimental suggestion of a possible octupole deformation for $^{238}$U. These findings provide significant support for using high-energy collisions to explore nuclear shapes on femtosecond timescales, with broad implications for both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma studies.</description>

      <title>UrQMD Simulations of Higher-order Cumulants in Au+Au Collisions at High Baryon Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High moments of conserved quantities such as net-baryon, net-electric charge, and net-strangeness in heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to fluctuations caused by the QCD critical point (CP). The event-by-event analysis of high moments of the conserved charges has been widely used in experiments to search for the CP, especially in the RHIC-STAR experiment.
  In order to establish a {\it dynamical non-critical base line}, especially at the high baryon density region, we have performed a systematic analysis of the proton multiplicity distributions from Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq$ $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $\leq$ 9.2 GeV collisions. The results on beam energy, centrality and rapidity width dependence of proton (factorial) cumulants, up to the $4^{th}$ order, are extracted from the calculations of the hadronic transport model UrQMD. In addition, the effects of initial volume fluctuation is also discussed. These results will be important when we do physics analysis the RHIC beam energy scan (BES) data, especially for the fixed-target data and experimental data from future CBM experiment at FAIR.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Cold QCD: Review and Future Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review examines data from hadron-nucleus collisions, primarily focusing on hard processes like Drell-Yan, heavy flavor and quarkonium production. It highlights observed modifications of particle yields as functions of momentum and rapidity, aiming to clarify the underlying QCD effects in cold nuclear matter (CNM). The paper outlines strategies for future experiments, including the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), to distinguish between these effects. Key questions address the universality of suppression mechanisms and the role of non-perturbative physics, providing a road map for upcoming nuclear data.</description>

      <title>System size dependence of charged hadrons directed flow at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV using a multi-phase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The directed flow ($v_1$) of charged hadrons ($h^{\pm}$) in symmetric collision systems (O+O, Cu+Cu, Zr+Zr, Ru+Ru, Au+Au, and U+U) at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 200 GeV using string-melting version of A Multiphase Transport (AMPT-SM) model is reported. The $v_1$ as a function of pseudo-rapidity ($\eta$) is obtained for transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) ranges of 0.2-2.0 GeV/$c$ and 2.0-5.0 GeV/$c$. The dependence of $v_1$-slope ($dv_1/d\eta$) at mid-rapidity on $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range, collision centrality, and system size are discussed particularly in the context of the hard-soft asymmetry in the flow profiles of produced particles. In the AMPT-SM model, a system size independence of the magnitude of $dv_1/d\eta$ between Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at low-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ is observed, and this finding is similar to the observation from the STAR experiment at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 200 GeV. In contrast, a strong centrality and system size dependence, with the opposite sign of $dv_1/d\eta$, is found for the high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ charged hadrons. The AMPT-SM model demonstrates a clear violation of the expected scaling of charged hadrons $(dv_1/d\eta)/A^{1/3}$ across different colliding systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the neutron-proton effective mass splitting via heavy ion collisions: Constraints and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron-proton effective mass splitting ($\Delta m^*_{np}$) is investigated through analyses of heavy-ion collisions using the improved quantum molecular dynamics (ImQMD) model with both standard and extended Skyrme interactions. By uncovering the strong correlation between the slope of the neutron-to-proton yield ratio with respect to the kinetic energy (i.e., $S_{n/p} $) and $\Delta m^*_{np}$, we reveal that the constraints of the neutron-proton effective mass splitting via heavy ion collisions depend on the kinetic energy region of the emitted nucleons. At low kinetic energies, the data favor $m_n^*&gt;m_p^*$ which is consistent with the nucleon-nucleus scattering analysis, while at high kinetic energies, they favor $m_n^*&lt;m_p^*$. Our findings partly resolve the longstanding discrepancy in the constraints of neutron-proton effective mass splitting with heavy ion collisions and nucleon-nucleus scattering, and significantly advance the understanding of nucleon effective mass splitting through heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Rotating Nuclei using Quantum Variational Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum variational algorithms (QVAs) are becoming increasingly potent tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, in particular, on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The application of QVAs, more especially the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), to schematic model simulation is examined in this work. The cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky (CNS) framework serves as a foundation for comprehending high-spin phenomena in deformed nuclei. Using single-particle level spacings, pairing correlations, cranking (rotational) terms, and particle-number conservation, we build five increasingly complex CNS-like models. Quantum-classical hybrid procedures are used to solve these Hamiltonians after mapping them to qubit operators. Key metrics such as ground state energy, angular momentum expectation values $J_x$, and entanglement entropy are used to compare the results to exact diagonalization (ED). With variational errors typically $&lt;0.005$, our results show agreement in energy and angular momentum predictions. Notably, we find slight variances in entanglement entropy between the ED and VQE results, which are influenced by numerical precision and ansatz expressivity. These results open the door to investigating larger, more realistic CNS-type systems through more expressive ansatz and validate the use of variational quantum algorithms in modelling rotational nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Concept of the UCN Source at the WWR-K Reactor (AlSUN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the concept of the ultracold neutron (UCN) source with a superfluid helium-4 converter located in the thermal column of the WWR-K research reactor at the Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The conceptual design is based on the idea of accumulating UCNs in the source and effectively transporting them to experimental setups. We propose to improve the UCN density in the source by separating the heat and the UCN flows from the production volume and decreasing both, the temperature of the SuperFluid $ ^{ 4 }$He (SF $ ^{ 4 }$He) converter below $\sim$1 K and the coefficient of UCN wall loss below $\sim$$ 10^{ -4 }$. To achieve the operation temperatures below 1 K we plan to use a He-3 pumping cryogenic system and minimize the thermal load on the UCN accumulation trap walls. Additional gain in the total number of accumulated UCNs can be achieved due to use of a material of a high critical velocity for the walls of the accumulation trap. The implementation of such a design critically depends on the availability of materials with specific UCN and cryogenic properties. This paper describes the conceptual design of the source, discusses its implementation methods and material requirements, and plans for material testing studies.</description>

      <title>Inferring Neutron Star Nuclear Properties from Gravitational-Wave and Gamma-Ray Burst Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of long gamma-ray bursts accompanied by kilonova emission prompted interest in understanding their progenitors. If these long-duration bursts arise from neutron star mergers, similar to short gamma-ray bursts, it raises the question of which physical properties govern burst duration. The mass of the merger stands out as a key factor, strongly influencing the lifetime of the merger remnant, which in turn determines the burst duration: lighter mergers that form long-lived remnants produce short bursts, whereas more massive mergers result in short-lived remnants that collapse into black holes, powering longer bursts. In this paper, we compare merger rates from gravitational-wave observations of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with the rates of kilonova-associated long and short gamma-ray bursts, to identify a characteristic total neutron star mass that separates the two burst classes at $1.36^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (median and 68\% confidence interval) times of the neutron star Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass. This result suggests that massive neutron stars could survive an extended period after merger. Our findings are robust against substantial observational uncertainties and model assumptions. Moreover, we uncover correlations among various characteristic masses tied to dense nuclear matter, introducing a novel and independent approach to constrain neutron star nuclear properties through separated and combined gravitational-wave and gamma-ray burst observations.</description>

      <title>Existence of nuclear modifications on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been assumed that nuclear modification does not exist in the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$ in lepton deep inelastic scattering. This assumption is widely used in obtaining structure functions of the ``nucleon" from nuclear data such as the deuteron ones. However, nuclear modifications do exist theoretically at least at medium- and large-$x$ regions because nucleons in a nucleus move in any direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction of the virtual-photon or weak-boson momentum in lepton scattering. Because of this transverse motion, the nucleon's transverse and longitudinal structure functions should mix with each other in nuclei with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this work, numerical results are explicitly shown on such nuclear modifications in the deuteron. These nuclear modifications are important for determining precise structure functions of the nucleon. Furthermore, modifications of $R_N$ should be investigated also at small $x$ by the future electron-ion collider to find interesting gluon dynamics in nuclei. Hopefully, this nuclear effect on $R_N$ could be found by future experimental measurements at lepton accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Nuclear and neutron matter in the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory with next-to-leading order covariant chiral nuclear force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are investigated by the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory with the covariant chiral nuclear forces up to the next-to-leading order~(NLO). A fitting scheme to ensure the naturalness of the low-energy constants is proposed, which plays a crucial role in the proper description of nuclear matter. With a momentum cutoff $\Lambda=590$ MeV, the empirical saturation energy and density, as well as the incompressibility coefficient at the saturation density are reproduced well. The EoSs show less dependence on the momentum cutoff and become softer at densities above saturation density, in comparison with the previous leading order results. Given the good description for the saturation properties of nuclear matter, the present work encourages future studies of the finite nuclei in the framework of the RBHF theory with the NLO covariant chiral nuclear forces.</description>

      <title>A new beamline for Resonant Excitation of Beams with Electromagnetic fields and Lasers (REBEL) and Stopping and Trapping of Radioactive Isotopes for Precision Experiments (STRIPE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two newly constructed experimental setups - REBEL (Resonant Excitation of Beams with Electromagnetic fields and Lasers) and STRIPE (Stopping and Trapping of Radioactive Isotopes for Precision Experiments) - integrated into a single offline beamline at KU Leuven. REBEL is designed for collinear laser spectroscopy of ion bunches following isobaric separation with a multireflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer, enabling high-sensitivity measurements of mass-selected fast-ion beams. In contrast, STRIPE focuses on the deceleration, trapping, and laser cooling of ions in a segmented linear Paul trap, optimized for long interrogation times and precision spectroscopy. The shared infrastructure features stable high-voltage operation ($&lt;10$ ppm), modular vacuum sections, and a fast-beam switchyard to route ions to either experiment. Initial results include a mass-resolving power of $R \approx 12900$ in REBEL and successful ion trapping and laser cooling of ions with a kinetic energy of 10 keV in STRIPE, with improved performance achieved using a frequency-modulated cooling laser. This dual-system platform enables the development and benchmarking of advanced spectroscopy and trapping techniques and is compatible with future operation at radioactive ion beam facilities.</description>

      <title>Correlation between particle spectra and elliptic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new observable to probe the collective nature of the radial expansion of the quark-gluon plasma. This observable, dubbed $v_{02}(p_T)$, represents the correlation of the spectrum with elliptic flow, in the same way as the recently measured $v_0(p_T)$ represents the correlation of the spectrum with the transverse momentum per particle. The advantage of $v_{02}(p_T)$ over $v_0(p_T)$ is that it is measured using a three-particle cumulant, as opposed to a pair correlation, which significantly reduces the sensitivity to nonflow effects. We predict non-trivial differences between $v_{02}(p_T)$ and $v_0(p_T)$ in semi-central Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) on the basis of hydrodynamic simulations. A hint of these differences can be seen in the modification of $p_T$ spectra observed by ALICE in event-shape-engineered events a decade ago.</description>

      <title>Implication of odd-even staggering in the charge radii of calcium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the profoundly observed odd-even staggering and the inverted parabolic-like shape in charge radii along calcium isotopic chain, the ground state properties of calcium isotopes are investigated by constraining the root-mean-square (rms) charge radii under the covariant energy density functionals with effective forces NL3 and PK1. In this work, the pairing correlations are tackled by solving the state-dependent Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equations. The calculated results suggest that the binding energies obtained by the radius constraint method have been slightly changed by about $0.2\%$. But for charge radii, the corresponding results deriving from NL3 and PK1 forces have been increased by about $1.0\%$ and $2.0\%$, respectively. This means that charge radius is a more sensitive quantity in the calibrated protocol. Meanwhile, it is found that the reproduced charge radii of calcium isotopes are attributed to the rather strong isospin dependence of effective potential. The odd-even oscillation behavior can also be presented in the proton Fermi energies along calcium isotopic family, but keep opposite trends with respect to the corresponding binding energies and charge radii. As encountered in charge radii, the weakened odd-even oscillation behavior is still emerged from the proton Fermi energies at the neutron numbers $N=20$ and $28$ as well, but not in binding energies.</description>

      <title>Shell quenching in nuclear charge radii based on Monte Carlo dropout Bayesian neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge radii can be generally used to encode information about various fine structures of finite nuclei. In this work, a constructed Bayesian neural network based on the Monte Carlo dropout approach is proposed to accurately describe the charge radii of nuclei with proton number $Z\geq20$ and mass number $A\geq40$. More motivated underlying mechanisms are incorporated into this combined model in addition to the basic building blocks with the specific number of protons and neutrons, which naturally contain the pairing effect, the isospin effect, the shell closure effect associated with the Casten factor $P$, the valence neutrons, the valence protons, the quadrupole deformation $\beta_{20}$, the high order hexadecapole deformation $\beta_{40}$, and the local shape staggering effect of $^{181,183,185}$Hg. To avoid the distorted cases of the traditional Casten factor at the fully filled shells, the modified Casten factor $P^{*}$ is introduced into the input structure parameter sets. The standard root-mean-square deviation is reduced to $0.0084$ fm for the training data set and $0.0124$ fm for the validation data set with the modified Casten factor $P^{*}$. Meanwhile, the shell closure effect of nuclear charge radii can be reproduced remarkably well. We have successfully demonstrated the ability of this constructed model to significantly increase the accuracy in predicting the nuclear charge radii.</description>

      <title>Modelling Coincident Particle Production in Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of coincident particle production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. In particular, we present the first detailed and differential predictions for coincident $\rho^0$ meson production in association with muon pair production, motivated by the recent ATLAS measurement of this process. These are found to describe the data very well, including the dependence of the coincidence fraction on the ZDC selection and/or other kinematic constraints on the muons. Differential predictions at the level of various kinematic variables are presented, and the calculation is made publicly available in the SuperChic MC generator. We also present general results for coincident two-photon initiated production focussing on muon and electron pair production; while the former is rather suppressed, the latter will be ubiquitous at threshold. The impact of coincident production on exclusivity vetos in ultraperipheral measurements is in addition discussed.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic systems for the TUCAN EDM experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The TUCAN (TRIUMF UltraCold Advanced Neutron) Collaboration is completing a new ultracold neutron (UCN) source. The UCN source will deliver UCNs to a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) experiment. The EDM experiment is projected to be capable of an uncertainty of $1\times 10^{-27}~e$cm, competitive with other planned projects, and a factor of ten more precise than the present world's best. The TUCAN source is based on a UCN production volume of superfluid helium (He-II), held at 1~K, and coupled to a proton-driven spallation target. The production rate in the source is expected to be in excess of $10^7$~UCN/s; since UCN losses can be small in superfluid helium, this should allow us to build up a large number of UCNs. The spallation-driven superfluid helium technology is the principal aspect making the TUCAN project unique. The superfluid production volume was recently cooled, for the first time, and successfully filled with superfluid helium. The design principles of the UCN source are described, along with some of the challenging cryogenic milestones that were recently passed.</description>

      <title>Studying Maximal Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to test quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). By computing the spin correlations in quark-antiquark pairs produced via photon-gluon fusion, we find that longitudinally polarized photons produce maximal entanglement at leading order, while transversely polarized photons generate significant entanglement near the threshold and in the ultra-relativistic regime. Compared to hadron colliders, the EIC provides a cleaner experimental environment for measuring entanglement through the $\gamma^\ast g \to q\bar{q}$ channel, offering a strong signal and a promising avenue to verify Bell nonlocality. This study extends entanglement measurements to the EIC, presenting new opportunities to explore the interplay of quantum information phenomena and hadronic physics in the EIC era.</description>

      <title>Simulation studies of the isovector reorientation effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isovector reorientation (IVR) effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target provides a novel means to probe the nuclear isovector potential, which gives rise to the nuclear symmetry energy. The simulation studies on the experimental measurement of IVR effect using the SAMURAI terminal at RIKEN Nishina center have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the experiment. By introducing a well-designed polarimeter to detect the $\mathrm{p}(\vec{\mathrm{d}}, \mathrm{d})\mathrm{p}$ elastic scattering, monitoring of the tensor polarization of the deuteron beam can be implemented. The protons and neutrons produced by the breakup of polarized deuterons scattering off heavy targets are designed to be measured by proton drift chamber (PDC) combined with the SAMURAI magnet and NEBULA detector, respectively. The detector responses are simulated using Geant4 framework, where the events of the deuteron elastic breakup are generated by an Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. The results of reconstructing the deuteron breakup events demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the IVR effect at SAMURAI with both longitudinal and transverse tensor polarized deuteron beams with a polarization degree of approximately 80\%.</description>
