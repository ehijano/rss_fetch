      <title>Nonlinear thermoelectric effects as a means to probe quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which has the quantum metric and Berry curvature as its real and imaginary parts, plays a key role in the transport properties of condensed matter systems. In the nonlinear regime, the quantum metric dipole and Berry curvature dipole provide two distinct mechanisms for generating nonlinear Hall effects, which can both be experimentally observed in systems with suitable symmetries. In this work, we investigate the role of quantum geometry in nonlinear thermoelectric responses. We derive a series of nonlinear thermoelectric effects governed by the Berry curvature dipole and the quantum metric dipole, respectively. Among them, we identify a particularly interesting quantized thermoelectric response that directly measures the total chirality of Weyl points below the Fermi level. For general nonlinear responses, we derive the nonlinear analogs of the Wiedemann-Franz law and Mott's formula. These provide a means to estimate the magnitude of nonlinear thermoelectric responses based on existing nonlinear Hall measurements. Our estimates suggest that these effects should be observable in several candidate materials, with In-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te standing out as the most promising. Our work offers new insights into the experimental study of quantum geometry through nonlinear thermoelectric measurements.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Coupling-Induced Quantum Phase Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum phase transition arises from competition between different ground states and is typically accessed by varying a single physical parameter near absolute zero temperature. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect with high Chern number C has recently been achieved in magnetic topological insulator (TI) multilayers. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI penta-layers by varying the thickness of the middle magnetic TI layer, designated as m quintuple layers. Electrical transport measurements demonstrate a quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states. For m 1 and m 2, the sample exhibits the well-quantized C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states, respectively. For 1 m 2, we observe a monotonic decrease in Hall resistance from h/e2 to h/2e2 with increasing m, accompanied by a peak in the longitudinal resistance. The quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states is attributed to the weakening of the interlayer coupling between the top and the bottom C = 1 QAH layers. Our findings provide a scalable strategy for engineering QAH devices with a tunable Chern number. This approach enables precise control and enhanced functionality in chiral edge current-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Twist Engineering of Anisotropic Excitonic and Optical Properties of a Two-Dimensional Magnetic Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors are a new class of quantum materials for studying the emergent physics of excitons and spins in the 2D limit. Twist engineering provides a powerful tool to manipulate the fundamental properties of 2D vdW materials. Here, we show that twist engineering of the anisotropic ferromagnetic monolayer semiconductor, CrSBr, leads to bilayer magnetic semiconductors with continuously tunable magnetic moment, dielectric anisotropy, exciton energy and linear dichroism. We furthermore provide a model for exciton energy in the media with tunable anisotropy. These results advance fundamental studies on 2D vdW materials and open doors to applications to nano-optics, twistronics, and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Wilson polygons and the topology of zero-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that zero-dimensional (0-D) systems can host non-trivial topology analogous to macroscopic topological materials in greater dimensions. Unlike macroscopic periodic systems with translational symmetry, zero-dimensional materials such as molecules, clusters and quantum dots can exhibit discrete rotation symmetry. The eigenstates can thus be grouped into discrete bands and Bloch-like wave functions. Since the symmetry is discrete, the Berry phase and the topological indices must be defined by discrete Wilson polygons. Here, we demonstrate non-trivial Z2 orders in two representative 0-D molecules, [m]-Cycloparaphenylene and [m]-iso-thianaphthene, where topological transitions occur when modifying the coupling between the repeating units. Similar to macroscopic topological systems in greater dimensions, localized boundary states emerge in composite nanohoops formed by segments that are topologically distinct. This opens up the possibility of non-trivial topological phases in 0-D systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning relaxation and nonlinear upconversion of valley-exciton-polaritons in a monolayer semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling exciton relaxation and energy conversion pathways via their coupling to photonic modes is a central task in cavity-mediated quantum materials research. In this context, the light-matter hybridization in optical cavities can lead to intriguing effects, such as modified carrier transport, enhancement of optical quantum yield, and control of chemical reaction pathways. Here, we investigate the impact of the strong light-matter coupling regime on energy conversion, both in relaxation and upconversion schemes, by utilizing a strongly charged MoSe2 monolayer embedded in a spectrally tunable open-access cavity. We find that the charge carrier gas yields a significantly modified photoluminescence response of cavity exciton-polaritons, dominated by an intra-cavity like pump scheme. In addition, upconversion luminescence emerges from a population transfer from fermionic trions to bosonic exciton-polaritons. Due to the availability of multiple optical modes in the tunable open cavity, it seamlessly meets the cavity-enhanced double resonance condition required for an efficient upconversion. The latter can be actively tuned via the cavity length in-situ, displaying nonlinear scaling in intensity and fingerprints of the valley polarization. This suggests mechanisms that include both trion-trion Auger scattering and phonon absorption as its underlying microscopic origin.</description>

      <title>Stable self-charged perovskite quantum rods for liquid laser with near-zero threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising optical gain materials that require further threshold reduction to realize their full potential. While QD charging theoretically reduces the threshold to zero, its effectiveness has been limited by strong Auger recombination and unstable charging. Here we theoretically reveal the optimal combination of charging number and Auger recombination to minimize the lasing threshold. Experimentally, we develop stable self-charged perovskite quantum rods (QRs) as an alternative to QDs via state engineering and Mn-doping strategy. An unprecedented two-order-of-magnitude reduction in nonradiative Auger recombination enables QRs to support a sufficient charging number of up to 6. The QR liquid lasing is then achieved with a near-zero threshold of 0.098 using quasi-continuous pumping of nanosecond pulses, which is the lowest threshold among all reported QD lasers. These achievements demonstrate the potential of the specially engineered QRs as an excellent gain media and pave the way for their prospective applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical control of random telegraph noise in magnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid random telegraph noise (RTN) in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is an important figure of merit for probabilistic computing applications. However, the interactions between the macrospin and spin waves with finite wave numbers reduce the RTN attempt frequency. We theoretically show that mode-selective heating and cooling can substantially tune the RTN frequency. We propose a nonlinear cooling mechanism that accelerates the switching dynamics. We outline experimental pathways to characterize the physics of nonlinear effects on RTN and to maximize the operation speed of MTJ-based probabilistic computing.</description>

      <title>Differentiating anomalous and topological Hall effects using first-order reversal curve measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next generation magnetic memories rely on novel magnetic phases for information storage. Novel spin textures such as skyrmions provide one possible avenue forward due to their topological protection and controllability via electric fields. However, the common signature of these spin textures, the topological Hall effect (THE), can be mimicked by other trivial effects. Competing anomalous Hall effect (AHE) components can produce a peak in the Hall voltage similar to that of the THE, making clear identification of the THE difficult. By applying the first-order reversal curve (FORC) technique to the Hall effect in candidate topological Hall systems we can clearly distinguish between the THE and AHE. This technique allows for quantitative investigation of the THE and AHE in magnetic materials and heterostructures with topologically non-trivial spin textures. We demonstrate the technique and apply it to several examples.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian band topology in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) topological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping on both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated only on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass term breaks the $C_{2}$ symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing a valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this system transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals that, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH effects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as we enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity $(\beta)$. At the magic angle, we observe that enhancement of $\beta$ inflates the robustness of the gapless Dirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the NH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of twist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the topological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the Moir\'e Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We find that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with corresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic band splitting in 10 nm epitaxial CrSb thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a newly identified family of collinear antiferromagnets with momentum-dependent spin-split band structure of non-relativistic origin, derived from spin-group symmetry-protected crystal structures. Among candidate altermagnets, CrSb is attractive for potential applications because of a large spin-splitting near the Fermi level and a high Neel transition temperature of around 700 K. We use molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize CrSb (0001) thin films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm. Structural characterization, using reflection high energy electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, demonstrates the growth of epitaxial films with good crystallinity. Polarized neutron reflectometry shows the absence of any net magnetization, consistent with antiferromagnetic order. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements probe the band structure in a previously unexplored regime of film thickness, down to 10 nm. These ARPES measurements show a three-dimensional momentum-dependent band splitting of up to 1 eV with g-wave symmetry, consistent with that seen in prior studies of bulk single crystals. The distinct altermagnetic band structure required for potential spin-transport applications survives down to the 10 nm thin film limit at room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a method for measuring correlations of wideband magnetic signals with spatial resolution below the optical diffraction limit. Our technique employs two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale magnetometers, spectrally resolved by inhomogeneous optical transitions. Using high-fidelity optical readout and long spin coherence time, we probe correlated MHz-range noise with sensitivity of 15 nT Hz$^{-1/4}$. In addition, we use this system for correlated $T_1$ relaxometry, enabling correlation measurements of GHz-range noise. Under such externally applied noise, while individual NV centers exhibit featureless relaxation, their correlation displays rich coherent and incoherent dynamics reminiscent of superradiance physics. This capability to probe high-frequency correlations provides a powerful tool for investigating a variety of condensed-matter phenomena characterized by nonlocal correlations.</description>

      <title>Tripartite hybrid quantum systems: Skyrmion-mediated quantum interactions between single NV centers and superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and superconducting qubits are two promising solid-state quantum systems for quantum science and technology, but the realization of controlled interfaces between individual solid-state spins and superconducting qubits remains fundamentally challenging. Here, we propose and analyze a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic skyrmion, an NV center, and a superconducting qubit, where the solid-state qubits are both positioned in proximity to the skyrmion structure in a thin magnetic disk. We show that it is experimentally feasible to achieve strong magnetic (coherent or dissipative) coupling between the NV center and the superconducting qubit by using the \textit{quantized gyration mode of the skyrmion} as an intermediary. This allows coherent information transfer and nonreciprocal responses between the NV center and the superconducting qubit at the single quantum level with high controllability. The proposed platform provides a scalable pathway for implementing quantum protocols that synergistically exploit the complementary advantages of spin-based quantum memories, microwave-frequency superconducting circuits, and topologically protected magnetic excitations.</description>

      <title>Topology of Discrete Quantum Feedback Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general framework for analyzing the topology of quantum channels of single-particle systems is developed to find a class of genuinely dynamical topological phases that can be realized by means of discrete quantum feedback control. We provide a symmetry classification of quantum channels by identifying ten symmetry classes of discrete quantum feedback control with projective measurements. We construct various types of topological feedback control by using topological Maxwell demons that achieve robust feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence. Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors and their moir\'e superlattices have emerged as important platforms for investigating correlated electrons. However, many key properties of these systems, such as the frequency-dependent conductivity, remain experimentally inaccessible because of the mesoscopic sample size. Here we report a technique to directly measure the complex conductivity of electrostatically gated two-dimensional semiconductors in the terahertz frequency range. Applying this technique to a WSe2 monolayer encapsulated in hBN, we observe clear Drude-like response between 0.1 and 1 THz, in a density range challenging to access even in DC transport. Our work opens a new avenue for studying tunable van der Waals heterostructures using terahertz spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Piezomagnetic Effects in $g$-wave Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the generation of net magnetization induced by static strain in $g$-wave altermagnets, which exhibit the symmetric spin-split band structure under collinear spin textures free from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling. By analyzing a tight-binding model in a two-dimensional tetragonal system, we show that the $g$-wave altermagnets give rise to the nonlinear piezomagnetic effect, where a net magnetization is induced by the second-order strain. We compare the results for the $g$-wave altermagnets with those for the $d$-wave altermagnets, where the linear piezomagnetic effect occurs. As a result, we find that the induced magnetization is enhanced when the Fermi level lies on the band with the large spin splitting in both cases. We also show that the magnitudes of the induced magnetization are comparable to each other. Our results indicate that the nonlinear piezomagnetic effect is a good phenomenon to characterize the physical properties in $g$-wave altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Energy symmetry and interlayer wave function ratio of tunneling electrons in partially overlapped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the exponential decay of tunneling probability with barrier thickness is well known, the accompanying oscillations with thickness have been comparatively less explored. Using a tight binding model, we investigate an AB-stacked bilayer graphene region acting as an energy barrier between two monolayer graphene leads, under a vertical electric field. We discuss the case where the energy gap induced by the vertical electric field is comparable to the interlayer transfer integral. In the up (down) junction, the left and right monolayer leads are connected to different layers (a common layer) of the central bilayer, while the remaining, unconnected layers form armchair-type open edges. We reveal a characteristic relation between the tunneling probability and the wave function structure. Among the valley-resolved transmission probabilities, only the valley-reversed transmission in the up junction exhibits even symmetry with respect to energy $E$. This result is counterintuitive. The interlayer wave function ratio $\beta$ is asymmetric in $E$, i.e., $\beta(-E) \neq \beta(E)$, and electrons cannot bypass the interlayer path in the up junction, whereas they can in the down junction. We attribute this unexpected symmetry to a self-cancellation effect of $\beta$, which arises from chiral and rotational symmetry operations combined with the conservation of probability. Our results demonstrate that the energy dependence of conductance in double junction structures serves as evidence of this effect.</description>

      <title>Hopf Exceptional Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Planar Nernst effect from hidden band geometry in layered two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nernst effect is a versatile phenomenon relevant for energy harvesting, magnetic sensing, probing band topology and charge-neutral excitations. The planar Nernst effect (PNE) generates an in-plane voltage transverse to an applied temperature gradient under an in-plane magnetic field. Conventional Berry curvature-induced PNE is absent in two-dimensional (2D) systems, as the out-of-plane Berry curvature does not couple to the in-plane electron velocity. We challenge this notion by demonstrating a distinct planar Nernst effect in quasi-2D materials (2DPNE). We show that the 2DPNE originates from previously overlooked planar components of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, arising from inter-layer tunneling in multilayered 2D systems. We comprehensively analyze the band-geometric origin and crystalline symmetry constraints on 2DPNE responses. We illustrate its experimental feasibility in strained bilayer graphene. Our findings significantly expand the theoretical understanding of planar Nernst effects, providing a clear pathway for next-generation magnetic sensing and energy-harvesting applications.</description>

      <title>Time-tronics: from temporal printed circuit board to quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

      <title>The effect of oxygen content on the electrophysical properties of the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dependencies of the resistance on the applied voltage of a series of molybdenum-disulfide-oxide (MoSxOy) powders was studied. The MoSxOy samples were prepared by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution followed by aerial oxidation. These materials had the structure of nanoflowers consisting of self-assembled 10-20 nm thin nanoflakes. Chemical composition of the materials was evaluated by XPS and confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The MoSxOy nanoflakes revealed unusual electric transport features. The current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) grew monotonically with the applied voltage for the samples, containing ca. 25 % of Mo in oxidized species (in contrast to MoS2), being non-ohmic at lower voltages and becoming close to the ohmic at higher voltages. On the other hand, the I-V curves acquire N-like shaped with a strongly pronounced negative differential resistivity (NDR) part for the samples containing more than 50 % of Mo in oxidized forms. In all cases the I-V curves manifested hysteretic behavior with the difference between increasing and decreasing voltage sweeps, and the hysteresis loop parameters depended on the Ts. Important, that the studied nanoflakes were characterized by very long living deep charging and discharging after the voltage switching "on" and "off". The flexo-chemical model of the polar and electro-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes was proposed, and the observed I-V curves were theoretically described. The revealed experimentally and explained features of resistive switching and charge accumulation in the MoSxOy materials look promising for applications in memristors and high-performance supercapacitors.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-Driven Interfacial Thermal Transport in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-plane thermal conductivity in homogeneous transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibits a strong dependence on twist angle, originating from atomic reconstruction within moir\'e superlattices. This reconstruction redistributes interlayer stacking modes, reducing high-efficiency thermal transport regions and softening the transverse acoustic phonon modes as the twist angle increases. We propose a general theoretical expression to capture this behavior, validated against non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations across both homo- and heterogeneous twisted TMDs structures, as well as homogeneous twisted graphene and hexagonal boron nitride stacks. Our model demonstrates that the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) scales with the twist angle ($\theta$) as $\ln{\left(\text{ITC}\right)} \propto e^{-\sqrt{\theta}}$. These findings advance the understanding of twist-engineered interfacial thermal transport, offering design principles for optimizing thermal management in devices based on van der Waals layered materials.</description>
