      <title>Optimizing ISAC MIMO Systems with Reconfigurable Pixel Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication demands architectures that can flexibly exploit spatial and electromagnetic (EM) degrees of freedom (DoF). This paper proposes an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) MIMO framework that uses Reconfigurable Pixel Antenna (RPixA), which introduces additional EM-domain DoF that are electronically controlled through binary antenna coder switch networks. We introduce a beamforming architecture combining this EM and digital precoding to jointly optimize Sensing and Communication. Based on full-wave simulation of pixel antenna, we formulate a non-convex joint optimization problem to maximize sensing rate under user-specific constraints on communication rate. We utilize an Alternating Optimization framework incorporating genetic algorithm for port states of Pixel antennas, and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) for digital beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed EM-aware design achieves considerably higher sensing rate compared to conventional arrays and enables considerable antenna reduction for equivalent ISAC performance. These findings highlight the potential of reconfigurable pixel antennas to realize efficient and scalable EM-aware ISAC systems for future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>A Convolutional Framework for Mapping Imagined Auditory MEG into Listened Brain Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding imagined speech engages complex neural processes that are difficult to interpret due to uncertainty in timing and the limited availability of imagined-response datasets. In this study, we present a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset collected from trained musicians as they imagined and listened to musical and poetic stimuli. We show that both imagined and perceived brain responses contain consistent, condition-specific information. Using a sliding-window ridge regression model, we first mapped imagined responses to listened responses at the single-subject level, but found limited generalization across subjects. At the group level, we developed an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with a subject-specific calibration layer that produced stable and generalizable mappings. The CNN consistently outperformed the null model, yielding significantly higher correlations between predicted and true listened responses for nearly all held-out subjects. Our findings demonstrate that imagined neural activity can be transformed into perception-like responses, providing a foundation for future brain-computer interface applications involving imagined speech and music.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)-enabled NOMA Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have emerged as a promising technology due to their ability to dynamically reconfigure wireless propagation environments. A novel PASS-based multi-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework is proposed by exploiting the waveguide-division (WD) transmission characteristic. Specifically, each NOMA user cluster is served by one dedicated waveguide, and the corresponding pinching beamforming is exploited to enhance the intra-cluster performance while mitigating the inter-cluster interference. Based on this framework, a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing power allocation, pinching beamforming, and user scheduling. To solve this problem, a two-step algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems. For the joint power allocation and pinching beamforming design, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm is proposed to obtain the locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the coupling constraints are alleviated through augmented Lagrangian relaxation, and the resulting augmented Lagrangian (AL) problem is decomposed into four subproblems, which are solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. For the user scheduling, a low-complexity matching algorithm is developed to solve the user-to-waveguide assignment problem. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) the proposed PASS-based NOMA framework under the WD transmission structure achieves significant sum-rate gain over conventional fixed-position antenna systems and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme; and 2) the proposed matching-based user scheduling algorithm achieves near-optimal user-waveguide association with low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of 3GPP Release 19 ISAC Channel Modeling: From Empirical Features to Unified Methodology and Standardized Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has been identified as a key 6G application by ITU and 3GPP. Channel measurement and modeling is a prerequisite for ISAC system design and has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. 3GPP Release 19 initiated the ISAC channel study item in December 2023 and finalized its modeling specification in May 2025 after extensive technical discussions. However, a comprehensive survey that provides a systematic overview,from empirical channel features to modeling methodologies and standardized simulators,remains unavailable. In this paper, the key requirements and challenges in ISAC channel research are first analyzed, followed by a structured overview of the standardization workflow throughout the 3GPP Release 19 process. Then, critical aspects of ISAC channels, including physical objects, target channels, and background channels, are examined in depth, together with additional features such as spatial consistency, environment objects, Doppler characteristics, and shared clusters, supported by measurement-based analysis. To establish a unified ISAC channel modeling framework, an Extended Geometry-based Stochastic Model (E-GBSM) is proposed, incorporating all the aforementioned ISAC channel characteristics. Finally, a standardized simulator is developed based on E-GBSM, and a two-phase calibration procedure aligned with 3GPP Release 19 is conducted to validate both the model and the simulator, demonstrating close agreement with industrial reference results. Overall, this paper provides a systematic survey of 3GPP Release 19 ISAC channel standardization and offers insights into best practices for new feature characterization, unified modeling methodology, and standardized simulator implementation, which can effectively supporting ISAC technology evaluation and future 6G standardization.</description>

      <title>Scalable Pixel-based Reconfigurable Beamforming Networks for Designing Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel scalable pixel-based reconfigurable beamforming network (PRBFN) that can be used to form a Fluid Antenna System (FAS), referred to as a PRBFN-FAS, is introduced. The concept of FAS has emerged as an attractive new technology for use in sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems, but most implementations of FAS rely on mechanically reconfigurable antennas which are hindered by inertia, and are therefore too slow to be useful. Using the insight that changing an antenna's physical position is equivalent to switching the excitation current vector of a multi-port antenna, a novel beamformer is proposed with a scalable methodology for incorporating into FAS to form a PRBFN-FAS. Key novelties in creating the PRBFN include selecting the required current vectors and concatenating beamforming networks together to form the desired PRBFN. Two PRBFN-FAS design examples are demonstrated with FAS equivalent physical movements of 0.5 and 1.5 wavelengths. Measurements demonstrate that the PRBFN-FAS provides good matching and Bessel correlation across the desired bandwidth, satisfying FAS requirements. System-level experiments confirm the viability of PRBFN-FAS in practical communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Doppler Robust Vortex Wavefront Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising paradigm for future wireless systems due to spectrum reuse, hardware sharing, and joint waveform design. In dynamic scenes, Doppler shifts degrade both sensing and communication, which is particularly critical for beam-sensitive orbital angular momentum (OAM) wavefronts. To address this, we propose a Doppler-robust ISAC framework, which first senses and then communicates. Specifically, in the sensing phase, multiple vortex modes are simultaneously transmitted via code-division mode-multiplexing (CDMM). To solve Doppler-induced inter-mode interference, we propose a velocity-consistency matching (VCM)-expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that jointly decodes the sensing matrix and estimates range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity for multiple moving targets. In the communication phase, the joint transmitter (Tx) beamforming and receiver (Rx) beam steering are configured from the estimated channel state information (CSI). We further quantify the sensing-communication allocation trade-off by evaluating how pilot length affects estimation accuracy, beam alignment, and spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that the proposed VCM-EM and ISAC designs achieve higher sensing accuracy and communication SE than baseline schemes in dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning Network Sheaves for AI-native Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI call for a paradigm shift from bit-centric communication to goal- and semantics-oriented architectures, paving the way for AI-native 6G networks. In this context, we address a key open challenge: enabling heterogeneous AI agents to exchange compressed latent-space representations while mitigating semantic noise and preserving task-relevant meaning. We cast this challenge as learning both the communication topology and the alignment maps that govern information exchange among agents, yielding a learned network sheaf equipped with orthogonal maps. This learning process is further supported by a semantic denoising end compression module that constructs a shared global semantic space and derives sparse, structured representations of each agent's latent space. This corresponds to a nonconvex dictionary learning problem solved iteratively with closed-form updates. Experiments with mutiple AI agents pre-trained on real image data show that the semantic denoising and compression facilitates AI agents alignment and the extraction of semantic clusters, while preserving high accuracy in downstream task. The resulting communication network provides new insights about semantic heterogeneity across agents, highlighting the interpretability of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Colored Markov Random Fields for Probabilistic Topological Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) encode conditional dependencies among random variables using a graph -nodes for variables, links for dependencies- and factorize the joint distribution into lower-dimensional components. This makes PGMs well-suited for analyzing complex systems and supporting decision-making. Recent advances in topological signal processing highlight the importance of variables defined on topological spaces in several application domains. In such cases, the underlying topology shapes statistical relationships, limiting the expressiveness of canonical PGMs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Colored Markov Random Fields (CMRFs), which model both conditional and marginal dependencies among Gaussian edge variables on topological spaces, with a theoretical foundation in Hodge theory. CMRFs extend classical Gaussian Markov Random Fields by including link coloring: connectivity encodes conditional independence, while color encodes marginal independence. We quantify the benefits of CMRFs through a distributed estimation case study over a physical network, comparing it with baselines with different levels of topological prior.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolding: Recent Developments, Theory, and Design Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization methods play a central role in signal processing, serving as the mathematical foundation for inference, estimation, and control. While classical iterative optimization algorithms provide interpretability and theoretical guarantees, they often rely on surrogate objectives, require careful hyperparameter tuning, and exhibit substantial computational latency. Conversely, machine learning (ML ) offers powerful data-driven modeling capabilities but lacks the structure, transparency, and efficiency needed for optimization-driven inference. Deep unfolding has recently emerged as a compelling framework that bridges these two paradigms by systematically transforming iterative optimization algorithms into structured, trainable ML architectures. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of deep unfolding, presenting a unified perspective of methodologies for converting optimization solvers into ML models and highlighting their conceptual, theoretical, and practical implications. We review the foundations of optimization for inference and for learning, introduce four representative design paradigms for deep unfolding, and discuss the distinctive training schemes that arise from their iterative nature. Furthermore, we survey recent theoretical advances that establish convergence and generalization guarantees for unfolded optimizers, and provide comparative qualitative and empirical studies illustrating their relative trade-offs in complexity, interpretability, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Boolean Matrix Factorization using Integer Programming and Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03807v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) approximates a given binary input matrix as the product of two smaller binary factors. Unlike binary matrix factorization based on standard arithmetic, BMF employs the Boolean OR and AND operations for the matrix product, which improves interpretability and reduces the approximation error. It is also used in role mining and computer vision. In this paper, we first propose algorithms for BMF that perform alternating optimization (AO) of the factor matrices, where each subproblem is solved via integer programming (IP). We then design different approaches to further enhance AO-based algorithms by selecting an optimal subset of rank-one factors from multiple runs. To address the scalability limits of IP-based methods, we introduce new greedy and local-search heuristics. We also construct a new C++ data structure for Boolean vectors and matrices that is significantly faster than existing ones and is of independent interest, allowing our heuristics to scale to large datasets. We illustrate the performance of all our proposed methods and compare them with the state of the art on various real datasets, both with and without missing data, including applications in topic modeling and imaging.</description>

      <title>Movable Signals with Dual-Polarized Fixed Intelligent Surfaces: Beyond Diagonal Reflection Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates wireless systems aided by dual-polarized intelligent surfaces. We compare reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which adjust their reflection matrices, with movable signals operating with fixed intelligent surface (FIS), which adjust the signal frequency while the surface properties remain fixed. For both RIS and FIS, we consider surfaces with a diagonal reflection matrix, named diagonal RIS/FIS, and surfaces with a reflection matrix not limited to being diagonal, named beyond-diagonal RIS/FIS. Movable signals with FIS always outperform RIS, achieving at least a fourfold gain. When transmitter and receiver polarizations differ, beyond-diagonal FIS further enhances performance.</description>

      <title>Semi-Markov Decision Process Framework for Age of Incorrect Information Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a remote estimation system, we study age of incorrect information (AoII), which is a recently proposed semantic-aware freshness metric. In particular, we assume an information source observing a discrete-time finite-state Markov chain (DTMC) and employing push-based transmissions of status update packets towards the monitor which is tasked with remote estimation of the source. The source-to-monitor channel delay is assumed to have a general discrete-time phase-type (DPH) distribution, whereas the zero-delay reverse channel ensures that the source has perfect information on AoII and the remote estimate. A multi-threshold transmission policy is employed where packet transmissions are initiated when the AoII process exceeds a threshold which may be different for each estimation value. In this general setting, our goal is to minimize the weighted sum of time average of an arbitrary function of AoII and estimation, and transmission costs, by suitable choice of the thresholds. We formulate the problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with the same state-space as the original DTMC to obtain the optimum multi-threshold policy whereas the parameters of the SMDP are obtained by using a novel stochastic tool called dual-regime absorbing Markov chain (DR-AMC), and its corresponding absorption time distribution named as dual-regime DPH (DR-DPH).</description>

Abstract: Space exploration has witnessed a steady increase since the 1960s, with Mars playing a significant role in our quest for further knowledge. As the ambition to colonize Mars becomes a reality through the collaboration of private companies and space agencies, the need for reliable and robust communication infrastructures in the Martian environment becomes paramount. In this context, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communication emerges as a promising technology to enhance the coverage due to lack of multipath components in line-of-sight (LOS) dominated Martian environments. By considering various Martian scenarios such as canyons, craters, mountains, and plateaus, this article explores of the potential of RISs in increasing the coverage in Martian environments. The article also provides an overview of RIS-assisted localization in both LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, presenting a general framework for accurate user angle estimation in challenging Martian conditions. The findings and presented framework of this article provide a promising research direction for integrating RISs in deep space communication as well as paving the way for future improvements in interplanetary communication networks.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Signal Detection with Unknown Bandwidths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signal detection in environments with unknown signal bandwidth and time intervals is a fundamental problem in adversarial and spectrum-sharing scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of detecting signals occupying unknown degrees of freedom from non-coherent power measurements, where the signal is constrained to an interval in one dimension or a hyper-cube in multiple dimensions. A GLRT is derived, resulting in a straightforward metric involving normalized average signal energy for each candidate signal set. We present bounds on false alarm and missed detection probabilities, demonstrating their dependence on SNR and signal set sizes. To overcome the inherent computational complexity of exhaustive searches, we propose a computationally efficient binary search method, reducing the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) for one-dimensional cases. Simulations indicate that the method maintains performance near exhaustive searches and achieves asymptotic consistency, with interval-of-overlap converging to one under constant SNR as measurement size increases. The simulation studies also demonstrate superior performance and reduced complexity compared to contemporary neural network-based approaches, specifically outperforming custom-trained U-Net models in spectrum detection tasks.</description>

Abstract: One of the happiest accidents in all math is the ease of transforming a function to and taking derivatives in the Fourier frequency domain. But in order to exploit this extraordinary fact without serious artefacting, and in order to be able to use a computer, we need quite a bit of extra knowledge and care. This document sets out the math behind the spectral-derivatives Python package. I touch on fundamental signal processing and calculus concepts as necessary and build upwards.</description>

      <title>Design of 3D Beamforming and Deployment Strategies for ISAC-based HAPS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores high-altitude platform station (HAPS) systems enabled by integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), in which a HAPS simultaneously transmits communication signals and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging signals to support multi-user communication while performing ground target sensing. Taking into account the operational characteristics of SAR imaging, we consider two HAPS deployment strategies: (i) a quasi-stationary HAPS that remains fixed at an optimized location during SAR operation, following the stop-and-go scanning model; and (ii) a dynamic HAPS that continuously adjusts its flight trajectory along a circular path. For each strategy, we aim at maximizing the weighted sum-rate throughput for communication users while ensuring that SAR imaging requirements, such as beampattern gain and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are satisfied. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the HAPS deployment strategy, i.e., its placement or trajectory, along with three-dimensional (3D) transmit beamforming, under practical constraints including transmit power limits, energy consumption, and flight dynamics. Nevertheless, the formulated optimization problems corresponding to the two deployment strategies are inherently non-convex. To address the issue, we propose efficient algorithms that leverage both convex and non-convex optimization techniques to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approaches over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Downlink Communications Based on Dynamic Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are emerging as a promising technology to enable energy-efficient, large array-based multi-antenna systems. This paper presents a simple channel estimation scheme for the downlink of a multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MISO-OFDM) communication system exploiting DMAs. The proposed scheme extracts separate estimates of the wireless channel and the unknown waveguide propagation vector using a simple iterative algorithm based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. Obtaining decoupled estimates of the wireless channel and inner waveguide vector enables the isolation and compensation for its effect when designing the DMA beamformer, regardless of the wireless channel state, which evolves much faster due to its shorter coherence time and bandwidth. Additionally, our solution operates in a data-aided manner, delivering estimates of useful data symbols jointly with channel estimates, without requiring sequential pilot and data stages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore this CE approach. Numerical results corroborate the notable performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Localization-Based Beam Focusing in Near-Field Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shifting 6G-and-beyond wireless systems to higher frequency bands and the utilization of massive multiple-input multiple-output arrays will extend the near-field region, affecting beamforming and user localization schemes. In this paper, we propose a localization-based beam-focusing design, in which the receive combiners are directly constructed from the steering vectors corresponding to the estimated user locations. To support this approach, we analyze the 2D-MUSIC algorithm by examining its spectrum in simplified, tractable setups with minimal numbers of antennas and users. Lastly, we compare the proposed localization-based beam focusing, with locations estimated via 2D-MUSIC, with pilot-based zero forcing in terms of uplink sum spectral efficiency. Our results show significant gains under dominant line-of-sight propagation, short coherence blocks, and high noise power typical of high-frequency systems.</description>

      <title>Eye Movement Analysis in Simulated Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates eye movement behaviour during three conditions: Baseline, Ride (simulated drive under normal visibility), and Fog (simulated drive under reduced visibility). Eye tracking data are analyzed using 31 parameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate Contour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Specifically, the analysis includes 13 saccade, 13 BCEA, and 5 blinking variables. Across all feature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between Baseline and the driving conditions, particularly between Baseline and Ride or Fog. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (four out of 13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced differences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze stability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional measures such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and entropy metrics, a new parameter, Guzik's Index (GI), is introduced to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the BCEA. This index utilizes eye tracking data to enhance the understanding of eye movement dynamics during driving conditions. Separately from GI, other parameters elicit the largest deviations compared to Ride (e.g., number of saccades: Cliff's {\delta} = 0.98, BCEA: Cohen's d = 0.89, and standard deviation of blink duration: Cliff's {\delta} = 0.80), underscoring the influence of reduced visibility on visual attention. Overall, these findings demonstrate that combining BCEA with saccade and blink parameters provides a comprehensive understanding of visual attention and gaze stability, while GI offers additional insights into fixation asymmetry under varying visibility conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SSMRadNet, the first multi-scale State Space Model (SSM) based detector for Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar that sequentially processes raw ADC samples through two SSMs. One SSM learns a chirp-wise feature by sequentially processing samples from all receiver channels within one chirp, and a second SSM learns a representation of a frame by sequentially processing chirp-wise features. The latent representations of a radar frame are decoded to perform segmentation and detection tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on the RADIal dataset show SSMRadNet has 10-33x fewer parameters and 60-88x less computation (GFLOPs) while being 3.7x faster than state-of-the-art transformer and convolution-based radar detectors at competitive performance for segmentation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision localization and environmental sensing are essential for a new wave of applications, ranging from industrial automation and autonomous systems to augmented reality and remote healthcare. Conventional wireless methods, however, often face limitations in accuracy, reliability, and coverage, especially in complex non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a key enabling technology, offering dynamic control over the radio propagation environment to overcome these challenges. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of RIS-aided localization and sensing, bridging fundamental theory with practical implementation. The core principles of the RIS technology are first described detailing how programmable metasurfaces can intelligently combat blockages, enhance signal diversity, and create virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links. The chapter then reviews a range of application scenarios where RISs can offer significant improvements. A significant portion of the chapter is dedicated to algorithmic methodologies, covering beam sweeping protocols, codebook-based techniques, and advanced optimization and machine learning strategies for both localization and sensing. To validate the theoretical concepts in real-world conditions, recent experimental results using an RIS prototype are detailed, showcasing the technology's efficacy and illustrating key performance trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Scheduling and Aggregation Design for Asynchronous Federated Learning over Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning (ML) framework that combines on-device training and server-based aggregation to train a common ML model among distributed agents. In this work, we propose an asynchronous FL design with periodic aggregation to tackle the straggler issue in FL systems. Considering limited wireless communication resources, we investigate the effect of different scheduling policies and aggregation designs on the convergence performance. Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations. Moreover, we show that an ``age-aware'' aggregation weighting design can significantly improve the learning performance in an asynchronous FL setting.</description>

      <title>Capacity Bounds and Low-Complexity Constellation Shaping under Mixed Gaussian-Impulsive Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the bounds on channel capacity and constellation shaping under memoryless mixed noise, which is composed of impulsive noise (IN) and white Gaussian noise (WGN). The capacity bounds are derived using the entropy power inequality and the dual expression of capacity. It is then shown that the proposed lower and upper bounds asymptotically converge to the true channel capacity, and the analytic asymptotic capacity expression is obtained. Leveraging this property, we design a low-complexity constellation shaping method that operates without iterative procedures. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived bounds are remarkably tight, and the shaped constellation achieves the highest mutual information among all considered baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Implicit Generative Modeling by Kernel Similarity Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes stimuli has been a fundamental problem in computational neuroscience. Insights into this problem have led to the design and development of artificial neural networks that learn representations by incorporating brain-like learning abilities. Recently, learning representations by capturing similarity between input samples has been studied to tackle this problem. This approach, however, has thus far been used to only learn downstream features from an input and has not been studied in the context of a generative paradigm, where one can map the representations back to the input space, incorporating not only bottom-up interactions (stimuli to latent) but also learning features in a top-down manner (latent to stimuli). We investigate a kernel similarity matching framework for generative modeling. Starting with a modified sparse coding objective for learning representations proposed in prior work, we demonstrate that representation learning in this context is equivalent to maximizing similarity between the input kernel and a latent kernel. We show that an implicit generative model arises from learning the kernel structure in the latent space and show how the framework can be adapted to learn manifold structures, potentially providing insights as to how task representations can be encoded in the brain. To solve the objective, we propose a novel Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm and discuss the interpretation of the optimization process. Finally, we discuss how this representation learning problem can lead towards a biologically plausible architecture to learn the model parameters that ties together representation learning using similarity matching (a bottom-up approach) with predictive coding (a top-down approach).</description>

      <title>Analog Computing for Signal Processing and Communications -- Part I: Computing with Microwave Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog computing has been recently revived due to its potential for energy-efficient and highly parallel computations. In this two-part paper, we explore analog computers that linearly process microwave signals, named microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs), and their applications in signal processing and communications. In Part I of this paper, we model a MiLAC as a multiport microwave network with tunable impedance components, enabling the execution of mathematical operations by reconfiguring the microwave network and applying input signals at its ports. We demonstrate that a MiLAC can efficiently compute the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator and matrix inversion, with remarkably low computational complexity. Specifically, a matrix can be inverted with complexity growing with the square of its size. We also show how a MiLAC can be used jointly with digital operations to implement sophisticated algorithms such as the Kalman filter. To enhance practicability, we propose a design of MiLAC based on lossless impedance components, reducing power consumption and eliminating the need for costly active components. In Part II of this paper, we investigate the applications of MiLACs in wireless communications, highlighting their potential to enable future wireless systems by executing computations and beamforming in the analog domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog-domain operations offer a promising solution to accelerating signal processing and enabling future multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications with thousands of antennas. In Part I of this paper, we have introduced a microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) as an analog computer that processes microwave signals linearly, demonstrating its potential to reduce the computational complexity of specific signal processing tasks. In Part II of this paper, we extend these benefits to wireless communications, showcasing how MiLAC enables gigantic MIMO beamforming entirely in the analog domain. MiLAC-aided beamforming enables the maximum flexibility and performance of digital beamforming, while significantly reducing hardware costs by minimizing the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and only relying on low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In addition, it eliminates per-symbol operations by completely avoiding digital-domain processing and remarkably reduces the computational complexity of zero-forcing (ZF), which scales quadratically with the number of antennas instead of cubically. It also processes signals with fixed matrices, e.g., the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), directly in the analog domain. Numerical results show that it can perform ZF and DFT with a computational complexity reduction of up to $1.5\times 10^4$ and $4.0\times 10^7$ times, respectively, compared to digital beamforming.</description>

      <title>MROP: Modulated Rank-One Projections for compressive radio interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging generation of radio-interferometric (RI) arrays are set to form images of the sky with a new regime of sensitivity and resolution. This implies a significant increase in visibility data volumes, which for single-frequency observations will scale as $\mathcal{O}(Q^2B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals (or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques. This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition, coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\times Q$ batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$ of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated for monochromatic intensity imaging both in simulation and from real data, with comparison to the classical and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation algorithm for image formation. Our results suggest that the data size necessary to preserve imaging quality using MROPs is reduced to the order of image size, well below the original and BDA data sizes.</description>

Abstract: The increasing need for robustness, reliability, and determinism in wireless networks for industrial and mission-critical applications is the driver for the growth of new innovative methods. The study presented in this work makes use of machine learning techniques to predict channel quality in a Wi-Fi network in terms of the frame delivery ratio. Predictions can be used proactively to adjust communication parameters at runtime and optimize network operations for industrial applications. Methods including convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory were analyzed on datasets acquired from a real Wi-Fi setup across multiple channels. The models were compared in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity. Results show that the frame delivery ratio can be reliably predicted, and convolutional neural networks, although slightly less effective than other models, are more efficient in terms of CPU usage and memory consumption. This enhances the model's usability on embedded and industrial systems.</description>
