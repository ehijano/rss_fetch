      <title>Science ouverte et collaborative pour l'\'elaboration d'un banc automatis\'e de caract\'erisation de pertes en commutation par opposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The switching losses of power transistors are generally measured using the so-called double pulse method. Measuring the opposition of two switching cells is a complementary method that is more accurate but indirect. However, implementing this method can be more complex and requires calibration steps and comprehensive control, with the added issue of thermal management. In this context, we proposed to address this topic through open and collaborative science, first in the form of a two-day hackathon, followed by monthly open sessions. More than 20 participants contributed to the two-day hackathon, followed by monthly sessions for those wishing to continue working together. This enabled us to set up an automated bench, in open science, including the generation of switching commands, the configuration and control of measuring instruments, and the hardware part. Here we present and share our work and this open approach.</description>

      <title>Dry ice baths as liquid nitrogen substitutes for physics demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid nitrogen (LN2) is a long-time favorite for physics demonstrations, with a large repertoire of crowd-pleasing experiments that are cornerstones in outreach efforts. While R1 universities usually have a ready LN2 supply for their Physics, Chemistry, and Biology departments, K-12 and two-year college teachers often have to go to specialty suppliers to obtain LN2, and also need access to expensive storage equipment. Dry ice (solid CO2) is available at many super markets, and as such its suitability as a substitute for LN2 was explored, with the results discussed below. At 77K (-196{\deg}C) LN2 is considerably colder than dry ice at 195K (-78.5{\deg}C), however some demonstrations are still viable.</description>

      <title>NotebookLM as a Socratic physics tutor: Design and preliminary observations of a RAG-based tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores NotebookLM, a Google Gemini - powered AI platform that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a Socratic tutor for physics education. In this implementation, NotebookLM was configured to support students in solving conceptually oriented physics problems through a guided, questioning-based dialogue. When deployed as a collaborative tutor, the system restricts student interaction to a chat-only interface, promoting controlled and guided engagement. By grounding its responses in teacher-provided source documents, the AI tutor helps mitigate one of the major shortcomings of standard Large Language Models - hallucinations - thereby ensuring more traceable and reliable answers. This work details the methodological design of the tutor, including the iterative development of a pedagogical "Training Manual", and presents preliminary qualitative observations from demonstrations with pre-service and in-service teachers. These observations highlight both the promising potential of the tool and key pedagogical challenges, such as managing user motivation. While limitations remain, this work offers a promising and replicable model for educators seeking to implement grounded AI tutors in their own teaching contexts.</description>

      <title>Updating the Complex Systems Keyword Diagram Using Collective Feedback and Latest Literature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complex systems keyword diagram generated by the author in 2010 has been used widely in a variety of educational and outreach purposes, but it definitely needs a major update and reorganization. This short paper reports our recent attempt to update the keyword diagram using information collected from the following multiple sources: (a) collective feedback posted on social media, (b) recent reference books on complex systems and network science, (c) online resources on complex systems, and (d) keyword search hits obtained using OpenAlex, an open-access bibliographic catalogue of scientific publications. The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's and other public communities' perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems. Four topical communities were obtained from the keyword association network, although they were highly intertwined with each other. We hope that the resulting network visualization of complex systems keywords provides a more up-to-date, accurate topic map of the field of complex systems as of today.</description>
