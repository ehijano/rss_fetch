      <title>A Sequent Calculus For Trace Formula Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specification languages are essential in deductive program verification, but they are usually based on first-order logic, hence less expressive than the programs they specify. Recently, trace specification logics with fixed points that are at least as expressive as their target programs were proposed. This makes it possible to specify not merely pre- and postconditions, but the whole trace of even recursive programs. Previous work established a sound and complete calculus to determine whether a program satisfies a given trace formula. However, the applicability of the calculus and prospects for mechanized verification rely on the ability to prove consequence between trace formulas. We present a sound sequent calculus for proving implication (i.e. trace inclusion) between trace formulas. To handle fixed point operations with an unknown recursive bound, fixed point induction rules are used. We also employ contracts and {\mu}-formula synchronization. While this does not yet result in a complete calculus for trace formula implication, it is possible to prove many non-trivial properties.</description>

      <title>BURNS: Backward Underapproximate Reachability for Neural-Feedback-Loop Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-enabled planning and control algorithms are increasingly popular, but they often lack rigorous guarantees of performance or safety. We introduce an algorithm for computing underapproximate backward reachable sets of nonlinear discrete time neural feedback loops. We then use the backward reachable sets to check goal-reaching properties. Our algorithm is based on overapproximating the system dynamics function to enable computation of underapproximate backward reachable sets through solutions of mixed-integer linear programs. We rigorously analyze the soundness of our algorithm and demonstrate it on a numerical example. Our work expands the class of properties that can be verified for learning-enabled systems.</description>

      <title>The Weihrauch degree of finding Nash equilibria in multiplayer games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is there an algorithm that takes a game in normal form as input, and outputs a Nash equilibrium? If the payoffs are integers, the answer is yes, and lot of work has been done in its computational complexity. If the payoffs are permitted to be real numbers, the answer is no, for continuity reasons. It is worthwhile to investigate the precise degree of non-computability (the Weihrauch degree), since knowing the degree entails what other approaches are available (eg, is there a randomized algorithm with positive success change?). The two player case has already been fully classified, but the multiplayer case remains open and is addressed here. Our approach involves classifying the degree of finding roots of polynomials, and lifting this to systems of polynomial inequalities via cylindrical algebraic decomposition.</description>

      <title>Existential and positive games: a comonadic and axiomatic view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number of model-comparison games central to (finite) model theory, such as pebble and Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} games, can be captured as comonads on categories of relational structures. In particular, the coalgebras for these comonads encode in a syntax-free way preservation of resource-indexed logic fragments, such as first-order logic with bounded quantifier rank or a finite number of variables.
  In this paper, we extend this approach to existential and positive fragments (i.e., without universal quantifiers and without negations, respectively) of first-order and modal logic. We show, both concretely and at the axiomatic level of arboreal categories, that the preservation of existential fragments is characterised by the existence of so-called pathwise embeddings, while positive fragments are captured by a newly introduced notion of positive bisimulation. As an application, we offer a new proof of an equi-resource Lyndon positivity theorem for (multi)modal logic.</description>

      <title>When is the partial map classifier a Sierpi\'nski cone?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationship between partial map classifiers, Sierpi\'nski cones, and axioms for synthetic higher categories and domains within univalent foundations. In particular, we show that synthetic $\infty$-categories are closed under partial map classifiers assuming Phoa's principle, and we isolate a new reflective subuniverse of types within which the Sierpi\'nski cone (a lax colimit) can be computed as a partial map classifier by strengthening the Segal condition.</description>

      <title>Degrees of incomputability, realizability and constructive reverse mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.10712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a way of assigning a realizability notion to each degree of incomputability. In our setting, we make use of Weihrauch degrees (degrees of incomputability/discontinuity of partial multi-valued functions) to obtain Lifschitz-like relative realizability predicates. In this note, we present sample examples on how to lift some separation results on Weihrauch degrees to those over intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ${\bf IZF}$.</description>

      <title>Lifting couplings in Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper makes mathematically precise the idea that conditional probabilities are analogous to path liftings in geometry.
  The idea of lifting is modelled in terms of the category-theoretic concept of a lens, which can be interpreted as a consistent choice of arrow liftings. The category we study is the one of probability measures over a given standard Borel space, with morphisms given by the couplings, or transport plans.
  The geometrical picture is even more apparent once we equip the arrows of the category with weights, which one can interpret as "lengths" or "costs", forming a so-called weighted category, which unifies several concepts of category theory and metric geometry.
  Indeed, we show that the weighted version of a lens is tightly connected to the notion of submetry in geometry.
  Every weighted category gives rise to a pseudo-quasimetric space via optimization over the arrows. In particular, Wasserstein spaces can be obtained from the weighted categories of probability measures and their couplings, with the weight of a coupling given by its cost.
  In this case, conditionals allow one to form weighted lenses, which one can interpret as "lifting transport plans, while preserving their cost".</description>

      <title>TTT: A Temporal Refinement Heuristic for Tenuously Tractable Discrete Time Reachability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reachable set computation is an important tool for analyzing control systems. Simulating a control system can show general trends, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide guarantees of correctness. Reachability analysis for complex control systems, e.g., with nonlinear dynamics and/or a neural network controller, is often either slow or overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, i.e., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. This paper introduces the idea of temporal refinement: automatically choosing when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches as an additional tool to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. We introduce a temporal refinement algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness at computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network controllers. We calculate reachable sets with varying computational budget and show that our algorithm can generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline in 20-70% less time.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of DAI: A Logic-Based Approach to Stablecoin Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to traditional currencies. Despite their growing prominence, many stablecoins have struggled to consistently meet stability expectations, and their underlying mechanisms often remain opaque and challenging to analyze. This paper focuses on the DAI stablecoin, which combines crypto-collateralization and algorithmic mechanisms. We propose a formal logic-based framework for representing the policies and operations of DAI, implemented in Prolog and released as open-source software. Our framework enables detailed analysis and simulation of DAI's stability mechanisms, providing a foundation for understanding its robustness and identifying potential vulnerabilities.</description>
