      <title>Generalized Distribution Prediction for Asset Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for predicting the distribution of asset returns using a quantile-based method with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our model is designed in two stages: the first focuses on predicting the quantiles of normalized asset returns using asset-specific features, while the second stage incorporates market data to adjust these predictions for broader economic conditions. This results in a generalized model that can be applied across various asset classes, including commodities, cryptocurrencies, as well as synthetic datasets. The predicted quantiles are then converted into full probability distributions through kernel density estimation, allowing for more precise return distribution predictions and inferencing. The LSTM model significantly outperforms a linear quantile regression baseline by 98% and a dense neural network model by over 50%, showcasing its ability to capture complex patterns in financial return distributions across both synthetic and real-world data. By using exclusively asset-class-neutral features, our model achieves robust, generalizable results.</description>

      <title>The VIX as Stochastic Volatility for Corporate Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classic stochastic volatility models assume volatility is unobservable. We use the VIX for consider it observable, and use the Volatility Index: S\&amp;P 500 VIX. This index was designed to measure volatility of S&amp;P 500. We apply it to a different segment: Corporate bond markets. We fit time series models for spreads between corporate and 10-year Treasury bonds. Next, we divide residuals by VIX. Our main idea is such division makes residuals closer to the ideal case of a Gaussian white noise. This is remarkable, since these residuals and VIX come from separate market segments. We conclude with the analysis of long-term behavior of these models.</description>
