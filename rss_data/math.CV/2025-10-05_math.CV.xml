      <title>Landau-type Theorems for Polyanalytic and Log-$\alpha$-analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article, we investigate the univalence property of polyanalytic functions and $\log$-$\alpha$-analytic functions. First, by using a new idea, we prove an improved lemma and the coefficient estimates for bounded polyanalytic functions on the unit disk. Then, we present three versions of Landau-type theorems for such functions and determine the univalence domain and the radius of schlicht disk. Finally, as a consequence, the Landau-type theorems for $\log$-$\alpha$-analytic functions are also provided.</description>

      <title>Notions of Higher Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Notions of finite type play an important role in several complex variables. The most standard notion is D'Angelo type, which measures the order of contact of holomorphic curves with the boundary of a domain in ${\mathbb C}^n$. For the $\bar \partial$-Neumann problem, however, the order of contact of the boundary of the domain with $q$-dimensional complex varieties controls its behavior on $(p,q)$ forms. There are two different ways of measuring this order of contact, one due to John D'Angelo and another due to David Catlin. We survey the known results about the D'Angelo and Catlin $q$-types, their relationship, and other notions that complete the picture.</description>

      <title>The shrinking target and recurrence problem for non-autonomous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shrinking target and recurrence set associated to non-autonomous measure-preserving systems on compact metric spaces, establishing zero-one criteria in the spirit of classical Borel-Cantelli results. Our first main theorem gives a quantitative shrinking target result for non-autonomous systems under a uniform mixing condition, providing asymptotics with an optimal error term. This general result is applicable to certain families of inner functions, yielding concrete applications such as digit patterns in multi-base expansions. Turning to recurrence, we establish new zero-measure laws for non-autonomous systems. In the autonomous case, we prove a zero-one criterion for recurrence sets of centred, one-component inner functions via Markov partitions and distortion estimates. Together, these results provide a unified framework for shrinking target and recurrence problems in both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently Rather et al. \cite{NT} considered the generalized derivative and the generalized polar derivative and studied the relative position of zeros of generalized derivative and generalized polar derivative with respect to the zeros of polynomial.\\ \indent In this paper, we establish some inequalities that estimate the maximum modulus of generalized derivative and the generalized polar derivative of the polynomial $P(z)$, which is also the extension of recently known results.</description>

      <title>Nodal resolution of quasiregular curves via bubble trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of Gromov's compactness theorem for quasiregular curves into calibrated manifolds with bounded geometry. In our main theorem, given an $n$-dimensional calibration $\omega$ on manifold $N$, we associate to a weak-$\star$ limit $\mu = \lim_{k \to \infty} \star F_k^*\omega$ of measures induced by a sequence $(F_k \colon X\to N)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of $K$-quasiregular $\omega$-curves on a nodal manifold $X$, a bubble tree $\widehat X$ over $X$, a sequence of mappings $(\widehat F_\ell \colon X \to N)_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}}$ converging locally uniformly to a quasiregular curve $\widehat F\colon \widehat X\to N$ which realizes the measure $\mu$, that is, $\mu = \pi_*(\star \widehat F^*\omega)$, where $\pi \colon \widehat X\to X$ is the natural projection. We call the sequence $(\widehat F_\ell)_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}}$ a nodal resolution of the sequence $(F_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$. As a corollary we obtain a normality criterion for families of quasiregular curves. Classic interpretations of bubbling via Gromov--Hausdorff convergence and pinching maps also follow.</description>

      <title>Two Calabi-Yau theorems for degenerations of compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss two closely related Calabi-Yau theorems for degenerations of compact K\"ahler manifolds. The first is a Calabi-Yau theorem for big test configurations, that generalizes a result in [WN24]. It follows from recent joint work with Mesquita-Piccione [MW25], but is here given a more direct proof. The second result is a Calabi-Yau theorem for a wider class of degenerations, formulated in the language of non-Archimedean K\"ahler geometry. It was first proved in the algebraic setting by Boucksom-Jonsson [BJ22], building on earlier work of Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson [BFJ15], while the general K\"ahler case was established in [MW25]. Our main focus here is on the connection between these results and the theory of big cohomology classes and their volumes.</description>

      <title>Piecewise geodesic Jordan curves II: Loewner energy, projective structures, and accessory parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere passing through $n \ge 3$ given points. We show that in each relative isotopy class of such curves, there exists a unique curve that minimizes the Loewner energy. These curves have the property that each arc between two consecutive points is a hyperbolic geodesic in the domain bounded by the other arcs. This geodesic property lets us define a complex projective structure whose holonomy lies in $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. We show that the quadratic differential comparing this projective structure to the trivial projective structure on the sphere has simple poles whose residues (accessory parameters) are given by the Wirtinger derivatives of the minimal Loewner energy. This is reminiscent of Polyakov's conjecture for Fuchsian projective structures, proven by Takhtajan and Zograf. Finally, we show that the projective structures we obtain are related to Fuchsian projective structures through $\pi$-grafting.</description>

      <title>On the coefficients estimate of K-quasiconformal harmonic mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the Wang et al. \cite{wwrq} proposed a coefficient conjecture for the family ${\mathcal S}_H^0(K)$ of $K$-quasiconformal harmonic mappings $f = h + \overline{g}$ that are sense-preserving and univalent, where $h(z)=z+\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}a_kz^k$ and $g(z)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}b_kz^k$ are analytic in the unit disk $|z|&lt;1$, and the dilatation $\omega =g'/h'$ satisfies the condition $|\omega(z)| \leq k&lt;1$ for $\ID$, with $K=\frac{1+k}{1-k}\geq 1$. The main aim of this article is provide an affirmative answer in support of this conjecture by proving this conjecture for every starlike function (resp. close-to-convex function) from $\mathcal{S}^0_H(K)$. In addition, we verify this conjecture also for typically real $K$-quasiconformal harmonic mappings. Also, we establish sharp coefficients estimate of convex $K$-quasiconformal harmonic mappings. By doing so, our work provides a document in support of the main conjecture of Wang et al..</description>

      <title>Parabolic dynamics according to Maurice Heins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper, based upon an unpublished manuscript by Maurice Heins, answers a question posed by Valiron about the dynamics of parabolic self-maps of the unit disk in the complex plane, considerably simplifying arguments previously used for answering the same question. The main new tool introduced is the notion of left straightening of a sequence of iterates, that can be effectively employed for studying the hyperbolic step of a parabolic map.</description>

      <title>Separatrix configurations in holomorphic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of boundary orbits (separatrices) of canonical regions in holomorphic flows with real-valued time. We establish the continuity of transit times along these boundary orbits and classify possible path components of the boundary of flow-invariant domains. Thus, we provide central tools for geometric constructions aimed at examining the role of blow-up scenarios in separatrix configurations of basins of simple equilibria and global elliptic sectors:
  First, we prove that the separatrices of basins of centers is entirely composed of double-sided separatrices with a blow-up in finite positive and finite negative time.
  Second, we show that the separatrices of node and focus basins (sinks and sources) exhibit a finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we propose a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in [The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows, K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions.
  Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices.</description>
