      <title>Posterior bounds on divergence time of two sequences under dependent-site evolutionary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let x and y be two length n DNA sequences, and suppose we would like to estimate the divergence time T. A well known simple but crude estimate of T is p := d(x,y)/n, the fraction of mutated sites (the p-distance). We establish a posterior concentration bound on T, showing that the posterior distribution of T concentrates within a logarithmic factor of p when d(x,y)log(n)/n = o(1). Our bounds hold under a large class of evolutionary models, including many standard models that incorporate site dependence. As a special case, we show that T exceeds p with vanishingly small posterior probability as n increases under models with constant mutation rates, complementing the result of Mihaescu and Steel (Appl Math Lett 23(9):975--979, 2010). Our approach is based on bounding sequence transition probabilities in various convergence regimes of the underlying evolutionary process. Our result may be useful for improving the efficiency of iterative optimization and sampling schemes for estimating divergence times in phylogenetic inference.</description>

      <title>Pre-exposure prophylaxis and syphilis in men who have sex with men: a network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been established as an effective tool for preventing HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). However, there is the possibility of PrEP usage leading to increased sexual partners and increased transmission of non-HIV sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis. We take here a network perspective to examine this possibility using data on sexual partnerships, demographic data, PrEP usage, and syphilis among MSM in Columbus, Ohio. We use a recently developed community detection algorithm, an adaptation of the community detection algorithm InfoMap to absorbing random walks, to identify clusters of people (`communities') that may drive syphilis transmission. Our community detection approach takes into account both sexual partnerships as well as syphilis treatment rates when detecting communities. We apply this algorithm to sexual networks fitted to empirical data from the Network Epidemiology of Syphilis Transmission (NEST) study in Columbus, Ohio. We assume that PrEP usage is associated with regular visits to a sexual health provider, and thus is correlated with syphilis detection and treatment rates. We examine how PrEP usage can affect community structure in the sexual networks fitted to the NEST data. We identify two types of PrEP users, those belonging to a large, highly connected community and tending to have a large number of sexual partners, versus those with a small number of sexual partners and belonging to smaller communities. A stochastic syphilis model indicates that PrEP users in the large community may play an important role in sustaining syphilis transmission.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics under random switching</title>

Abstract: Populations interact non-linearly and are influenced by environmental fluctuations. In order to have realistic mathematical models, one needs to take into account that the environmental fluctuations are inherently stochastic. Often, environmental stochasticity is modeled by systems of stochastic differential equations. However, this type of stochasticity is not always the best suited for ecological modeling. Instead, biological systems can be modeled using piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP). For a PDMP the process follows the flow of a system of ordinary differential equations for a random time, after which the environment switches to a different state, where the dynamics is given by a different system of differential equations. Then this is repeated. The current paper is devoted to the study of the dynamics of $n$ populations described by $n$-dimensional Kolmogorov PDMP. We provide sharp conditions for persistence and extinction, based on the invasion rates (Lyapunov exponents) of the ergodic probability measures supported on the boundary of the positive orthant. In order to showcase the applicability of our results, we apply the theory in some interesting ecological examples.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models of Evolution: SNP-level Population Adaptation by Genomic Linkage Incorporation</title>

Abstract: The investigation of allele frequency trajectories in populations evolving under controlled environmental pressures has become a popular approach to study evolutionary processes on the molecular level. Statistical models based on well-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses about empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical models like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as the independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the parameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known for the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to their high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not been widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the challenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&amp;R) based on pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural network that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical observations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele frequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on simulated E&amp;R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the distribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the representational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned representations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible in Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data high degree of LD when compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mobility in Spatial Biodiversity Models through Recurrence Quantification Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrence plots and their associated quantifiers provide a robust framework for detecting and characterising complex patterns in non-linear time-series. In this paper, we employ recurrence quantification analysis to investigate the dynamics of the cyclic, non-hierarchical May-Leonard model, also referred to as rock--paper--scissors systems, that describes competitive interactions among three species. A crucial control parameter in these systems is the species' mobility $m$, which governs the spatial displacement of individuals and profoundly influences the resulting dynamics. By systematically varying $m$ and constructing suitable recurrence plots from numerical simulations, we explore how recurrence quantifiers reflect distinct dynamical features associated with different ecological states. We then introduce an ensemble-based approach that leverages statistical distributions of recurrence quantifiers, computed from numerous independent realisations, allowing us to identify dynamical outliers as significant deviations from typical system behaviour. Through detailed numerical analyses, we demonstrate that these outliers correspond to divergent ecological regimes associated with specific mobility values, providing also a robust manner to infer the mobility parameter from observed numerical data. Our results highlight the potential of recurrence-based methods as diagnostic tools for analysing spatial ecological systems and extracting ecologically relevant information from their non-linear dynamical patterns.</description>
