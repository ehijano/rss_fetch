      <title>MSM-BD: Multimodal Social Media Bot Detection Using Heterogeneous Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although social bots can be engineered for constructive applications, their potential for misuse in manipulative schemes and malware distribution cannot be overlooked. This dichotomy underscores the critical need to detect social bots on social media platforms. Advances in artificial intelligence have improved the abilities of social bots, allowing them to generate content that is almost indistinguishable from human-created content. These advancements require the development of more advanced detection techniques to accurately identify these automated entities. Given the heterogeneous information landscape on social media, spanning images, texts, and user statistical features, we propose MSM-BD, a Multimodal Social Media Bot Detection approach using heterogeneous information. MSM-BD incorporates specialized encoders for heterogeneous information and introduces a cross-modal fusion technology, Cross-Modal Residual Cross-Attention (CMRCA), to enhance detection accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments using the TwiBot-22 dataset.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neural Adaptive Wireless Video Streaming via Lower-Layer Information Exposure and Online Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) demonstrates its promising potential in the realm of adaptive video streaming and has recently received increasing attention. However, existing DRL-based methods for adaptive video streaming use only application (APP) layer information, adopt heuristic training methods, and train generalized neural networks with pre-collected data. This paper aims to boost the quality of experience (QoE) of adaptive wireless video streaming by using lower-layer information, deriving a rigorous training method, and adopting online tuning with real-time data. First, we formulate a more comprehensive and accurate adaptive wireless video streaming problem as an infinite stage discounted Markov decision process (MDP) problem by additionally incorporating past and lower-layer information, allowing a flexible tradeoff between QoE and costs for obtaining system information and solving the problem. In the offline scenario (only with pre-collected data), we propose an enhanced asynchronous advantage actor-critic (eA3C) method by jointly optimizing the parameters of parameterized policy and value function. Specifically, we build an eA3C network consisting of a policy network and a value network that can utilize cross-layer, past, and current information and jointly train the eA3C network using pre-collected samples. In the online scenario (with additional real-time data), we propose two continual learning-based online tuning methods for designing better policies for a specific user with different QoE and training time tradeoffs. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed offline policy can improve the QoE by 6.8~14.4% compared to the state-of-arts in the offline scenario, and the proposed online policies can further achieve 6~28% gains in QoE over the proposed offline policy in the online scenario.</description>

      <title>DiffCL: A Diffusion-Based Contrastive Learning Framework with Semantic Alignment for Multimodal Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems integrate diverse multimodal information into the feature representations of both items and users, thereby enabling a more comprehensive modeling of user preferences. However, existing methods are hindered by data sparsity and the inherent noise within multimodal data, which impedes the accurate capture of users' interest preferences. Additionally, discrepancies in the semantic representations of items across different modalities can adversely impact the prediction accuracy of recommendation models. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion-based contrastive learning framework (DiffCL) for multimodal recommendation. DiffCL employs a diffusion model to generate contrastive views that effectively mitigate the impact of noise during the contrastive learning phase. Furthermore, it improves semantic consistency across modalities by aligning distinct visual and textual semantic information through stable ID embeddings. Finally, the introduction of the Item-Item Graph enhances multimodal feature representations, thereby alleviating the adverse effects of data sparsity on the overall system performance. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the DiffCL.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Cover Version Identification Models: A Study Using Cover Versions from YouTube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in cover song identification have shown great success. However, models are usually tested on a fixed set of datasets which are relying on the online cover song database SecondHandSongs. It is unclear how well models perform on cover songs on online video platforms, which might exhibit alterations that are not expected. In this paper, we annotate a subset of songs from YouTube sampled by a multi-modal uncertainty sampling approach and evaluate state-of-the-art models. We find that existing models achieve significantly lower ranking performance on our dataset compared to a community dataset. We additionally measure the performance of different types of versions (e.g., instrumental versions) and find several types that are particularly hard to rank. Lastly, we provide a taxonomy of alterations in cover versions on the web.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Text-to-Image Diffusion Prior for Zero-Shot Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, zero-shot image captioning has gained increasing attention, where only text data is available for training. The remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion model presents the potential to resolve this task by employing synthetic image-caption pairs generated by this pre-trained prior. Nonetheless, the defective details in the salient regions of the synthetic images introduce semantic misalignment between the synthetic image and text, leading to compromised results. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Patch-wise Cross-modal feature Mix-up (PCM) mechanism to adaptively mitigate the unfaithful contents in a fine-grained manner during training, which can be integrated into most of encoder-decoder frameworks, introducing our PCM-Net. Specifically, for each input image, salient visual concepts in the image are first detected considering the image-text similarity in CLIP space. Next, the patch-wise visual features of the input image are selectively fused with the textual features of the salient visual concepts, leading to a mixed-up feature map with less defective content. Finally, a visual-semantic encoder is exploited to refine the derived feature map, which is further incorporated into the sentence decoder for caption generation. Additionally, to facilitate the model training with synthetic data, a novel CLIP-weighted cross-entropy loss is devised to prioritize the high-quality image-text pairs over the low-quality counterparts. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PCM-Net compared with state-of-the-art VLMs-based approaches. It is noteworthy that our PCM-Net ranks first in both in-domain and cross-domain zero-shot image captioning. The synthetic dataset SynthImgCap and code are available at https://jianjieluo.github.io/SynthImgCap.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Based Multi-Agent System Augmented Complex Event Processing Pipeline for Internet of Multimedia Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Large Language Model (LLM), also known as foundation models, based multi-agent system framework for complex event processing (CEP) with a focus on video query processing use cases. The primary goal is to create a proof-of-concept (POC) that integrates state-of-the-art LLM orchestration frameworks with publish/subscribe (pub/sub) tools to address the integration of LLMs with current CEP systems. Utilizing the Autogen framework in conjunction with Kafka message brokers, the system demonstrates an autonomous CEP pipeline capable of handling complex workflows. Extensive experiments evaluate the system's performance across varying configurations, complexities, and video resolutions, revealing the trade-offs between functionality and latency. The results show that while higher agent count and video complexities increase latency, the system maintains high consistency in narrative coherence. This research builds upon and contributes to, existing novel approaches to distributed AI systems, offering detailed insights into integrating such systems into existing infrastructures.</description>

      <title>MMVA: Multimodal Matching Based on Valence and Arousal across Images, Music, and Musical Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Multimodal Matching based on Valence and Arousal (MMVA), a tri-modal encoder framework designed to capture emotional content across images, music, and musical captions. To support this framework, we expand the Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet) dataset, creating IMEMNet-C which includes 24,756 images and 25,944 music clips with corresponding musical captions. We employ multimodal matching scores based on the continuous valence (emotional positivity) and arousal (emotional intensity) values. This continuous matching score allows for random sampling of image-music pairs during training by computing similarity scores from the valence-arousal values across different modalities. Consequently, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in valence-arousal prediction tasks. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates its efficacy in various zeroshot tasks, highlighting the potential of valence and arousal predictions in downstream applications.</description>

      <title>HarmonyIQA: Pioneering Benchmark and Model for Image Harmonization Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image composition involves extracting a foreground object from one image and pasting it into another image through Image harmonization algorithms (IHAs), which aim to adjust the appearance of the foreground object to better match the background. Existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods may fail to align with human visual preference on image harmonization due to the insensitivity to minor color or light inconsistency. To address the issue and facilitate the advancement of IHAs, we introduce the first Image Quality Assessment Database for image Harmony evaluation (HarmonyIQAD), which consists of 1,350 harmonized images generated by 9 different IHAs, and the corresponding human visual preference scores. Based on this database, we propose a Harmony Image Quality Assessment (HarmonyIQA), to predict human visual preference for harmonized images. Extensive experiments show that HarmonyIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on human visual preference evaluation for harmonized images, and also achieves competing results on traditional IQA tasks. Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluation also shows that HarmonyIQA exhibits better generalization ability than self-supervised learning-based IQA methods. Both HarmonyIQAD and HarmonyIQA will be made publicly available upon paper publication.</description>

      <title>Towards Expressive Video Dubbing with Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) generates speech aligned with lip motion and facial emotion from scripts. Recent research focuses on modeling multimodal context to enhance prosody expressiveness but overlooks two key issues: 1) Multiscale prosody expression attributes in the context influence the current sentence's prosody. 2) Prosody cues in context interact with the current sentence, impacting the final prosody expressiveness. To tackle these challenges, we propose M2CI-Dubber, a Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction scheme for AVD. This scheme includes two shared M2CI encoders to model the multiscale multimodal context and facilitate its deep interaction with the current sentence. By extracting global and local features for each modality in the context, utilizing attention-based mechanisms for aggregation and interaction, and employing an interaction-based graph attention network for fusion, the proposed approach enhances the prosody expressiveness of synthesized speech for the current sentence. Experiments on the Chem dataset show our model outperforms baselines in dubbing expressiveness. The code and demos are available at \textcolor[rgb]{0.93,0.0,0.47}{https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/M2CI-Dubber}.</description>

      <title>Sound-VECaps: Improving Audio Generation with Visual Enhanced Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have shown significant achievements in audio generation tasks. However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts, leading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem stems from the simplicity and scarcity of the training data. This work aims to create a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio generation models. We first develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed captions by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging labels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). The resulting dataset, Sound-VECaps, comprises 1.66M high-quality audio-caption pairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and environment information. We then demonstrate that training the text-to-audio generation models with Sound-VECaps significantly improves the performance on complex prompts. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of the models on several downstream audio-language tasks, showing the potential of Sound-VECaps in advancing audio-text representation learning. Our dataset and models are available online from here https://yyua8222.github.io/Sound-VECaps-demo/.</description>

      <title>ChemDFM-X: Towards Large Multimodal Model for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid developments of AI tools are expected to offer unprecedented assistance to the research of natural science including chemistry. However, neither existing unimodal task-specific specialist models nor emerging general large multimodal models (LMM) can cover the wide range of chemical data modality and task categories. To address the real demands of chemists, a cross-modal Chemical General Intelligence (CGI) system, which serves as a truly practical and useful research assistant utilizing the great potential of LMMs, is in great need. In this work, we introduce the first Cross-modal Dialogue Foundation Model for Chemistry (ChemDFM-X). Diverse multimodal data are generated from an initial modality by approximate calculations and task-specific model predictions. This strategy creates sufficient chemical training corpora, while significantly reducing excessive expense, resulting in an instruction-tuning dataset containing 7.6M data. After instruction finetuning, ChemDFM-X is evaluated on extensive experiments of different chemical tasks with various data modalities. The results demonstrate the capacity of ChemDFM-X for multimodal and inter-modal knowledge comprehension. ChemDFM-X marks a significant milestone toward aligning all modalities in chemistry, a step closer to CGI.</description>

      <title>Stable-V2A: Synthesis of Synchronized Sound Effects with Temporal and Semantic Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound designers and Foley artists usually sonorize a scene, such as from a movie or video game, by manually annotating and sonorizing each action of interest in the video. In our case, the intent is to leave full creative control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative aspects of sound production. We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically and temporally aligned with the target video. Temporal alignment is guaranteed by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process. We train and test our model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models. In addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated characters walking in different locations. Samples and code available on our demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/Stable-V2A.</description>
