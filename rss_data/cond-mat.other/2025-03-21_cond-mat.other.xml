      <title>A quantum monomer-dimer model on Penrose tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of torques from orbital Rashba textures: the case of Co/Al interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of orbitronics, the rising of the orbital angular momentum generated at light metal interfaces from orbital textures via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects nowadays represent extraordinary alternatives to the usual heavy-metal spin-based materials. In the light of very recent experimental results [\textcolor{blue}{S. Krishnia \textit{et al.}, Nanoletters 2023, 23, 6785}], starting from state-of-the-art density functional theory simulations, we provide theoretical insights into the emergence of very strong orbital torques at the Co/Al interface location a strong orbital Rashba texture. By using linear response theory, we calculate the exerted orbital torque amplitudes, mainly of field-like intraband character, acting onto the ultrathin Co. Moreover, we show that an insertion of a single atomic plane of Pt between Co and Al is enough to suppress the effect which questions about the anatomy of the torque action clearly behaving differently than in the standard way. This work opens new routes to the engineering of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior and multistability in quasi-two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, despite being an idealization of real flows, is of fundamental interest as a model of the spontaneous emergence of order from chaotic flows. The emergence of order often displays critical behavior, whose study is hindered by the long spatial and temporal scales involved. Here, we experimentally study turbulence in periodically driven nanofluidic channels with a high aspect ratio using superfluid helium. We find a multistable transition behavior resulting from cascading bifurcations of large-scale vorticity and critical behavior at the transition to quasi-2D turbulence consistent with phase transitions in periodically driven many-body systems. We demonstrate that quasi-2D turbulent systems can undergo an abrupt change in response to a small change in a control parameter, consistent with predictions for large-scale atmospheric or oceanic flows.</description>
