      <title>Symmetry breaking fluctuations split the porphyrin Q bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porphyrins offer a malleable and cost-efficient platform to sculpt bioinspired technologies with tunable charge transfer, energy conversion, and photocatalytic properties. Yet, despite decades of research, the physical mechanisms that determine their electronic spectra remain elusive. Even for metal-free porphyrins, no consensus exists on the origin of the splitting of their $Q$-bands, an energetic region critical in photosynthesis. We leverage our recent statistical treatment of molecular motions in the condensed phase to predict their linear absorption spectra. By bridging exact quantum-dynamical expressions with atomistic simulations, our theory is the first to capture the spectra of representative porphyrins in solution: porphine, tetraphenylporphyrin, and tetraphenylporpholactone. Our work reveals that $Q$-band splitting arises from extreme timescale separation of nuclear motions that turn symmetry-forbidden transitions bright. We exploit these insights to propose and confirm how chemical modifications tune the optical properties of porphyrins, demonstrating the potential for developing design principles to tailor their optoelectronic behavior.</description>

      <title>Transcorrelated Methods Applied to Second Row Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the applicability of the transcorrelated method to the elements in the second row of the periodic table. We use transcorrelated Hamiltonians in conjunction with full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo and coupled cluster techniques to obtain total energies and ionisation potentials, investigating their dependence on the nature and size of the basis sets used. Transcorrelation accelerates convergence to the complete basis set limit relative to conventional approaches, and chemically accurate results can generally be obtained with the cc-pVTZ basis, even with a frozen Ne core in the post-Hartree--Fock treatment.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up approach to scalable growth of molecules capable of optical cycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-phase molecules capable of repeatable, narrow-band spontaneous photon scattering are prized for direct laser cooling and quantum state detection. Recently, large molecules incorporating phenyl rings have been shown to exhibit similar vibrational closure to the small molecules demonstrated so far, and it is not yet known if the high vibrational-mode density of even larger species will eventually compromise optical cycling. Here, we systematically increase the size of hydrocarbon ligands attached to single alkaline-earth-phenoxides from (-H) to -C$_{14}$H$_{19}$ while measuring the vibrational branching fractions of the optical transition. We find that varying the ligand size from 1 to more than 30 atoms does not systematically reduce the cycle closure, which remains around 90%. Theoretical extensions to larger diamondoids and bulk diamond surface suggest that alkaline earth phenoxides may maintain the desirable scattering behavior as the system size grows further, with no indication of an upper limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials and pharmaceutical development, rapidly and accurately determining the similarity between X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) measurements is crucial for efficient solid form screening and analysis. We present SMolNet, a classifier based on a Siamese network architecture, designed to automate the comparison of XRPD patterns. Our results show that training SMolNet on loss functions from the self-supervised learning domain yields a substantial boost in performance with respect to class separability and precision, specifically when classifying phases of previously unseen compounds. The application of SMolNet demonstrates significant improvements in screening efficiency across multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients, providing a powerful tool for scientists to discover and categorize measurements with reliable accuracy.</description>

      <title>KinetiX: A performance portable code generator for chemical kinetics and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present KinetiX, a software toolkit to generate computationally efficient fuel-specific routines for the chemical source term, thermodynamic and mixture-averaged transport properties for use in combustion simulation codes. The C++ routines are designed for high-performance execution on both CPU and GPU architectures. On CPUs, chemical kinetics computations are optimized by eliminating redundant operations and using data alignment and loops with trivial access patterns that enable auto-vectorization, reducing the latency of complex mathematical operations. On GPUs, performance is improved by loop unrolling, reducing the number of costly exponential evaluations and limiting the number of live variables for better register usage. The accuracy of the generated routines is checked against reference values computed using Cantera and the maximum relative errors are below $10^{-5}\%$. We evaluate the performance of the kernels on some of the latest CPU and GPU architectures from AMD and NVIDIA, i.e., AMD EPYC 9653, AMD MI250X, and NVIDIA H100. The routines generated by KinetiX outperform the general-purpose Cantera library, achieving speedups of up to 2.4x for species production rates and 3.2x for mixture-averaged transport properties on CPUs. Compared to the routines generated by PelePhysics (CEPTR), KinetiX achieves speedups of up to 2.6x on CPUs and 1.7x on GPUs for the species production rates kernel on a single-threaded basis.</description>

      <title>Chemifriction and Superlubricity: Friends or Foes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms underlying chemifriction, i.e. the contribution of interfacial bonding to friction in defected twisted graphene interfaces are revealed using fully atomistic machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations. This involves stochastic events of consecutive bond formation and rupture, that are spatially separated but not necessarily independent. A unique shear-induced interlayer atomic transfer healing mechanism is discovered that can be harnessed to design a run-in procedure to restore superlubric sliding. This mechanism should be manifested as negative differential friction coefficients that are expected to emerge under moderate normal loads. A physically motivated phenomenological model is developed to predict the effects of chemifriction in experimentally relevant sliding velocity regimes. This allows us to identify a distinct transition between logarithmic increase and logarithmic decrease of frictional stress with increasing sliding velocity. While demonstrated for homogeneous graphene interfaces, a similar mechanism is expected to occur in other homogeneous or heterogeneous defected two-dimensional material interfaces.</description>

      <title>The Rotational and Spin-Rotational Level Structure of para-H$_{2}^+$ from High-Resolution MQDT-Assisted Rydberg-State Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of the low-lying rotational levels of the X$^+$ $ ^2 \Sigma_g ^+$ ($v^+=0$) vibronic ground state of para-H$_2^+$ has been determined by combining frequency-comb calibrated continuous-wave high-resolution laser spectroscopy of $n$f Rydberg series in the range of principal quantum number $n$ between 28 and 115 and Rydberg-series extrapolation using multichannel-quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The use of accurate quantum-defect parameters obtained from new ab initio calculations enabled the experimental determination of the pure rotational term values of the $N^+= 2$, 4 and 6 rotational levels of H$_2^+$ with sub-MHz accuracy (174.236\,744\,6(77), 575.455\,632\,5(86) and 1191.385\,571(240) cm$^{-1}$, respectively), and of the corresponding spin-rotational coupling constants with an accuracy of better than 100 kHz (42.21(4), 41.26(8) and 40.04(8) MHz, respectively). These values are in agreement with the results of first-principles calculations that include high-order relativistic and quantum-electrodynamics corrections to the level energies. To reach the reported accuracy in the Rydberg series extrapolation, it was necessary to correct for artificial level shifts arising in the MQDT calculations in the vicinity of local perturbations of high-$n$ Rydberg states with a $v^+=0$ H$_2^+$ ion core caused by low-$n$ core-excited Rydberg states, and resulting from approximations in the treatment of the Rydberg-electron energy in the interacting channels.</description>

      <title>Molecular Origins of Exciton Condensation in Van der Waals Heterostructure Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have realized exciton condensation in bilayer materials such as graphene double layers and the van der Waals heterostructure MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ with the potential for nearly frictionless energy transport. Here we computationally observe the microscopic beginnings of exciton condensation in a molecular-scale fragment of MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$, using advanced electronic structure methods based on reduced density matrices. We establish a connection between the signature of exciton condensation -- the presence of a large eigenvalue in the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- and experimental evidence of exciton condensation in the material. The presence of a "critical seed" of exciton condensation in a molecular-scale fragment of a heterostructure bilayer provides insight into how local short-range strongly correlated effects may give rise to macroscopic exciton condensation. We find that molecular-scale properties such as layer alignment and interlayer distance can impact the formation of nonclassical long-range order in heterostructure bilayers, demonstrating the importance of geometric considerations for the rational design of exciton condensate material. Mechanistic insights into the microscopic origins of exciton condensation have potential implications for the design and development of new materials with enhanced energy transport properties.</description>

      <title>Surface hopping molecular dynamics simulation of ultrafast methyl iodide photodissociation mapped by Coulomb explosion imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a highly efficient method to directly simulate the photodissociation followed by Coulomb explosion of methyl iodide. In order to achieve statistical reliability, more than 40,000 trajectories are calculated on accurate potential energy surfaces of both the neutral molecule and the doubly charged cation. Non-adiabatic effects during photodissociation are treated using a Landau-Zener surface hopping algorithm. The simulation is performed analogous to a recent pump-probe experiment using coincident ion momentum imaging [Ziaee \textit{et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.} 2023, \textbf{25}, 9999]. At large pump-probe delays, the simulated delay-dependent kinetic energy release signals show overall good agreement with the experiment, with two major dissociation channels leading to $\text{I}(^2\text{P}_{3/2})$ and $\text{I}^*(^2\text{P}_{1/2})$ products. At short pump-probe delays, the simulated kinetic energy release shows a clear bifurcation near 12 fs, owing to non-adiabatic transitions through a conical intersection. The developed method is particularly suitable and efficient in simulating processes that highly rely on statistics or for identifying rare reaction channels.</description>

      <title>Coalescence induced late departure of bubbles improves water electrolysis efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In water electrolysis, bubbles form on the electrode and interact through processes such as collision and coalescence. However, the impact of bubble coalescence a fundamental process governing electrolytic bubble behaviour-on electrolysis efficiency remains unclear. Here, we show that enhancing bubble coalescence improves electrolysis efficiency by more than 30% compared to systems where coalescence is inhibited. One key feature is the continuous coalescence of a newly detached bubble with microbubbles on the electrode, which delays the former from departing. Experimental observations and numerical simulations reveal two key benefits of bubble coalescence for electrolysis efficiency: (1) it liberates surface bubbles from the electrode at much smaller sizes, reducing their diameter from approximately 60-80 um to less than 10 um, thus freeing the active sites of the electrode from bubble coverage; (2) it induces strong agitation, with velocities reaching 1m/s in a small region near the electrode (at a depth of 10-5 m), thereby significantly improving the heat/mass transfer locally. Importantly, the chaotic agitation effect lasts for approximately 10 ms, two orders of magnitude longer than the coalescence process, which occurs in around 0.2 ms. This work provides valuable insight into bubble management in water electrolysis and other gas-evolution electrochemical reactions.</description>

      <title>The role of electronic excited states in the spin-lattice relaxation of spin-1/2 molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance is a prime method for the study of chemical and biological structures and their dynamical processes. The interpretation of these experiments relies on considering the spin of electrons as the sole relevant degree of freedom. By applying ab inito open quantum systems theory to the full electronic wavefunction, here we show that contrary to this widespread framework the thermalization of the unpaired electron spin of two Cr(V) coordination compounds is driven by virtual transitions to excited states with energy higher than 20,000 cm$^{-1}$ instead of solely involving low-energy spin interactions such as Zeeman and hyperfine ones. Moreover, we found that a window of low-energy THz phonons contributes to thermalization, rather than a small number of high-energy vibrations. This work provides a drastic reinterpretation of relaxation in spin-1/2 systems and its chemical control strategies, and ultimately exemplifies the urgency of further advancing an ab initio approach to relaxometry.</description>

      <title>A New Angle on Benchmarking Noncovalent Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For noncovalent interactions (NCIs), the CCSD(T) coupled cluster method is widely regarded as the `gold standard'. With localized orbital approximations, benchmarks for ever larger NCI complexes are being published; yet tantalizing evidence from quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results appears to indicate that as the system size grows, CCSD(T) overbinds NCIs by progressively larger amounts, particularly when $\pi$-stacking is involved. Alas, post-CCSD(T) methods like CCSDT(Q) are cost-prohibitive, which requires us to consider alternative means of estimating post-CCSD(T) contributions. In this work, we take a step back by considering the evolution of the correlation energy with respect to the number of subunits for such $\pi$-stacked sequences as acene dimers and alkadiene dimers. We show it to be almost perfectly linear, and propose the slope of the line as a probe for the behavior of a given electron correlation method. By comparison with rank-reduced CCSDT(Q) results for benzene and naphthalene dimers, we show that while CCSD(T) does slightly overbind, it does not at the level suggested by the QMC results.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Temperature-Dependent CMC of Surfactant Mixtures with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surfactants are key ingredients in foaming and cleansing products across various industries such as personal and home care, industrial cleaning, and more, with the critical micelle concentration (CMC) being of major interest. Predictive models for CMC of pure surfactants have been developed based on recent ML methods, however, in practice surfactant mixtures are typically used due to to performance, environmental, and cost reasons. This requires accounting for synergistic/antagonistic interactions between surfactants; however, predictive ML models for a wide spectrum of mixtures are missing so far. Herein, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) framework for surfactant mixtures to predict the temperature-dependent CMC. We collect data for 108 surfactant binary mixtures, to which we add data for pure species from our previous work [Brozos et al. (2024), J. Chem. Theory Comput.]. We then develop and train GNNs and evaluate their accuracy across different prediction test scenarios for binary mixtures relevant to practical applications. The final GNN models demonstrate very high predictive performance when interpolating between different mixture compositions and for new binary mixtures with known species. Extrapolation to binary surfactant mixtures where either one or both surfactant species are not seen before, yields accurate results for the majority of surfactant systems. We further find superior accuracy of the GNN over a semi-empirical model based on activity coefficients, which has been widely used to date. We then explore if GNN models trained solely on binary mixture and pure species data can also accurately predict the CMCs of ternary mixtures. Finally, we experimentally measure the CMC of 4 commercial surfactants that contain up to four species and industrial relevant mixtures and find a very good agreement between measured and predicted CMC values.</description>

      <title>Basis set generation and optimization in the NISQ era with Quiqbox.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, ab initio computation of the electronic structure problems has become one of the major benchmarks for identifying the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Basis sets play a key role in the electronic structure methods implemented on both classical and quantum devices. To investigate the consequences of the single-particle basis sets, we propose a framework for more customizable basis set generation and optimization. This framework allows composite basis sets to go beyond typical basis set frameworks, such as atomic basis sets, by introducing the concept of mixed-contracted Gaussian-type orbitals. These basis set generations set the stage for more flexible variational optimization of basis set parameters. To realize this framework, we have developed an open-source software package named ``Quiqbox'' in the Julia programming language. We demonstrate various examples of using Quiqbox for basis set optimization and generation, ranging from optimizing atomic basis sets on the Hartree--Fock level, preparing the initial state for VQE computation, and constructing basis sets with completely delocalized orbitals. We also include various benchmarks of Quiqbox for basis set optimization and ab initial electronic structure computation.</description>

      <title>Solution of the v-representability problem on a one-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a solution to the v-representability problem for a non-relativistic quantum many-particle system on a ring domain in terms of Sobolev spaces and their duals. Any one-particle density that is square-integrable, has a square-integrable weak derivative, and is gapped away from zero can be realized from the solution of a many-particle Schr\"odinger equation, with or without interactions, by choosing a corresponding external potential. This potential can contain a distributional contribution but still gives rise to a self-adjoint Hamiltonian. Importantly, this allows for a well-defined Kohn-Sham procedure but, on the other hand, invalidates the usual proof of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of twist-dependent electron transfer rate in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular simulation and continuum dielectric theory, we consider how electrochemical kinetics are modulated by twist angle in bilayer graphene electrodes. By establishing a connection between twist angle and the screening length of charge carriers within the electrode, we investigate how tunable metallicity modifies the statistics of the electron transfer energy gap. Constant potential molecular simulations show that the activation free energy for electron transfer increases with screening length, leading to a non-monotonic dependence on the twist angle. The twist angle alters the density of states, tuning the number of thermally-accessible channels for electron transfer and the reorganization energy by affecting the stability of the vertically excited state through attenuated image charge interactions. Understanding these effects allows us to express the Marcus rate of interfacial electron transfer as a function of twist angle, consistent with a growing body of experimental observations.</description>
