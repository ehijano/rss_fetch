      <title>High-throughput measurement of elastic moduli of microfibers by rope coiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many fields where it is of interest to measure the elastic moduli of tiny fragile fibers, such as filamentous bacteria, actin filaments, DNA, carbon nanotubes, and functional microfibers. The elastic modulus is typically deduced from a sophisticated tensile test under a microscope, but the throughput is low and limited by the time-consuming and skill-intensive sample loading/unloading. Here, we demonstrate a simple microfluidic method enabling the high-throughput measurement of the elastic moduli of microfibers by rope coiling using a localized compression, where sample loading/unloading are not needed between consecutive measurements. The rope coiling phenomenon occurs spontaneously when a microfiber flows from a small channel into a wide channel. The elastic modulus is determined by measuring either the buckling length or the coiling radius. The throughput of this method, currently 3,300 fibers per hour, is a thousand times higher than that of a tensile tester. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by testing a nonuniform fiber with axially varying elastic modulus. We also demonstrate its capability for in situ inline measurement in a microfluidic production line. We envisage that high-throughput measurements may facilitate potential applications such as screening or sorting by mechanical properties and real-time control during production of microfibers.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of the thin film equation using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamics of thin films is typically described using phenomenological models whose connection to the microscopic particle dynamics is a subject of ongoing research. Existing methods based on density functional theory provide a good description of static thin films, but are not sufficient for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic derivation of the thin film equation using the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism. This method allows to directly obtain the correct gradient dynamics structure along with microscopic expressions for the mobility and the free energy. Our results are verified against molecular dynamics simulations for both simple fluids and polymers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the efficiency of principal signal transmission modes in proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the microscopic level, biological signal transmission relies on coordinated structural changes in allosteric proteins that involve sensor and effector modules. The timescales and microscopic details of signal transmission in proteins are often unclear, despite a plethora of structural information on signaling proteins. Based on linear-response theory, we develop a theoretical framework to define frequency-dependent force and displacement transmit functions through proteins and, more generally, viscoelastic media. Transmit functions quantify the fraction of a local time-dependent perturbation at one site, be it a deformation, a force, or a combination thereof, that survives at a second site. They are defined in terms of equilibrium fluctuations from simulations or experimental observations. We apply the framework to our all-atom molecular dynamics simulation data of a parallel, homodimeric coiled-coil (CC) motif that connects sensor and effector modules of a blue-light-regulated histidine kinase from bacterial signaling systems extensively studied in experiments. Our analysis reveals that signal transmission through the CC is possible via shift, splay, and twist deformation modes. Based on the results of mutation experiments, we infer that the most relevant mode for the biological function of the histidine kinase protein is the splay deformation.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies in dynamic yield stress measurements of cement pastes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic yield stress associated with the flow cessation of cement pastes is measured using a rheometer equipped with various shear geometries such as vane, helical, sandblasted co-axial cylinders, and serrated parallel plates, as well as with the mini-cone spread test. Discrepancies in yield stress values are observed for cement pastes at various volume fractions, with one to two orders of magnitude difference between vane, helical and mini-cone spread measurements on the one hand, and co-axial cylinder and parallel plate measurements on the other hand. To understand this discrepancy, the flow profile of a cement paste in the parallel-plate geometry is investigated with a high-speed camera, revealing the rapid formation of an un-sheared band near the static bottom plate. The width of this band depends upon the rotational velocity of the top plate, and upon the shear time. Recalculation of shear stress shows that the reduced sheared gap alone cannot explain the low measured yield stress. Further exploration suggests the formation of zones with lower particle content, possibly linked to cement particle sedimentation. Here, we argue that the complex nature of cement pastes, composed of negatively buoyant non-Brownian particles with attractive interactions due to highly charged nano-size hydration products, accounts for their complex rheological behavior.</description>

      <title>Diffusion, viscosity and linear rheology of valence-limited disordered fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the dynamics and linear rheology of disordered systems made of patchy particles, focussing on the role of valence, temperature and bonding mechanism. We demonstrate that the dynamics is enslaved to bonding, giving rise to an activated behaviour at low temperature. By independently computing the diffusion constant and the viscosity from the simulations, we also confirm the validity of the Stokes-Einstein relation in valence-limited systems, with two caveats: (i) the diffusion constant requires a finite-size correction, at least at the intermediate density we investigate, and (ii) there is the onset of a breakdown that appears at the lowest temperatures considered. Finally, our results show that the storage and loss moduli of mixtures of divalent and $M$-valent particles exhibit an apparent power-law dependence on frequency, hinting at the possibility of using the composition to finely tune the rheological response of these materials. Our results compare well with literature experimental data on valence-limited DNA nanostars. In addition, the wealth of data we present and analyse here will help to develop and test theoretical frameworks aimed at describing the dynamics of flexible limited-valence particles that self-assemble into disordered networks.</description>

      <title>Fast event-driven simulations for soft spheres: from dynamics to Laves phase nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations struggle when simulating particles with steeply varying interaction potentials, due to the need to use a very short time step. Here, we demonstrate that an event-driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) approach first introduced by Peters and de With [Phys. Rev. E 85, 026703 (2012)] represents an excellent substitute for MD in the canonical ensemble. In addition to correctly reproducing the static thermodynamic properties of the system, the EDMC method closely mimics the dynamics of systems of particles interacting via the steeply repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential. In comparison to time-driven MD simulations, EDMC runs faster by over an order of magnitude at sufficiently low temperatures. Moreover, the lack of a finite time step in EDMC circumvents the need to trade accuracy against simulation speed associated with the choice of time step in MD. We showcase the usefulness of this model to explore the phase behavior of the WCA model at extremely low temperatures, and to demonstrate that spontaneous nucleation and growth of the Laves phases is possible at temperatures significantly lower than previously reported.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Density Functional Theory with Inertia and Background Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) incorporating general inhomogeneous, incompressible, time dependent background flows and inertia, describing externally driven passive colloidal systems out of equilibrium. We start by considering the underlying nonequilibrium Langevin dynamics, including the effect of the local velocity of the surrounding liquid bath, to obtain the nonlinear, nonlocal partial differential equations governing the evolution of the (coarse--grained) density and velocity fields describing the dynamics of colloids. Additionally, we show both with heuristic arguments, and by numerical solution, that our equations and solutions agree with existing DDFTs in the overdamped (high friction) limit. We provide numerical solutions that model the flow of hard spheres, in both unbounded and confined domains, and compare to previously--derived DDFTs with and without the background flow.</description>

      <title>Phase field modelling of the detachment of bubbles from a solid substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the evolution and detachment of a gas bubble resting on a solid substrate and surrounded by a viscous liquid. The bubble has a static contact angle $\theta $ and will be subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the cricital Bond number over which bubbles detach from the substrate. Then, we perform similar studies for bubble resting on inclined substrates and bubbles under the action of an external flow. We provide approximate formulas for the critical Bond number under all these circumstances. Our method is also able to resolve the pinchoff of the bubble and the possible appearence of satellites.</description>

      <title>On the interplay of liquid-like and stress-driven dynamics in a metallic glass former observed by temperature scanning XPCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern detector technology and highly brilliant fourth-generation synchrotrons allow to improve the temporal resolution in time-resolved diffraction studies. Profiting from this, we applied temperature scanning X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to probe the dynamics of a Pt-based metallic glass former in the glass, glass transition region, and supercooled liquid, covering up to six orders of magnitude in time scales. Our data demonstrates that the structural alpha-relaxation process is still observable in the glass, although it is partially masked by a faster source of decorrelation observed at atomic scale. We present an approach that interprets these findings as the superposition of heterogeneous liquid-like and stress-driven ballistic-like atomic motions. This work not only extends the dynamical range probed by standard isothermal XPCS, but also clarifies the fate of the alpha-relaxation across the glass transition and provides a new perception on the anomalous, compressed temporal decay of the density-density correlation functions observed in metallic glasses and many out-of-equilibrium soft materials.</description>

      <title>Surfactant-laden liquid thread breakup driven by thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The breakup of liquid threads into droplets is crucial in various applications, such as nanoprinting, nanomanufacturing, and inkjet printing, where a detailed understanding of the thinning neck dynamics allows for a precise droplet control. Here, the role of surfactant in the breakup process is studied by many-body dissipative particle dynamics, in particular, the various regime transitions and thread profiles, shedding light on molecular-level intricacies of this process hitherto inaccessible to continuum theory and experiments. Moreover, the role of surfactant in the most unstable perturbation, the formed droplet size, and surfactant distributions have been unraveled. As surfactant concentration rises, both the wavelength and time to breakup steadily increase due to the lowering of surface tension below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and viscous effects introduced by micelles above the CMC. These changes prior to the breakup lead to larger droplets being formed in cases with higher surfactant concentration. We also compared the thinning dynamics to existing theoretical predictions, revealing that the surfactant-laden breakup starts at the inertial regime and transitions into the thermal fluctuation regime when the concentration is increased. Thus, we illuminate the hitherto poorly investigated and intricate breakup process of surfactant-laden liquid threads driven by thermal fluctuations, contributing to a deeper understanding of this process at molecular scales.</description>

      <title>Water Aging Effects on Graphene Nanoplatelets and Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube Reinforced Epoxy Glass Fiber Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanocomposites reinforced with hybrid fillers of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were developed, aimed at improving electrical and morphological properties of the hybrid nanocomposites while reducing the cost of the final product. GNPs and MWCNTs nanofillers have shown improved electrical and morphological properties with most polymers. In this work, the effect of short-term water aging for 1440 h on MCWNTs and GNPs reinforced epoxy glass fiber nanocomposites was studied. Epoxy nanocomposites were prepared with varying combinations of MCWNTs and GNPs (2:1, 2:2, and 2:3wt. %) as conducting fillers and their electrical conductivity was evaluated after short-term water aging. It was shown that the addition of MCWNTs and GNPs enhanced the electrical conductivity of composites: A low percolation threshold was achieved with 2 wt. % MCWNTs and 3 wt. % GNPs. The addition of MCWNTs enhanced the electrical conductivity and dielectric constant, confirming the synergistic effect of CNTs as multifunctional filler. Microstructural investigations and morphology of nanocomposites were investigated using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The novelty of this work arises from the combination of two conducting fillers with different geometry and aspect ratios as well as different dispersion characteristics. The results obtained from the electrical measurements after water aging on hybrid nanocomposites indicates slight increases in electrical conductivity.</description>

Abstract: Although the free energy of a genome packing into a virus is dominated by DNA-DNA interactions, ordering of the DNA inside the capsid is elasticity-driven, suggesting general solutions with DNA organized into spool-like domains. Using analytical calculations and computer simulations of a long elastic filament confined to a spherical container, we show that the ground state is not a single spool as assumed hitherto, but an ordering mosaic of multiple homogeneously-ordered domains. At low densities, we observe concentric spools, while at higher densities, other morphologies emerge, which resemble topological links. We discuss our results in the context of metallic wires, viral DNA, and flexible polymers.</description>

      <title>Immersed boundary method for dynamic simulation of polarizable colloids of arbitrary shape in explicit ion electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a computational method for modeling electrostatic interactions of arbitrarily-shaped, polarizable objects on colloidal length scales, including colloids/nanoparticles, polymers, and surfactants, dispersed in explicit ion electrolytes and nonionic solvents. Our method computes the nonuniform polarization charge distribution induced in a colloidal particle by both externally applied electric fields and local electric fields arising from other charged objects in the dispersion. This leads to expressions for electrostatic energies, forces, and torques that enable efficient molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations of colloidal dispersions in electrolytes, which can be harnessed to accurately predict structural and transport properties. We describe an implementation in which colloidal particles are modeled as rigid composites of small spherical beads that tessellate the surface of the particle. The electrostatics calculations are accelerated using a spectrally-accurate particle-mesh-Ewald technique implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU) and regularized such that the electrostatic calculations are well-defined even for overlapping bodies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a series of calculations, including the induced dipole moments and forces for one, two, and lattices of spherical colloids in an electric field; the induced dipole moment and torque for anisotropic particles in an electric field; the equilibrium distribution of ions in the double layer around charged colloids; the dynamics of charged colloids; and ions in the double layer around a polarizable colloid exposed to an electric field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects, which are singular points in a director field, play a major role in shaping active systems. Here, we experimentally study topological defects and the flow patterns around them, that are formed during the highly rapid dynamics of swarming bacteria. The results are compared to the predictions of two-dimensional active nematics. We show that, even though some of the assumptions underlying the theory do not hold, the swarm dynamics is in agreement with two-dimensional nematic theory. In particular, we look into the multi-layered structure of the swarm, which is an important feature of real, natural colonies, and find a strong coupling between layers. Our results suggest that the defect-charge density is hyperuniform, i.e., that long range density-fluctuations are suppressed.</description>

Abstract: It has been recently shown that it is possible to design simple artificial swimmers at low Reynoldsnumber that possess only one degree of freedom and, nevertheless, can overcome Purcell's celebratedscallop theorem. One of the few examples is given by Montino and DeSimone, Eur. Phys. J. E, vol.38, 2015, who consider the three-sphere Swimmer of Najafi and Golestanian, replacing one active armwith a passive elastic spring. We further generalize this idea by increasing the number of springs andshow that it is possible to invert the swimming direction using the frequency of the single actuatedarm.</description>

Abstract: During eukaryotic cell division, a microtubule-based structure called the spindle exerts forces on chromosomes, thereby organizing and segregating them Extensive work demonstrates that the forces acting parallel to the spindle axis, including those responsible for separating sister chromatids, are generated by microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, and molecular-motors. In contrast, little is known about the forces acting perpendicular to the spindle axis, which determine the configuration of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, and thus impact nuclear localization and rates of segregation errors. Here, we use quantitative live-cell microscopy to show that metaphase chromosomes are spatially anti-correlated in mouse oocyte spindles, indicating the existence of hitherto unknown long-range forces acting perpendicular to the spindle axis. We explain this observation by first demonstrating that the spindle's microtubule network behaves as a nematic liquid crystal, and then arguing that deformation of the nematic field around embedded chromosomes causes long-range repulsion between them. Our work highlights the surprising relevance of materials physics in understanding the structure, dynamics, and mechanics of cellular structures, and presents a novel and potentially generic mode of chromosome organization in large spindles.</description>

Abstract: One of the fundamental steps toward understanding a complex system is identifying variation at the scale of the system's components that is most relevant to behavior on a macroscopic scale. Mutual information provides a natural means of linking variation across scales of a system due to its independence of functional relationship between observables. However, characterizing the manner in which information is distributed across a set of observables is computationally challenging and generally infeasible beyond a handful of measurements. Here we propose a practical and general methodology that uses machine learning to decompose the information contained in a set of measurements by jointly optimizing a lossy compression of each measurement. Guided by the distributed information bottleneck as a learning objective, the information decomposition identifies the variation in the measurements of the system state most relevant to specified macroscale behavior. We focus our analysis on two paradigmatic complex systems: a Boolean circuit and an amorphous material undergoing plastic deformation. In both examples, the large amount of entropy of the system state is decomposed, bit by bit, in terms of what is most related to macroscale behavior. The identification of meaningful variation in data, with the full generality brought by information theory, is made practical for studying the connection between micro- and macroscale structure in complex systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the work fluctuations in an overdamped non-equilibrium process that is stopped at a stochastic time. The latter is characterized by a first passage event that marks the completion of the non-equilibrium process. In particular, we consider a particle diffusing in one dimension in the presence of a time-dependent potential $U(x,t) = k |x-vt|^n/n$, where $k&gt;0$ is the stiffness and $n&gt;0$ is the order of the potential. Moreover, the particle is confined between two absorbing walls, located at $L_{\pm}(t) $, that move with a constant velocity $v$ and are initially located at $L_{\pm}(0) = \pm L$. As soon as the particle reaches any of the boundaries, the process is said to be completed and here, we compute the work done $W$ by the particle in the modulated trap upto this random time. Employing the Feynman-Kac path integral approach, we find that the typical values of the work scale with $L$ with a crucial dependence on the order $n$. While for $n&gt;1$, we show that $\mom{W} \sim L^{1-n}~\exp \left[ \left( {k L^{n}}/{n}-v L \right)/D \right] $ for large $L$, we get an algebraic scaling of the form $\mom{W} \sim L^n$ for the $n&lt;1$ case. The marginal case of $n=1$ is exactly solvable and our analysis unravels three distinct scaling behaviours: (i) $\mom{W} \sim L$ for $v&gt;k$, (ii) $\mom{W} \sim L^2$ for $v=k$ and (iii) $\mom{W} \sim \exp\left[{-(v-k)L}\right]$ for $v&lt;k$. For all cases, we also obtain the probability distribution associated with the typical values of $W$. Finally, we observe an interesting set of relations between the relative fluctuations of the work done and the first-passage time for different $n$ -- which we argue physically. Our results are well supported by the numerical simulations.</description>
