      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Computing the Linear Vertex Arboricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{linear vertex arboricity} of a graph is the smallest number of sets into which the vertices of a graph can be partitioned so that each of these sets induces a linear forest. Chaplick et al. [JoCG 2020] showed that, somewhat surprisingly, the linear vertex arboricity of a graph is the same as the \emph{3D weak line cover number} of the graph, that is, the minimum number of straight lines necessary to cover the vertices of a crossing-free straight-line drawing of the graph in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Chaplick et al. [JGAA 2023] showed that deciding whether a given graph has linear vertex arboricity 2 is NP-hard.
  In this paper, we investigate the parameterized complexity of computing the linear vertex arboricity. We show that the problem is para-NP-hard with respect to the parameter maximum degree. Our result is tight in the following sense. All graphs of maximum degree 4 (except for $K_4$) have linear vertex arboricity at most 2, whereas we show that it is NP-hard to decide, given a graph of maximum degree 5, whether its linear vertex arboricity is 2. Moreover, we show that, for planar graphs, the same question is NP-hard for graphs of maximum degree 6, leaving open the maximum-degree-5 case. Finally, we prove that, for any $k \ge 1$, deciding whether the linear vertex arboricity of a graph is at most $k$ is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the treewidth of the given graph.</description>

      <title>Matrix Multiplication in the MPC Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the matrix multiplication problem in the MPC model. We have two matrices, and the task is to compute their product. These matrices are evenly distributed over $P$ processors. Each processor has $M$ memory such that $P \cdot M \geq $ (size of the matrices). The computation proceeds in synchronous rounds. In a communication round, a processor can send and receive messages to(from) any other processor, with the total size of messages sent or received being $O(M)$. We give an almost complete characterisation of the problem in various settings. We prove tight upper bounds and lower bounds for the problems in three different settings--when the given input matrices are (i) general square matrices, (ii) rectangular matrices, and (iii) sparse square matrices (that is, each row and column contains a bounded number of nonzero elements). In particular, we prove the following results:
  1. Multiplication of two $n \times n$ matrices in the MPC model with $n^\alpha$ processors each with $O(n^{2-\alpha})$ memory, requires $\Theta(n^{\frac{\alpha}{2}})$ rounds in semirings.
  2. Multiplication of two rectangular matrices of size $n \times d$ and $d \times n$ (where $d \leq n$) respectively, with $n$ processors of $O(n)$ memory requires $\Theta(\frac{d}{\sqrt{n}})$ rounds in semirings.
  3. Multiplication of two rectangular matrices of size $d \times n$ and $n \times d$ ( where $d \leq n$) respectively requires
  i. $\Theta(\sqrt{d} + \log_d n)$ rounds with $n$ processors and $O(d)$ memory per processor in semirings
  ii. $\Theta (\frac{d}{\sqrt{n}})$ rounds with $d$ processors and $O(n)$ memory per processor in semirings.
  4. Multiplication of two $d$-sparse matrices (each row and column of the matrices contains at most $d$-nonzero elements) with $n$ processors and $O(d)$ memory per processor can be done in $O(d^{0.9})$ rounds in semirings.</description>

      <title>Marginal Fairness: Fair Decision-Making under Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces marginal fairness, a new individual fairness notion for equitable decision-making in the presence of protected attributes such as gender, race, and religion. This criterion ensures that decisions based on generalized distortion risk measures are insensitive to distributional perturbations in protected attributes, regardless of whether these attributes are continuous, discrete, categorical, univariate, or multivariate. To operationalize this notion and reflect real-world regulatory environments (such as the EU gender-neutral pricing regulation), we model business decision-making in highly regulated industries (such as insurance and finance) as a two-step process: (i) a predictive modeling stage, in which a prediction function for the target variable (e.g., insurance losses) is estimated based on both protected and non-protected covariates; and (ii) a decision-making stage, in which a generalized distortion risk measure is applied to the target variable, conditional only on non-protected covariates, to determine the decision. In this second step, we modify the risk measure such that the decision becomes insensitive to the protected attribute, thus enforcing fairness to ensure equitable outcomes under risk-sensitive, regulatory constraints. Furthermore, by utilizing the concept of cascade sensitivity, we extend the marginal fairness framework to capture how dependencies between covariates propagate the influence of protected attributes through the modeling pipeline. A numerical study and an empirical implementation using an auto insurance dataset demonstrate how the framework can be applied in practice.</description>

      <title>Exact Expressive Power of Transformers with Padding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain of thought is a natural inference-time method for increasing the computational power of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), but comes at the cost of sequential decoding. Are there more efficient alternatives to expand a transformer's expressive power without adding parameters? We consider transformers with padding tokens as a form of parallelizable test-time compute. We show that averaging-hard-attention, masked-pre-norm transformers with polynomial padding converge to precisely the class $\mathsf{TC}^0$ of extremely parallelizable problems. While the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ upper bound was known, proving a matching lower bound had been elusive. Further, our novel analysis reveals the precise expanded power of padded transformers when coupled with another form of inference-time compute, namely dynamically increasing depth via looping. Our core technical contribution is to show how padding helps bring the notions of complete problems and reductions, which have been a cornerstone of classical complexity theory, to the formal study of transformers. Armed with this new tool, we prove that padded transformers with $O(\log^d n)$ looping on inputs of length $n$ recognize exactly the class $\mathsf{TC}^d$ of moderately parallelizable problems. Thus, padding and looping together systematically expand transformers' expressive power: with polylogarithmic looping, padded transformers converge to the class $\mathsf{NC}$, the best that could be expected without losing parallelism (unless $\mathsf{NC} = \mathsf{P}$). Our results thus motivate further exploration of padding and looping as parallelizable alternatives to chain of thought.</description>

      <title>Better Extension Variables in DQBF via Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that extension variables in (D)QBF can be generalised by conditioning on universal assignments. The benefit of this is that the dependency sets of such conditioned extension variables can be made smaller to allow easier refutations. This simple modification instantly solves many challenges in p-simulating the QBF expansion rule, which cannot be p-simulated in proof systems that have strategy extraction. Simulating expansion is even more crucial in DQBF, where other methods are incomplete. In this paper we provide an overview of the strength of this new independent extension rule. We find that a new version of Extended Frege called IndExtFrege+Red can p-simulate a multitude of difficult QBF and DQBF techniques, even techniques that are difficult to approach with ExtFrege+Red. We show six p-simulations, that IndExtFrege+Red p-simulates QRAT, IR(D)-Calc, Q(Drrs)-Res, Fork Resolution, DQRAT and G, which together underpin most DQBF solving and preprocessing techniques. The p-simulations work despite these systems using complicated rules and our new extension rule being relatively simple. Moreover, unlike recent p-simulations by ExtFrege+Red we can simulate the proof rules line by line, which allows us to mix QBF rules more easily with other inference steps.</description>

      <title>On Efficient Noncommutative Polynomial Factorization via Higman Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of efficiently factorizing polynomials in the free noncommutative ring F of polynomials in noncommuting variables x1,x2,...,xn over the field F. We obtain the following result
  Given a noncommutative algebraic branching program of size s computing a noncommutative polynomial f in F as input, where F=Fq is a finite field, we give a randomized algorithm that runs in time polynomial in s, n and log q that computes a factorization of the polynomial f as a product f=f1f2...fr, where each fi is an irreducible polynomial that is output as a noncommutative algebraic branching program.
  The algorithm works by first transforming the given algebraic branching program computing f into a linear matrix L using Higman's linearization of polynomials. We then factorize the linear matrix L and recover the factorization of the polynomial f. We use basic elements from Cohn's theory of free ideals rings combined with Ronyai's randomized polynomial-time algorithm for computing invariant subspaces of a collection of matrices over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and complexity for monitoring edge-geodetic sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set of a graph is a subset $M$ of its vertices such that for every edge $e$ in the graph, deleting $e$ increases the distance between at least one pair of vertices in $M$. We study the following computational problem \textsc{MEG-set}: given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide whether $G$ has a monitoring edge geodetic set of size at most $k$. We prove that the problem is NP-hard even for 2-apex 3-degenerate graphs, improving a result by Haslegrave (Discrete Applied Mathematics 2023). Additionally, we prove that the problem cannot be solved in subexponential-time, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, even for 3-degenerate graphs. Further, we prove that the optimization version of the problem is APX-hard, even for 4-degenerate graphs. Complementing these hardness results, we prove that the problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm for interval graphs, a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for general graphs with clique-width plus diameter as the parameter, and a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for chordal graphs with treewidth as the parameter. We also provide an approximation algorithm with factor $\ln m\cdot OPT$ and $\sqrt{n\ln m}$ for the optimization version of the problem, where $m$ is the number of edges, $n$ the number of vertices, and $OPT$ is the size of a minimum monitoring edge-geodetic set of the input graph.</description>

      <title>Weighted Pseudorandom Generators for Read-Once Branching Programs via Weighted Pseudorandom Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study weighted pseudorandom generators (WPRGs) and derandomizations for read-once branching programs (ROBPs). Denote $n$ and $w$ as the length and the width of a ROBP. We have the following results.
  For standard ROBPs, there exists an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length $$ O\left(\frac{\log n\log (nw)}{\max\left\{1,\log\log w-\log\log n\right\}}+\log w \left(\log\log\log w-\log\log\max\left\{2,\frac{\log w}{\log n/\varepsilon}\right\}\right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right).$$ When $n = w^{o(1)},$ this is better than the constructions in Hoza (RANDOM 2022), Cohen, Doron, Renard, Sberlo, and Ta-Shma (CCC 2021).Further, by using this result in a black-box way, we attain a WPRG for regular ROBPs with seed length $$O\left(\log n\left(\sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)}+\log w+\log\log n\right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right).$$ This slightly improves the result of Chen, Hoza, Lyu, Tal, and Wu (FOCS 2023) and matches the recent simultaneous and independent work of Chen and Ta-shma.
  For permutation ROBPs with unbounded widths and single accept nodes, there exists an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length $$ O\left( \log n\left( \log\log n + \sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)} \right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right). $$ This slightly improves the result of Chen, Hoza, Lyu, Tal, and Wu (FOCS 2023).
  For regular ROBPs with $n \leq 2^{O(\sqrt{\log w})}, \varepsilon = 1/\text{poly} w$, we give a derandomization within space $O(\log w)$, i.e. in $\mathbf{L}$ exactly.
  This is better than previous results of Ahmadinejad, Kelner, Murtagh, Peebles, Sidford, and Vadhan (FOCS 2020) in this regime, and we improves the time complexity from super-polynomial to standard polynomial.
  Our main method is based on a recursive application of weighted pseudorandom reductions, which is a natural notion that is used to simplify ROBPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class TotP consists of functions that count the number of all paths of a nondeterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. In this paper, we give a second definition of the class TotP in terms of certificates and verifiers, and present a few natural closure properties of this class. From the second definition of TotP it follows that TotP = #P if and only if P = NP. We also prove that the closure of TotP under left composition with the class FP+ is equivalent to TotP = FP+ and P = PP, and give examples of FP+-functions such that if TotP is closed under composition with them, then it is closed under composition with FP+.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14326v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
  This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
  Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.</description>

Abstract: The binary perceptron problem asks us to find a sign vector in the intersection of independently chosen random halfspaces with intercept $-\kappa$. We analyze the performance of the canonical discrepancy minimization algorithms of Lovett-Meka and Rothvoss/Eldan-Singh for the asymmetric binary perceptron problem. We obtain new algorithmic results in the $\kappa = 0$ case and in the large-$|\kappa|$ case. In the $\kappa\to-\infty$ case, we additionally characterize the storage capacity and complement our algorithmic results with an almost-matching overlap-gap lower bound.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squares Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</description>

      <title>Provably Overwhelming Transformer Models with Designed Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm which, given a trained transformer model $\mathcal{M}$ as input, as well as a string of tokens $s$ of length $n_{fix}$ and an integer $n_{free}$, can generate a mathematical proof that $\mathcal{M}$ is ``overwhelmed'' by $s$, in time and space $\widetilde{O}(n_{fix}^2 + n_{free}^3)$. We say that $\mathcal{M}$ is ``overwhelmed'' by $s$ when the output of the model evaluated on this string plus any additional string $t$, $\mathcal{M}(s + t)$, is completely insensitive to the value of the string $t$ whenever length($t$) $\leq n_{free}$. Along the way, we prove a particularly strong worst-case form of ``over-squashing'', which we use to bound the model's behavior. Our technique uses computer-aided proofs to establish this type of operationally relevant guarantee about transformer models. We empirically test our algorithm on a single layer transformer complete with an attention head, layer-norm, MLP/ReLU layers, and RoPE positional encoding. We believe that this work is a stepping stone towards the difficult task of obtaining useful guarantees for trained transformer models.</description>

      <title>Parallel Kac's Walk Generates PRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ma and Huang recently proved that the PFC construction, introduced by Metger, Poremba, Sinha and Yuen [MPSY24], gives an adaptive-secure pseudorandom unitary family PRU. Their proof developed a new path recording technique [MH24].
  In this work, we show that a linear number of sequential repetitions of the parallel Kac's Walk, introduced by Lu, Qin, Song, Yao and Zhao [LQSY+24], also forms an adaptive-secure PRU, confirming a conjecture therein. Moreover, it additionally satisfies strong security against adversaries making inverse queries. This gives an alternative PRU construction, and provides another instance demonstrating the power of the path recording technique. We also discuss some further simplifications and implications.</description>
