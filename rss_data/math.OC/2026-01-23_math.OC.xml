      <title>Understanding FISTA's weak convergence: A step-by-step introduction to the 2025 milestone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beck and Teboulle's FISTA for finding the minimizer of the sum of two convex functions is one of the most important algorithms of the past decades. While function value convergence of the iterates was known, the actual convergence of the iterates remained elusive until October 2025 when Jang and Ryu, as well as Bo\c{t}, Fadili, and Nguyen proved weak convergence.
  In this paper, we provide a gentle self-contained introduction to the proof of their remarkable result.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of coupled random dynamical systems with multiscale aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a class of stochastic differential inclusions involving multiscale effects designed to solve a class of generalized variational inequalities. This class of problems contains constrained convex non-smooth optimization problems, constrained saddle-point problems and various equilibrium problems in economics and engineering. In order to respect constraints we adopt a penalty approach, introducing an explicit time-dependency into the evolution system. The resulting dynamics are described in terms of a non-autonomous stochastic evolution equation governed by maximally monotone operators in the drift and perturbed by a Brownian motion. We study the asymptotic behavior, as well as finite time convergence rates in terms of gap functions. The condition we use to prove convergence involves a Legendre transform of the function describing the set C, a condition first used by Attouch and Czarnecki (J. Differ. Equations, Vol. 248, Issue 6, 2010) in the context of deterministic evolution equations. We also establish a large deviations principle showing that individual trajectories exhibit exponential concentration around the solution set. Finally we show how our continuous-time approach relates to penalty-regulated algorithms of forward-backward type after performing a suitable Euler-Maruyama discretisation.</description>

      <title>Folklore in Multi-Objective Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present and prove some results in multi-objective optimisation that are considered folklore. For the most part, proofs for these results exist in special cases, but they are used in more general settings since their proofs can be (largely) transferred. We do this transfer explicitly and try to state the results as generally as possible. In particular, we also aim at providing clean and complete proofs for results where the original papers are not rigorous.</description>

      <title>Variable Stepsize Distributed Forward-Backward Splitting Methods as Relocated Fixed-Point Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of distributed forward-backward methods with variable stepsizes to find a solution of structured monotone inclusion problems. The framework is constructed by means of relocated fixed-point iterations, extending the approach introduced in arXiv:2507.07428 to conically averaged operators, thus including iteration operators for methods of forward-backward type devised by graphs. The family of methods we construct preserve the per-iteration computational cost and the convergence properties of their constant stepsize counterparts. Specifically, we show that the resulting methods generate a sequence that converges to a fixed-point of the underlying iteration operator, whose shadow sequences converge to a solution of the problem. Numerical experiments illustrate the behaviour of our framework in structured sparse optimisation problems.</description>

      <title>Lead distance under a pickoff limit in Major League Baseball: A sequential game model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major League Baseball (MLB) recently limited pitchers to three pickoff attempts, creating a cat-and-mouse game between pitcher and runner. Each failed attempt adds pressure on the pitcher to avoid using another, and the runner can intensify this pressure by extending their leadoff toward the next base. We model this dynamic as a two-player zero-sum sequential game in which the runner first chooses a lead distance, and then the pitcher chooses whether to attempt a pickoff. We establish optimality characterizations for the game and present variants of value iteration and policy iteration to solve the game. Using lead distance data, we estimate generalized linear mixed-effects models for pickoff and stolen base outcome probabilities given lead distance, context, and player skill. We compute the game-theoretic equilibria under the two-player model, as well as the optimal runner policy under a simplified one-player Markov decision process (MDP) model. In the one-player setting, our results establish an actionable rule of thumb: the Two-Foot Rule, which recommends that a runner increase their lead by two feet after each pickoff attempt.</description>

      <title>Parallelizable Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Non-convex Pose Graph Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pose graph optimization (PGO) is fundamental to robot perception and navigation systems, serving as the mathematical backbone for solving simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Existing solvers suffer from polynomial growth in computational complexity with graph size, hindering real-time deployment in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, by duplicating variables and introducing equality constraints, we reformulate the problem and propose a Parallelizable Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PRADMM) to solve it efficiently. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods that usually exhibit polynomial time complexity growth with graph size, PRADMM enables efficient parallel computation across vertices regardless of graph size. Crucially, all subproblems admit closed-form solutions, ensuring PRADMM maintains exceptionally stable performance. Furthermore, by carefully exploiting the structures of the coefficient matrices in the constraints, we establish the global convergence of PRADMM under mild conditions, enabling larger relaxation step sizes within the interval $(0,2)$. Extensive empirical validation on two synthetic datasets and multiple real-world 3D SLAM benchmarks confirms the superior computational performance of PRADMM.</description>

      <title>A sequential linear complementarity problem method for generalized Nash equilibrium problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a sequential linear complementarity problem (SLCP) method for solving generalized Nash equilibrium problems (GNEPs). By introducing a novel merit function that utilizes the specific structure of GNEPs, we establish global convergence of the method. The conditions guaranteeing global convergence are analogous to those for the classical sequential quadratic programming method with exact Lagrange Hessians, making this a natural and reasonable generalization. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the solvability of the mixed linear complementarity subproblems, which are formulated as affine GNEPs. Sufficient characterizations for the local superlinear convergence are also derived, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed method. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the practical performance and effectiveness of the SLCP method in comparison with existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let A, B be symmetric n x n real matrices with B positive definite and strictly diagonally dominant. We derive two localization sets for the complementarity eigenvalues of (A, B), the tightest one assuming additionally that A is copositive. This extends He-Liu-Shen sets to the case where B is not the identity. Moreover, we compare the computable bounds obtained from these new sets with the extreme classical generalized eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Progressive Power Homotopy for Non-convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel first-order method for non-convex optimization of the form $\max_{\bm{w}\in\mathbb{R}^d}\mathbb{E}_{\bm{x}\sim\mathcal{D}}[f_{\bm{w}}(\bm{x})]$, termed Progressive Power Homotopy (Prog-PowerHP). The method applies stochastic gradient ascent to a surrogate objective obtained by first performing a power transformation and then Gaussian smoothing, $F_{N,\sigma}(\bm{\mu}):=\mathbb{E}_{\bm{w}\sim\mathcal{N}(\bm{\mu},\sigma^2I_d),\bm{x}\sim\mathcal{D}}[e^{Nf_w(\bm{x})}]$, while progressively increasing the power parameter $N$ and decreasing the smoothing scale $\sigma$ along the optimization trajectory. We prove that, under mild regularity conditions, Prog-PowerHP converges to a small neighborhood of the global optimum with an iteration complexity scaling nearly as $O(d^2\varepsilon^{-2})$. Empirically, Prog-PowerHP demonstrates clear advantages in phase retrieval when the samples-to-dimension ratio approaches the information-theoretic limit, and in training two-layer neural networks in under-parameterized regimes. These results suggest that Prog-PowerHP is particularly effective for navigating cluttered non-convex landscapes where standard first-order methods struggle.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple proof of the worst-case iteration complexity for the Difference of Convex functions Algorithm (DCA) for unconstrained minimization, showing that the global rate of convergence of the norm of the objective function's gradients at the iterates converge to zero like o(1/k). A small example is also provided indicating that the rate cannot be improved.</description>

      <title>Minimax-optimal Halpern iterations for Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the minimax-optimality of Halpern fixed-point iterations for Lipschitz maps in general normed spaces. Starting from an a priori bound on the orbit of iterates, we derive non-asymptotic estimates for the fixed-point residuals. These bounds are tight, meaning that they are attained by a suitable Lipschitz map and an associated Halpern sequence. By minimizing these tight bounds we identify the minimax-optimal Halpern scheme. For contractions, the optimal iteration exhibits a transition from an initial Halpern phase to the classical Banach-Picard iteration and, as the Lipschitz constant approaches one, we recover the known convergence rate for nonexpansive maps. For expansive maps, the algorithm is purely Halpern with no Banach-Picard phase; moreover, on bounded domains, the residual estimates converge to the minimal displacement bound. Inspired by the minimax-optimal iteration, we design an adaptive scheme whose residuals are uniformly smaller than the minimax-optimal bounds, and can be significantly sharper in practice. Finally, we extend the analysis by introducing alternative bounds based on the distance to a fixed point, which allow us to handle mappings on unbounded domains; including the case of affine maps for which we also identify the minimax-optimal iteration.</description>

      <title>Time-Optimal Switching Surfaces for Triple Integrator under Full Box Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-optimal control for triple integrator under full box constraints is a fundamental problem in the field of optimal control, which has been widely applied in the industry. However, scenarios involving asymmetric constraints, non-stationary boundary conditions, and active position constraints pose significant challenges. This paper provides a complete characterization of time-optimal switching surfaces for the problem, leading to novel insights into the geometric and algebraic structure of the optimal control. The active condition of position constraints is derived, which is absent from the literature. An efficient algorithm is proposed, capable of planning time-optimal trajectories under asymmetric full constraints and arbitrary boundary states, with a 100% success rate. Computational time for each trajectory is within approximately 10{\mu}s, achieving a 5-order-of-magnitude reduction compared to optimization-based baselines.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Dynamical System for Solving Generalized Inverse Mixed Variational Inequality problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of generalized inverse mixed variational inequality problems (GIMVIPs). We propose a novel projection-based second-order time-varying dynamical system for solving GIMVIPs. Under the assumptions that the underlying operators are strongly monotone and Lipschitz continuous, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solution trajectories and prove their global exponential convergence to the unique solution of the GIMVIP. Furthermore, a discrete-time realization of the continuous dynamical system is developed, resulting in an inertial projection algorithm. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves linear convergence under suitable choices of parameters. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and convergence behavior of the proposed method in solving GIMVIPs.</description>

      <title>Proximity Operator of the $\ell_1$ over $\ell_2$ Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the proximity operator of the nonconvex, scale-invariant ratio $h(\vx)=\|\vx\|_{1}/\|\vx\|_{2}$ and show it can be computed exactly in any dimension. By expressing $\vx=r\vu$ and exploiting sign and permutation invariance, we reduce the proximal step to a smooth optimization of a rank-one quadratic over the nonnegative orthant of the unit sphere. We prove that every proximal point arises from a finite candidate set indexed by $k\in\{1,\dots,n\}$: the active subvector is a local, but nonglobal, minimizer on $\mathbb{S}^{k-1}$ characterized by the roots of an explicit quartic. This yields closed-form candidates, an exact selection rule, and a necessary and sufficient existence test. Building on these characterizations, we develop practical algorithms, including an $O(n)$ implementation via prefix sums and a pruning criterion that avoids unnecessary quartic solves. The method returns all proximal points when the prox is non-unique, and in experiments it attains strictly lower objective values than approaches that guess sparsity or rely on sphere projections with limited scalability.</description>

      <title>A Rolling-Space Branch-and-Price Algorithm for the Multi-Compartment Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Time Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the multi-compartment vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (MCVRPMTW), an extension of the classical vehicle routing problem with time windows that considers vehicles equipped with multiple compartments and customers requiring service across several delivery time windows. The problem incorporates three key compartment-related features: (i) compartment flexibility in the number of compartments, (ii) item-to-compartment compatibility, and (iii) item-to-item compatibility. The problem also accommodates practical operational requirements such as driver breaks. To solve the MCVRPMTW, we develop an exact branch-and-price (B&amp;P) algorithm in which the pricing problem is solved using a labeling algorithm. Several acceleration strategies are introduced to limit symmetry during label extensions, improve the stability of dual solutions in column generation, and enhance the branching process. To handle large-scale instances, we propose a rolling-space B&amp;P algorithm that integrates clustering techniques into the solution framework. Extensive computational experiments on instances inspired by a real-world industrial application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide useful managerial insights for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Early predicting of hospital admission using machine learning algorithms: Priority queues approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergency Department overcrowding is a critical issue that compromises patient safety and operational efficiency, necessitating accurate demand forecasting for effective resource allocation. This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77. The study concludes that while these techniques successfully reproduce regular day-to-day patterns, they share a common limitation in underestimating sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume.</description>

      <title>Risk reversal for least squares estimators under nested convex constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In constrained stochastic optimization, one naturally expects that imposing a stricter feasible set does not increase the statistical risk of an estimator defined by projection onto that set. In this paper, we show that this intuition can fail even in canonical settings.
  We study the Gaussian sequence model, a deliberately austere test best, where for a compact, convex set $\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ one observes \[ Y = \theta^\star + \sigma Z, \qquad Z \sim N(0, I_d), \] and seeks to estimate an unknown parameter $\theta^\star \in \Theta$. The natural estimator is the least squares estimator (LSE), which coincides with the Euclidean projection of $Y$ onto $\Theta$. We construct an explicit example exhibiting \emph{risk reversal}: for sufficiently large noise, there exist nested compact convex sets $\Theta_S \subset \Theta_L$ and a parameter $\theta^\star \in \Theta_S$ such that the LSE constrained to $\Theta_S$ has strictly larger risk than the LSE constrained to $\Theta_L$. We further show that this phenomenon can persist at the level of worst-case risk, with the supremum risk over the smaller constraint set exceeding that over the larger one.
  We clarify this behavior by contrasting noise regimes. In the vanishing-noise limit, the risk admits a first-order expansion governed by the statistical dimension of the tangent cone at $\theta^\star$, and tighter constraints uniformly reduce risk. In contrast, in the diverging-noise regime, the risk is determined by global geometric interactions between the constraint set and random noise directions. Here, the embedding of $\Theta_S$ within $\Theta_L$ can reverse the risk ordering.
  These results reveal a previously unrecognized failure mode of projection-based estimators: in sufficiently noisy settings, tightening a constraint can paradoxically degrade statistical performance.</description>

      <title>CLASP: An online learning algorithm for Convex Losses And Squared Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO), where a learner chooses actions iteratively, observes both unanticipated convex loss and convex constraint, and accumulates loss while incurring penalties for constraint violations. We introduce CLASP (Convex Losses And Squared Penalties), an algorithm that minimizes cumulative loss together with squared constraint violations. Our analysis departs from prior work by fully leveraging the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, a proof strategy not previously applied in this setting. For convex losses, CLASP achieves regret $O\left(T^{\max\{\beta,1-\beta\}}\right)$ and cumulative squared penalty $O\left(T^{1-\beta}\right)$ for any $\beta \in (0,1)$. Most importantly, for strongly convex problems, CLASP provides the first logarithmic guarantees on both regret and cumulative squared penalty. In the strongly convex case, the regret is upper bounded by $O( \log T )$ and the cumulative squared penalty is also upper bounded by $O( \log T )$.</description>

      <title>Interconnection-based Model Reduction for Linear Hybrid Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the model reduction problem for linear hybrid systems via the interconnection-based technique called moment matching. We consider two classical interconnections, namely the direct and swapped interconnections, in the hybrid setting, and we present families of reduced-order models for each interconnection via a hybrid characterisation of the steady-state responses. By combining the results for each interconnection, the design of a reduced-order model that achieves moment matching simultaneously for both interconnections is studied. In addition, we show that the presented results have simplified counterparts when the jumps of the hybrid system are periodic. A numerical simulation is finally given to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Metric-uniform spectral inequality for the Laplacian on manifolds with bounded sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Riemannian manifold $M$ endowed with a smooth metric $g$ satisfying upper and lower sectional curvature bounds, we show an equivalence property between the $\mathrm{L}^2$ norm on $M$ and the $\mathrm{L}^2$ norm on subsets $\omega$ satisfying a thickness condition, for functions in the range of a spectral projector. The thickness condition is known to be optimal in this setting. The constant appearing in the equivalence of norms property depends only on the dimension of the manifold, curvature bounds, and frequency threshold of the spectral cutoff, but, crucially, not on the injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>Control Occupation Kernel Regression for Nonlinear Control-Affine Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents an algorithm for obtaining an approximation of a nonlinear high order control affine dynamical system. Controlled trajectories of the system are leveraged as the central unit of information via embedding them in vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vvRKHS). The trajectories are embedded as the so-called higher order control occupation kernels which represent an operator on the vvRKHS corresponding to iterated integration after multiplication by a given controller. The solution to the system identification problem is then the unique solution of an infinite dimensional regularized regression problem. The representer theorem is then used to express the solution as finite linear combination of these occupation kernels, which converts an infinite dimensional optimization problem to a finite dimensional optimization problem. The vector valued structure of the Hilbert space allows for simultaneous approximation of the drift and control effectiveness components of the control affine system. Several experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.</description>

      <title>Exact worst-case convergence rates of gradient descent: a complete analysis for all constant stepsizes over nonconvex and convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider gradient descent with constant stepsizes and derive exact worst-case convergence rates on the minimum gradient norm of the iterates. Our analysis covers all possible stepsizes and arbitrary upper/lower bounds on the curvature of the objective function, thus including convex, strongly convex and weakly convex (hypoconvex) objective functions.
  Among the challenging parts of the analysis, we note the necessity to exploit dependencies between non-consecutive iterates. While this complicates the proofs to some extent, it enables us to achieve an exact full-range analysis of gradient descent for any constant stepsize (covering, in particular, normalized stepsizes greater than one), whereas the literature contained only conjectured rates of this type.
  In the nonconvex case, allowing arbitrary bounds on upper and lower curvatures extends existing partial results that are valid only for gradient Lipschitz functions (i.e., where lower and upper bounds on curvature are equal), leading to improved rates for weakly convex functions.
  From our exact worst-case performance bounds, we deduce the optimal constant stepsize for gradient descent. Leveraging our analysis, we also introduce a new variant of gradient descent based on a unique, fixed sequence of variable stepsizes, demonstrating its superiority in the worst-case over any constant stepsize schedule.</description>

      <title>Fare Game: A Mean Field Model of Stochastic Intensity Control in Dynamic Ticket Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing of discrete goods over a finite selling horizon. One way to capture both the elastic and stochastic reaction of purchases to price is through a model where sellers control the intensity of a counting process, representing the number of sales thus far. The intensity describes the probabilistic likelihood of a sale, and is a decreasing function of the price a seller sets. A classical model for ticket pricing, which assumes a single seller and finite time horizon, is by Gallego and van Ryzin (1994) and it has been widely utilized by airlines, for instance. Extending to more realistic settings where there are multiple sellers, with finite inventories, in competition over a finite time horizon is more complicated both mathematically and computationally. We introduce a dynamic mean field game of this type, and some numerical and existence results. In particular, we analyze the associated coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov differential-difference equations, and we prove the existence and uniqueness results under certain conditions. Then, we demonstrate a numerical algorithm to find this solution and provide some insights into the macroeconomic market parameters. Finally, we present a qualitative comparison of our findings with airfare data.</description>

      <title>Rigorous dense graph limit of a model for biological transportation networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously derive the dense graph limit of a discrete model describing the formation of biological transportation networks. The discrete model, defined on undirected graphs with pressure-driven flows, incorporates a convex energy functional combining pumping and metabolic costs. It is constrained by a Kirchhoff law reflecting the local mass conservation. We first rescale and reformulate the discrete energy functional as an integral `semi-discrete' functional, where the Kirchhoff law transforms into a nonlocal elliptic integral equation. Assuming that the sequence of graphs is uniformly connected and that the limiting graphon is 0-1 valued, we prove two results: (1) rigorous Gamma-convergence of the sequence of the semi-discrete functionals to a continuum limit as the number of graph nodes and edges tends to infinity; (2) convergence of global minimizers of the discrete functionals to a global minimizer of the limiting continuum functional. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the continuum description of biological transport structures emerging from discrete networks.</description>

      <title>Time-inconsistent reinsurance and investment optimization problem with delay under random risk aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a newly delayed reinsurance and investment optimization problem incorporating random risk aversion, in which an insurer pursues maximization of the expected certainty equivalent of her/his terminal wealth and the cumulative delayed information of the wealth over a period. Specially, the insurer's surplus dynamics are approximated using a drifted Brownian motion, while the financial market is described by the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model. Moreover, the performance-linked capital flow feature is incorporated and the wealth process is formulated via a stochastic delay differential equation (SDDE). By adopting a game-theoretic approach, a verification theorem with rigorous proofs is established to capture the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategy along with the equilibrium value function. Furthermore, analytical or semi-analytical equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies, together with their equilibrium value functions, are obtained under the CEV model for the exponential utility and derived under the Black-Scholes model for both exponential and power utilities. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the behavioral characteristics of the freshly-derived equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategy.</description>

      <title>Generalized gradient flows in Hadamard manifolds and convex optimization on entanglement polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the optimization problem of minimizing $Q(df_x)$ over a Hadamard manifold ${\cal M}$, where $f$ is a convex function on ${\cal M}$, $df_x$ is the differential of $f$ at $x \in {\cal M}$, and $Q$ is a function on the cotangent bundle of ${\cal M}$. This problem generalizes the problem of minimizing the gradient norm $\|\nabla f(x)\|$ over ${\cal M}$, studied by Hirai and Sakabe FOCS2024. We formulate a natural class of $Q$ in terms of convexity and invariance under parallel transports, and introduce a generalization of the gradient flow of $f$ that is expected to minimize $Q(df_x)$. For basic classes of manifolds, including the product of the manifolds of positive definite matrices, we prove that this gradient flow attains $\inf_{x\in {\cal M}} Q(df_x)$ in the limit, and yields a duality relation. This result is applied to the Kempf-Ness optimization for GL-actions on tensors, which is Euclidean convex optimization on the class of moment polytopes, known as the entanglement polytopes. This type of convex optimization arises from tensor-related subjects in theoretical computer science, such as quantum functional, $G$-stable rank, and noncommutative rank.</description>

      <title>From carbon management strategies to implementation: Modeling and physical simulation of CO2 pipeline infrastructure -- a case study for Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon capture and storage or utilization (CCUS) will play an important role to achieve climate neutrality in many economies. Pipelines are widely regarded as the most efficient means of CO2 transport; however, they are currently non-existent. Policy-makers and companies need to develop large-scale infrastructure under substantial uncertainty. Methods and analyses are needed to support pipeline planning and strategy development. This paper presents an integrated method for designing CO2 pipeline networks by combining energy system scenarios with physical network simulation. Using Germany as a case study, we derive spatially highly resolved CO2 balances to develop a dense-phase CO2 pipeline topology that follows existing gas pipeline corridors. The analyzed system includes existing sites for cement and lime production, waste incineration, carbon users, four coastal CO2 hubs, and border crossing points. We then apply the multiphysical network simulator MYNTS to assess the technical feasibility of this network. We determine pipeline diameters, pump locations, and operating conditions that ensure stable dense-phase transport. The method explicitly accounts for elevation and possible impurities. The results indicate that a system of about 7000 km pipeline length and a mixed normed diameter of DN700 on main corridors and of DN500/DN400 on branches presents a feasible solution to connect most sites. Investment costs for the optimized pipeline system are calculated to be about 17 billion Euros. The method provides a reproducible framework and is transferable to other countries and to European scope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.04312v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expected utility maximization problem of a large investor who is allowed to make transactions on tradable assets in an incomplete financial market with endogenous permanent market impacts. The asset prices are assumed to follow a nonlinear price curve quoted in the market as the utility indifference curve of a representative liquidity supplier. Using generalized subgradients, we show that optimality can be fully characterized via a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) which corresponds to a non-linear backward stochastic partial differential equation (BSPDE). We show existence of solutions to the optimal investment problem and the FBSDEs in the case where the driver function of the representative market maker grows at least quadratically or the utility function of the large investor falls faster than quadratically or is exponential. Furthermore, we derive smoothness results for the existence of solutions of BSPDEs. Examples are provided when the market is complete, the driver is positively homogeneous or the utility function is exponential.</description>

      <title>Integer programs with nearly totally unimodular matrices: the cographic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a notorious open question whether integer programs (IPs), with an integer coefficient matrix $M$ whose subdeterminants are all bounded by a constant $\Delta$ in absolute value, can be solved in polynomial time. We answer this question in the affirmative if we further require that, by removing a constant number of rows and columns from $M$, one obtains a submatrix $A$ that is the transpose of a network matrix.
  Our approach focuses on the case where $A$ arises from $M$ after removing $k$ rows only, where $k$ is a constant. We achieve our result in two main steps, the first related to the theory of IPs and the second related to graph minor theory.
  First, we derive a strong proximity result for the case where $A$ is a general totally unimodular matrix: Given an optimal solution of the linear programming relaxation, an optimal solution to the IP can be obtained by finding a constant number of augmentations by circuits of $[A\; I]$.
  Second, for the case where $A$ is transpose of a network matrix, we reformulate the problem as a maximum constrained integer potential problem on a graph $G$. We observe that if $G$ is $2$-connected, then it has no rooted $K_{2,t}$-minor for $t = \Omega(k \Delta)$. We leverage this to obtain a tree-decomposition of $G$ into highly structured graphs for which we can solve the problem locally. This allows us to solve the global problem via dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Robust Output Tracking for Induced Seismicity Mitigation in Underground Reservoirs Governed by a Nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust output-feedback controller for induced seismicity mitigation in geological reservoirs described by a coupled 3D PDE-ODE model. The controller is a MIMO Super-Twisting design, producing a continuous control signal and requiring minimal model information, while accommodating parameter uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity. Two operational outputs are regulated simultaneously: regional pressures and seismicity rates computed over reservoir sub-regions. Closed-loop properties are established via explicit bounds on the solution and its time derivative for both the infinite-dimensional dynamics and the nonlinear ODE system, yielding finite-time or exponential convergence of the tracking errors. The method is evaluated on a Groningen gas-field case study in two scenarios: gas production while not exceeding the intrinsic seismicity of the region, and combined production with CO$_2$ injection toward net-zero operation. Simulations demonstrate accurate tracking of pressure and seismicity targets across regions under significant parameter uncertainty, supporting safer reservoir operation without sacrificing production objectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices. However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets, enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes, offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Fairness-informed Pareto Optimization : An Efficient Bilevel Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their promise, fair machine learning methods often yield Pareto-inefficient models, in which the performance of certain groups can be improved without degrading that of others. This issue arises frequently in traditional in-processing approaches such as fairness-through-regularization. In contrast, existing Pareto-efficient approaches are biased towards a certain perspective on fairness and fail to adapt to the broad range of fairness metrics studied in the literature. In this paper, we present BADR, a simple framework to recover the optimal Pareto-efficient model for any fairness metric. Our framework recovers its models through a Bilevel Adaptive Rescalarisation procedure. The lower level is a weighted empirical risk minimization task where the weights are a convex combination of the groups, while the upper level optimizes the chosen fairness objective. We equip our framework with two novel large-scale, single-loop algorithms, BADR-GD and BADR-SGD, and establish their convergence guarantees. We release badr, an open-source Python toolbox implementing our framework for a variety of learning tasks and fairness metrics. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the advantages of BADR over existing Pareto-efficient approaches to fairness.</description>

      <title>Small Gradient Norm Regret for Online Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new problem-dependent regret measure for online convex optimization with smooth losses. The notion, which we call the $G^\star$ regret, depends on the cumulative squared gradient norm evaluated at the decision in hindsight $\sum_{t=1}^T \|\nabla \ell(x^\star)\|^2$. We show that the $G^\star$ regret strictly refines the existing $L^\star$ (small loss) regret, and that it can be arbitrarily sharper when the losses have vanishing curvature around the hindsight decision. We establish upper and lower bounds on the $G^\star$ regret and extend our results to dynamic regret and bandit settings. As a byproduct, we refine the existing convergence analysis of stochastic optimization algorithms in the interpolation regime. Some experiments validate our theoretical findings.</description>
