      <title>Adaptive Money Market Interest Rate Strategy Utilizing Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) money markets have seen explosive growth in recent years, with billions of dollars borrowed in various cryptocurrency assets. Key to the safety of money markets is the implementation of interest rates that determine the cost of borrowing, and govern counterparty exposure and return. In traditional markets, interest rates are set by risk managers, portfolio managers, the Federal Reserve, and a myriad of other sources depending on the market function. DeFi enables an algorithmic approach that typically relies on interest rates being directly dependent on market utilization. The benefit of algorithmic interest rate management is the system's continual response to market behaviors in real time, and thus an inherent ability to mitigate risks on behalf of protocols and users. These interest rate strategies target an optimal utilization based on the protocol's risk threshold, but historically lack the ability to compensate for excessive or diminished utilization over time. This research investigates contemporary DeFi interest rate management strategies and their limitations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a time-weighted approach to interest rate management that implements a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control system to constantly adapt to market utilization patterns, addressing observed limitations.</description>

      <title>A nonparametric test for rough volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a nonparametric test for deciding whether volatility of an asset follows a standard semimartingale process, with paths of finite quadratic variation, or a rough process with paths of infinite quadratic variation. The test utilizes the fact that volatility is rough if and only if volatility increments are negatively autocorrelated at high frequencies. It is based on the sample autocovariance of increments of spot volatility estimates computed from high-frequency asset return data. By showing a feasible CLT for this statistic under the null hypothesis of semimartingale volatility paths, we construct a test with fixed asymptotic size and an asymptotic power equal to one. The test is derived under very general conditions for the data-generating process. In particular, it is robust to jumps with arbitrary activity and to the presence of market microstructure noise. In an application of the test to SPY high-frequency data, we find evidence for rough volatility.</description>

      <title>Quantifying distribution system resilience from utility data: large event risk and benefits of investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on large blackouts in electric distribution systems caused by extreme winds. Such events have a large cost and impact on customers. To quantify resilience to these events, we formulate large event risk and show how to calculate it from the historical outage data routinely collected by utilities' outage management systems. Risk is defined using an event cost exceedance curve. The tail of this curve and the large event risk is described by the probability of a large cost event and the slope magnitude of the tail on a log-log plot. Resilience can be improved by planned investments to upgrade system components or speed up restoration. The benefits that these investments would have had if they had been made in the past can be quantified by "rerunning history" with the effects of the investment included, and then recalculating the large event risk to find the improvement in resilience. An example using utility data shows a 12% and 22% reduction in the probability of a large cost event due to 10% wind hardening and 10% faster restoration respectively. This new data-driven approach to quantify resilience and resilience investments is realistic and much easier to apply than complicated approaches based on modeling all the phases of resilience. Moreover, an appeal to improvements to past lived experience may well be persuasive to customers and regulators in making the case for resilience investments.</description>
