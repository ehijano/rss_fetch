      <title>Automorphisms of GKM graphs and regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A regular semisimple Hessenberg variety $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is a smooth subvariety of the full flag variety $\mathrm{Fl}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ associated with a regular semisimple matrix $S$ of order $n$ and a function $h$ from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ to itself satisfying a certain condition. We show that when $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is connected and not the entire space $\mathrm{Fl}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, the reductive part of the identity component $\mathrm{Aut}^0(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ of the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ of $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is an algebraic torus of dimension $n-1$ and $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))/\mathrm{Aut}^0(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ or $\mathfrak{S}_n\rtimes \{\pm 1\}$, where $\mathfrak{S}_n$ is the symmetric group of degree $n$. As a byproduct of our argument, we show that $\mathrm{Aut}(X)/\mathrm{Aut}^0(X)$ is a finite group for any projective GKM manifold $X$.</description>

      <title>Surface reconstruction of sampled textiles via Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the perception problem for garments using tools from computational topology: the identification of their geometry and position in space from point-cloud samples, as obtained e.g. with 3D scanners. We present a reconstruction algorithm based on a direct topological study of the sampled textile surface that allows us to obtain a cellular decomposition of it via a Morse function. No intermediate triangulation or local implicit equations are used, avoiding reconstruction-induced artifices. No a priori knowledge of the surface topology, density or regularity of the point-sample is required to run the algorithm. The results are a piecewise decomposition of the surface as a union of Morse cells (i.e. topological disks), suitable for tasks such as noise-filtering or mesh-independent reparametrization, and a cell complex of small rank determining the surface topology. This algorithm can be applied to smooth surfaces with or without boundary, embedded in an ambient space of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Derived deformation theory of algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.07255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to develop an explicit derived deformation theory of algebraic structures at a high level of generality, encompassing in a common framework various kinds of algebras (associative, commutative, Poisson...) or bialgebras (associative and coassociative, Lie, Frobenius...), that is algebraic structures parametrized by props. A central aspect is that we define and study moduli spaces of deformations of algebraic structures up to quasi-isomorphisms (and not just isotopies or isomorphisms). To do so, we implement methods coming from derived algebraic geometry, by encapsulating these deformation theories as classifying (pre)stacks with good infinitesimal properties and derived formal geometry, by means of derived formal moduli problems and derived formal groups. In particular, we prove that the Lie algebra describing the deformation theory of an object in a given $\infty$-category of dg algebras can be obtained equivalently as the tangent complex of loops on a derived quotient of this moduli space by the homotopy automorphims of this object. Moreover, we provide explicit formulae for such derived deformation problems of algebraic structures up to quasi-isomorphisms and relate them in a precise way to other standard deformation problems of algebraic structures. This relation is given by a fiber sequence of the associated dg-Lie algebras of their deformation complexes. Our results provide simultaneously a vast generalization of standard deformation theory of algebraic structures which is suitable (and needed) to set up algebraic deformation theory both at the $\infty$-categorical level and at a higher level of generality than algebras over operads. In addition, we study a general criterion to compare formal moduli problems of different algebraic structures and apply our formalism to $E_n$-algebras and bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Deloopings of Hurwitz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.13081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a partially multiplicative quandle (PMQ) $\mathcal{Q}$ we consider the topological monoid $\mathring{\mathrm{HM}}(\mathcal{Q})$ of Hurwitz spaces of configurations in the plane with local monodromies in $\mathcal{Q}$. We compute the group completion of $\mathring{\mathrm{HM}}(\mathcal{Q})$: it is the product of the (discrete) enveloping group $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{Q})$ with a component of the double loop space of the relative Hurwitz space $\mathrm{Hur}_+([0,1]^2,\partial[0,1]^2;\mathcal{Q},G)_{1\!\!\,1}$; here $G$ is any group giving rise, together with $\mathcal{Q}$, to a PMQ-group pair. Assuming further that $\mathcal{Q}$ is finite and rationally Poincare and that $G$ is finite, we compute the rational cohomology ring of $\mathrm{Hur}_+([0,1]^2,\partial[0,1]^2;\mathcal{Q},G)_{1\!\!\,1}$.</description>

      <title>On finite generation in magnitude (co)homology, and its torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to apply the framework, which was developed by Sam and Snowden, to study structural properties of graph homologies, in the spirit of Ramos, Miyata and Proudfoot. Our main results concern the magnitude homology of graphs introduced by Hepworth and Willerton. More precisely, for graphs of bounded genus, we prove that magnitude cohomology, in each homological degree, has rank which grows at most polynomially in the number of vertices, and that its torsion is bounded. As a consequence, we obtain analogous results for path homology of (undirected) graphs. We complement the work with a proof that the category of planar graphs of bounded genus and marked edges, with contractions, is quasi-Gr\"obner.</description>

      <title>Free decomposition spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of free decomposition spaces: they are simplicial spaces freely generated by their inert maps. We show that left Kan extension along the inclusion $j \colon \Delta_{\operatorname{inert}} \to \Delta$ takes general objects to M\"obius decomposition spaces and general maps to CULF maps. We establish an equivalence of $\infty$-categories $\mathbf{PrSh}(\Delta_{\operatorname{inert}}) \simeq \mathbf{Decomp}_{/B\mathbb{N}}$. Although free decomposition spaces are rather simple objects, they abound in combinatorics: it seems that all comultiplications of deconcatenation type arise from free decomposition spaces. We give an extensive list of examples, including quasi-symmetric functions.</description>

Abstract: We compute the upper characteristic rank of the projective Stiefel manifolds over $\mathbb R, \mathbb C$ and $\mathbb H$ and of the flip Stiefel manifolds. We provide bounds for the cup lengths of these spaces. We also provide necessary conditions for existence of $S^3$-map between quaternionic Stiefel manifolds using Fadell-Husseini index.</description>

      <title>Attending to Topological Spaces: The Cellular Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological Deep Learning seeks to enhance the predictive performance of neural network models by harnessing topological structures in input data. Topological neural networks operate on spaces such as cell complexes and hypergraphs, that can be seen as generalizations of graphs. In this work, we introduce the Cellular Transformer (CT), a novel architecture that generalizes graph-based transformers to cell complexes. First, we propose a new formulation of the usual self- and cross-attention mechanisms, tailored to leverage incidence relations in cell complexes, e.g., edge-face and node-edge relations. Additionally, we propose a set of topological positional encodings specifically designed for cell complexes. By transforming three graph datasets into cell complex datasets, our experiments reveal that CT not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but it does so without the need for more complex enhancements such as virtual nodes, in-domain structural encodings, or graph rewiring.</description>
